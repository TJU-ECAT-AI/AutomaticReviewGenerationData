[1] "When the silica hydroxyl groups were labeled with deuterium (ca. 90% SiOD, estimated by IR) prior to reaction with M(CH2R)4, the hydrocarbon released during grafting contained a single deuterium atom, RCH2D, in each case."
[2] "Treatment of 4 with 50 Torr of HCl(g) liberated (0.9  0.1) equiv of CMe4 as the only gaseous product."
[3] "When 13 were grafted onto deuterated silica and then thermolyzed at the temperatures shown in eqs 35, the EMe4 (E = C, Si) liberated was 100% undeuterated in each case."
[4] "Although similar labeling studies were not feasible for 2 and 3 (due to the unavailability of the selectively labeled Me3SiCD2 ligand), their behavior is so similar to that of 1 in all other respects (vide infra) that we propose analogous alkylidene formulations for 5 and 6."
[5] "The kinetics of each of the thermolysis reactions in eqs 35 were investigated."
[6] "The evolution of SiMe4 from 2 and 3 was monitored in the same way as for 1 and was, in both cases, first order."

[10] "The evolution of SiMe4 from 2 and 3 was monitored in the same way as for 1 and was, in both cases, first order."
[11] "The rate constants, Table 3, were used to construct a Eyring plot, which is also nonlinear, Figure 5b."

1. The silica-supported chromium complexes undergo clean thermal transformations to generate supported alkylidene complexes, releasing alkane molecules. The reactions are first order, indicating similar coordination environments on the surface. The temperature dependences of the first-order rate constants give nonlinear Eyring plots, suggesting a two-step mechanism involving reversible (alkyl)(alkylidene)CrVI hydride formation followed by reductive elimination of alkane.

2. The alumina-supported thorium hydrides, unlike the silica-supported chromium complexes, do not undergo clean thermal transformations to generate supported alkylidene complexes. Their behavior is not described in the provided literature, and thus, specific mechanisms for H/D exchange and alkane metathesis cannot be compared.

3. The kinetics of the thermolysis reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes are first order, with the rate constants varying with temperature. The Eyring plots are nonlinear for the chromium complexes, while they are linear for the vanadium complexes. The activation enthalpy (ΔH) for the vanadium complexes is 11.0 ± 1.0 kcal/mol, and the entropy change (ΔS) is 43 ± 3 cal K-1 mol-1, indicating surface assistance in the rate-determining step.

4. The role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in C-H bond activation reactions is not specifically discussed in the provided literature. However, the successful transformation of the chromium complexes to alkylidene complexes through thermal α-H elimination suggests that these processes may be involved in the mechanism of C-H bond activation for the silica-supported chromium complexes.

5. The role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in C-H bond activation reactions is not specifically discussed in the provided literature for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The lack of detailed information regarding these mechanisms makes direct comparison with the silica-supported chromium complexes impossible.

6. The selectivity of the reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is high, as indicated by the quantitative liberation of alkane molecules. The reaction rates are temperature-dependent, with the highest rates occurring at higher temperatures.

7. The selectivity of the reactions for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature. The lack of information regarding the selectivity of these reactions makes direct comparison with the silica-supported chromium complexes impossible.

8. The catalyst activity of the silica-supported chromium complexes is demonstrated by their ability to catalyze styrene polymerization, suggesting the potential for using these materials in industrial applications. The mechanism of this polymerization is currently under investigation.

9. The catalyst activity of the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature. The lack of information regarding the catalytic activity of these materials makes direct comparison with the silica-supported chromium complexes impossible.

10. The role of hydrogenolysis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is evident from the α-H elimination process, which liberates alkane molecules. The role of hydrogenolysis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature.

11. The role of σ-bond metathesis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is demonstrated by their ability to undergo metathesis with styrene and catalyze its polymerization. The role of σ-bond metathesis in the C-H bond activation reactions for the alumina-supported thorium hydrides is not described in the provided literature.

12. The role of chain walking in the C-H bond activation reactions for the silica-supported chromium complexes is not specifically discussed in the provided literature. Chain walking is typically associated with metathesis reactions, which is demonstrated for the silica-supported chromium complexes.
