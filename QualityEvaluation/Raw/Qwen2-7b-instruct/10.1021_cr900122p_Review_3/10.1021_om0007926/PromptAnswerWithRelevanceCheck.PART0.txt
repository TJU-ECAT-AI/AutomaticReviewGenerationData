[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."
[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."
[3] "More specifically, H2/D2 exchange to an equilibrium distribution was instantaneous even at liquid nitrogen temperatures."
[4] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."
[5] "These values are consistent with both theoretical and experimental studies of similar four-center processes. 10,11"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are known for their activity in olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of paraffins. They exhibit fast H/D exchange, particularly for H2/D2 and CH4/D2, with low activation energies and negative entropy of activation, indicative of a σ-bond metathesis mechanism. These characteristics are consistent with theoretical and experimental studies on similar four-center processes.

四烷基锆化物锚定在耐火金属氧化物支持上受到广泛关注，这些化合物对烷烃的活性包括CH激活、CC激活、异构化和氢解。之前已经有关于该催化剂系统的相关H/D交换反应的定性信息记录。我们制备的化合物和氢化物的谱图与通过升华技术获得的材料的谱图相似，这验证了制备方法的有效性。

[1] "We find that H2/D2 exchange is too fast for us to measure and that D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than exchange between CH4 and CD4 (results to be reported separately)."
[2] "The rate of CH4/D2 exchange data of the tantalum at 150 C is 10100 times slower than the exchange rate for Zr at 100 C."
[3] "The rate differences may be attributed to the greater electrophilic character of zirconium due in part to the differences in d electron configuration (d0 vs d2)."
[4] "Alternatively, one could also argue that the structure of the zirconium center may be more open compared to that of the tantalum system, hence allowing easier coordination of methane to the zirconium center."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
H2/D2 exchange is too rapid to measure, while D2/CH4 exchange is notably faster than the exchange between CH4 and CD4, with results yet to be published. The rate of CH4/D2 exchange for tantalum at 150°C is 10,100 times slower than the rate for zirconium at 100°C. These discrepancies can be attributed to zirconium's higher electrophilicity, partly due to its d electron configuration (d0 vs d2), or the potentially more open structure of the zirconium center facilitating easier coordination of methane.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
H2/D2交换太迅速以至于无法测量，而D2/CH4交换比CH4与CD4之间的交换快得多，具体结果将在后续报告中公布。150°C下钽的CH4/D2交换速率是10,100倍慢于100°C下锆的交换速率。这些差异可以归因于锆的更高亲电性，部分原因是其d电子构型（d0 vs d2），或者锆中心结构可能更开放，从而更容易使甲烷与锆中心配位。

[1] "The rate of exchange in the Zr system is much faster than that of the Ta system."
[2] "Despite this, it is clear that the rate of exchange in the Zr system is much faster than that of the Ta system."
[3] "The exchange reactions in the Ta system were reported at 150 C, a temperature at which we observe a slow deactivation of the zirconium catalyst."
[4] "Despite this, it is clear that the rate of exchange in the Zr system is much faster than that of the Ta system."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The exchange rate in the zirconium system is significantly higher than in the tantalum system. Despite the observation of slow deactivation of the zirconium catalyst at 150°C for the tantalum system, it is evident that the exchange rate in the zirconium system remains much faster than that of the tantalum system.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts studied exhibit rapid hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange kinetics, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, indicating a small activation energy (upper bound ≈ 2 kcal/mol) for this process. The exchange between methane and deuterium is particularly characterized by a high negative entropy of activation (≈ 27 eu) and a low energy of activation (≈ 7 kcal/mol), supporting the hypothesis that the reactions proceed via a σ-bond metathesis mechanism. This mechanism is consistent with theoretical and experimental studies of similar four-center processes, suggesting that the exchange involves the formation of a transition state with a four-center structure, facilitating the transfer of atoms between the catalyst and the substrate.

研究发现，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物催化剂在低温下表现出快速的氢/氘（H/D）交换动力学特性，表明该过程的活化能上限约为2 kcal/mol。甲烷与氘之间的交换特别具有高负熵活化能（约为27 eu）和较低的能量活化能（约为7 kcal/mol），这支持反应通过σ键互换机制进行的假设。这种机制与类似四中心过程的理论和实验研究结果一致，表明交换涉及形成一个包含四个中心的过渡态，促进催化剂与底物之间的原子转移。

Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions.
The rate and temperature dependence of H/D exchange between H2 and D2 and between CH4 and D2 was determined utilizing a glass recycle reactor in which reactants and products were repeatedly passed over the catalyst.
A sequential, single-atom exchange process was observed for both exchange processes.
We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol.

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct properties in their catalytic activities for C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are highly effective as olefin polymerization catalysts, and they also demonstrate the ability to activate carbon-hydrogen bonds under mild conditions, facilitating hydrogenolysis of paraffins. Notably, these materials exhibit a rapid H/D exchange process, with an estimated upper bound activation energy of approximately 2 kcal/mol, and a low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation for the CH4-D2 exchange, indicating a σ-bond metathesis mechanism.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are known to activate C-H bonds through alkane metathesis reactions. The mechanism follows a σ-bond metathesis pathway, as evidenced by the low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation. The rate of exchange in the silica-supported zirconium hydride system is notably faster than that of the alumina-supported thorium hydride system, suggesting differences in their catalytic efficiencies and reaction dynamics.

Both systems share a common σ-bond metathesis mechanism, which is supported by the observed low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation. However, the specific rates of reaction and selectivities differ, reflecting the unique structural and electronic properties of the zirconium and thorium centers within their respective supports.

硅基负载的锆化氢化合物在多个研究中被广泛研究，并被确认为高效共轭烯烃聚合催化剂。最近的研究表明，这些材料能够通过温和条件下的碳氢键激活催化烷烃的氢解反应。H/D交换过程的速率和温度依赖性通过使用玻璃循环反应器确定，该反应器可以重复地将反应物和产物通过催化剂。观察到两种交换过程都遵循单原子交换过程。我们估计激活能量的上限约为2 kcal/mol。此外，甲烷与D2之间的交换动力学表现出较大的负熵激活（27 ± 3 eu）和相对较低的能量激活（7 ± 1 kcal/mol），这与σ键重排途径一致。这一机制基于低能量激活和高负熵激活的证据。对于这种催化剂系统的相关H/D交换反应，先前已经提供了定性的信息。

对于氧化铝负载的钍化氢化合物而言，它们被发现能够激活烷烃中的C-H键，通过烷烃重排反应。这些反应通过σ键重排机制进行，这从低能量激活和高负熵激活的特征得到证实。硅基负载的锆化氢系统中的交换速率明显快于氧化铝负载的钍化氢系统。

两者都共享一种σ键重排机制，这是由观察到的低能量激活和高负熵激活所支持的。然而，反应速率和选择性存在差异，反映了锆和钍中心在其各自支持物内的独特结构和电子性质。
