Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts.
Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions.
The rate and temperature dependence of H/D exchange between H2 and D2 and between CH4 and D2 was determined utilizing a glass recycle reactor in which reactants and products were repeatedly passed over the catalyst.
A sequential, single-atom exchange process was observed for both exchange processes.
We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol.
Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway.
Evidence for this mechanism is based on the low energy of activation and the high negative entropy of activation.
Qualitative information on related H/D exchange reactions have been previously reported for this catalyst system.
In the case of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, they have been found to activate C-H bonds in alkane metathesis reactions.
These reactions proceed via a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, as indicated by the low energy of activation and the high negative entropy of activation.
The rate of exchange in the silica-supported zirconium hydride system is much faster than that of the alumina-supported thorium hydride system.

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct properties in their catalytic activities for C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides are highly effective as olefin polymerization catalysts, and they also demonstrate the ability to activate carbon-hydrogen bonds under mild conditions, facilitating hydrogenolysis of paraffins. Notably, these materials exhibit a rapid H/D exchange process, with an estimated upper bound activation energy of approximately 2 kcal/mol, and a low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation for the CH4-D2 exchange, indicating a σ-bond metathesis mechanism.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are known to activate C-H bonds through alkane metathesis reactions. The mechanism follows a σ-bond metathesis pathway, as evidenced by the low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation. The rate of exchange in the silica-supported zirconium hydride system is notably faster than that of the alumina-supported thorium hydride system, suggesting differences in their catalytic efficiencies and reaction dynamics.

Both systems share a common σ-bond metathesis mechanism, which is supported by the observed low energy of activation and high negative entropy of activation. However, the specific rates of reaction and selectivities differ, reflecting the unique structural and electronic properties of the zirconium and thorium centers within their respective supports.

硅基负载的锆化氢化合物在多个研究中被广泛研究，并被确认为高效共轭烯烃聚合催化剂。最近的研究表明，这些材料能够通过温和条件下的碳氢键激活催化烷烃的氢解反应。H/D交换过程的速率和温度依赖性通过使用玻璃循环反应器确定，该反应器可以重复地将反应物和产物通过催化剂。观察到两种交换过程都遵循单原子交换过程。我们估计激活能量的上限约为2 kcal/mol。此外，甲烷与D2之间的交换动力学表现出较大的负熵激活（27 ± 3 eu）和相对较低的能量激活（7 ± 1 kcal/mol），这与σ键重排途径一致。这一机制基于低能量激活和高负熵激活的证据。对于这种催化剂系统的相关H/D交换反应，先前已经提供了定性的信息。

对于氧化铝负载的钍化氢化合物而言，它们被发现能够激活烷烃中的C-H键，通过烷烃重排反应。这些反应通过σ键重排机制进行，这从低能量激活和高负熵激活的特征得到证实。硅基负载的锆化氢系统中的交换速率明显快于氧化铝负载的钍化氢系统。

两者都共享一种σ键重排机制，这是由观察到的低能量激活和高负熵激活所支持的。然而，反应速率和选择性存在差异，反映了锆和钍中心在其各自支持物内的独特结构和电子性质。
