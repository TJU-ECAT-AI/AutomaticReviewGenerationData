The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts studied exhibit rapid hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange kinetics, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, indicating a small activation energy (upper bound ≈ 2 kcal/mol) for this process. The exchange between methane and deuterium is particularly characterized by a high negative entropy of activation (≈ 27 eu) and a low energy of activation (≈ 7 kcal/mol), supporting the hypothesis that the reactions proceed via a σ-bond metathesis mechanism. This mechanism is consistent with theoretical and experimental studies of similar four-center processes, suggesting that the exchange involves the formation of a transition state with a four-center structure, facilitating the transfer of atoms between the catalyst and the substrate.

研究发现，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物催化剂在低温下表现出快速的氢/氘（H/D）交换动力学特性，表明该过程的活化能上限约为2 kcal/mol。甲烷与氘之间的交换特别具有高负熵活化能（约为27 eu）和较低的能量活化能（约为7 kcal/mol），这支持反应通过σ键互换机制进行的假设。这种机制与类似四中心过程的理论和实验研究结果一致，表明交换涉及形成一个包含四个中心的过渡态，促进催化剂与底物之间的原子转移。

The study focuses on understanding the nature and mechanism of action of silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts through detailed investigation of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange reactions. These catalysts, in their hydride form, are known to be active in olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, and isomerization. By examining the kinetics of H/D exchange, researchers aim to gather insights into the activation process and the underlying mechanisms, which are crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing our understanding of the chemical transformations involved. The obtained kinetic parameters align with theoretical and experimental findings on similar four-center processes, further validating the σ-bond metathesis mechanism proposed for these reactions.
