[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."
[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."
[3] "More specifically, H2/D2 exchange to an equilibrium distribution was instantaneous even at liquid nitrogen temperatures."
[4] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."
[5] "These values are consistent with both theoretical and experimental studies of similar four-center processes. 10,11"

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are known for their activity in olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of paraffins. They exhibit fast H/D exchange, particularly for H2/D2 and CH4/D2, with low activation energies and negative entropy of activation, indicative of a σ-bond metathesis mechanism. These characteristics are consistent with theoretical and experimental studies on similar four-center processes.

硅支持的锆化氢是烯烃聚合和烷烃氢解反应的高效催化剂。它们表现出快速的H/D交换，特别是对于H2/D2和CH4/D2，具有较低的活化能和负熵值，这符合σ键互换机制。这些特征与类似四中心过程的理论和实验研究一致。

Tetralkyl zirconium complexes anchored on refractory metal oxide supports are widely studied for their reactivity with paraffins, encompassing CH activation, CC activation, hydroisomerization, and hydrogenolysis. Prior qualitative insights into H/D exchange reactions for this catalyst system are documented. The prepared complexes and hydrides exhibit spectra akin to those of sublimation-derived materials, validating the preparation methods.

四烷基锆化物锚定在耐火金属氧化物支持上受到广泛关注，这些化合物对烷烃的活性包括CH激活、CC激活、异构化和氢解。之前已经有关于该催化剂系统的相关H/D交换反应的定性信息记录。我们制备的化合物和氢化物的谱图与通过升华技术获得的材料的谱图相似，这验证了制备方法的有效性。

[1] "We find that H2/D2 exchange is too fast for us to measure and that D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than exchange between CH4 and CD4 (results to be reported separately)."
[2] "The rate of CH4/D2 exchange data of the tantalum at 150 C is 10100 times slower than the exchange rate for Zr at 100 C."
[3] "The rate differences may be attributed to the greater electrophilic character of zirconium due in part to the differences in d electron configuration (d0 vs d2)."
[4] "Alternatively, one could also argue that the structure of the zirconium center may be more open compared to that of the tantalum system, hence allowing easier coordination of methane to the zirconium center."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
H2/D2 exchange is too rapid to measure, while D2/CH4 exchange is notably faster than the exchange between CH4 and CD4, with results yet to be published. The rate of CH4/D2 exchange for tantalum at 150°C is 10,100 times slower than the rate for zirconium at 100°C. These discrepancies can be attributed to zirconium's higher electrophilicity, partly due to its d electron configuration (d0 vs d2), or the potentially more open structure of the zirconium center facilitating easier coordination of methane.

H2/D2交换太迅速以至于无法测量，而D2/CH4交换比CH4与CD4之间的交换快得多，具体结果将在后续报告中公布。150°C下钽的CH4/D2交换速率是10,100倍慢于100°C下锆的交换速率。这些差异可以归因于锆的更高亲电性，部分原因是其d电子构型（d0 vs d2），或者锆中心结构可能更开放，从而更容易使甲烷与锆中心配位。

[1] "The rate of exchange in the Zr system is much faster than that of the Ta system."
[2] "Despite this, it is clear that the rate of exchange in the Zr system is much faster than that of the Ta system."
[3] "The exchange reactions in the Ta system were reported at 150 C, a temperature at which we observe a slow deactivation of the zirconium catalyst."
[4] "Despite this, it is clear that the rate of exchange in the Zr system is much faster than that of the Ta system."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The exchange rate in the zirconium system is significantly higher than in the tantalum system. Despite the observation of slow deactivation of the zirconium catalyst at 150°C for the tantalum system, it is evident that the exchange rate in the zirconium system remains much faster than that of the tantalum system.

锆系统的交换速率明显高于钽系统。尽管观察到在150°C下钽系统的锆催化剂存在缓慢失活现象，但很明显，锆系统的交换速率仍然远高于钽系统。
