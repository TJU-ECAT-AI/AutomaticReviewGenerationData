[1] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."
[2] "We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol."
[3] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."
[4] "These values are consistent with both theoretical and experimental studies of similar four-center processes. 10,11"

The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts exhibit high activity in hydrogenolysis of paraffins, activating carbon-hydrogen bonds under mild conditions. The activation energy for H/D exchange is estimated to be around 2 kcal/mol, indicating a rapid exchange process. The exchange kinetics between methane and deuterium show a large negative entropy of activation (27 ± 3 eu) and a low energy of activation (7 ± 1 kcal/mol), suggesting a σ-bond metathesis mechanism. These findings align with theoretical and experimental studies on similar four-center processes.

硅基载锌催化剂在温和条件下表现出对烷烃氢解的高度活性，激活碳氢键。H/D交换的活化能估计约为2 kcal/mol，表明一个快速的交换过程。甲烷与重水之间的交换动力学具有较大的负熵活化能（27±3 eu）和较低的能量活化能（7±1 kcal/mol），暗示σ键互换机制。这些结果与类似四中心过程的理论和实验研究相一致。
