[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."
[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."
[3] "We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol."
[4] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27 ± 3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7 ± 1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."
[5] "The reactions of paraffins with these catalysts, to undergo either CH or CC bond activation, is assumed to proceed by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism."
[6] "Evidence for this mechanism is based on the low energy of activation and the high negative entropy of activation."
[7] "We would also argue against a metalmethyl transition state, both on the basis of increased steric hindrance and on the kinetics we observe."

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity in olefin polymerization and hydrogenolysis of paraffins under mild conditions. They have a relatively low activation energy for hydrogenolysis, estimated to be around 2 kcal/mol, and the exchange kinetics between methane and deuterium show a large negative entropy of activation (27 ± 3 eu) and a low energy of activation (7 ± 1 kcal/mol), indicating a σ-bond metathesis mechanism. This mechanism is further supported by the low energy and high negative entropy of activation. The catalysts do not favor a metalmethyl transition state due to increased steric hindrance and the observed kinetics.

二氧化硅支持的锆化氢在烯烃聚合和烷烃氢解反应中表现出高活性，并且在温和条件下进行。它们的氢解反应的活化能估计约为2 kcal/mol，甲烷与重水之间的交换动力学显示较大的负熵活化能（27±3 eu）和较低的能量活化能（7±1 kcal/mol），这表明存在σ键重排机制。这一机制进一步通过低能量和高负熵活化能得到证实。催化剂不倾向于金属甲基过渡状态，这是由于增加了空间阻碍和观察到的动力学性质。
