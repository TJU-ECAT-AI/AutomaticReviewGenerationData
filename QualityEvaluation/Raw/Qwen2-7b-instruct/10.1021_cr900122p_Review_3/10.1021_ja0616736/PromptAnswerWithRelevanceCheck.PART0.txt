<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions reveals distinct preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are more reactive in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit enhanced stability and selectivity. Mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking play crucial roles in these processes, affecting reaction rates and selectivity differently for each type of catalyst.
