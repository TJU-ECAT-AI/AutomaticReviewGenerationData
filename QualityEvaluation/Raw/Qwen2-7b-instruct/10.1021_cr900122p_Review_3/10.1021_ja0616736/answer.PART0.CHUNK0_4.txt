The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were studied through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. These catalysts were evaluated based on their reaction rates, selectivity, and mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The study highlighted the significance of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.
