The document combines experimental data and theoretical analysis to explore the molecular understanding of alumina-supported single-site catalysts. It compares silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in terms of their application in C-H bond activation reactions, focusing on the mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The study also examines the impact of reaction rates, selectivity, and the involvement of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking on the overall catalytic properties.
