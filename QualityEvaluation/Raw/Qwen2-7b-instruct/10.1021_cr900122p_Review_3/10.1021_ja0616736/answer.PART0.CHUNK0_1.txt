The comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions reveals distinct preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are more reactive in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit enhanced stability and selectivity. Mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking play crucial roles in these processes, affecting reaction rates and selectivity differently for each type of catalyst.

在C-H键活化反应中，对二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物的比较显示了它们在制备、结构和催化性质上的显著差异。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物在H/D交换和烷烃裂合过程中表现出更高的反应性，而氧化铝支持的钍氢化物则显示出增强的稳定性和选择性。σ键裂解、氢解离和链行走等机制在这些过程中发挥着关键作用，对两种催化剂类型的影响也不同，影响反应速率和选择性。
