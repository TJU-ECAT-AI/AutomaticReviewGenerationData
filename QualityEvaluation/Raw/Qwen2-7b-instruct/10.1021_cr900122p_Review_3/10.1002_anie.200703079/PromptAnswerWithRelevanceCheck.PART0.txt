[1] "Herein we report that an alkylidyne moiety in [(PNP)TiCtBu] (A; PNP=[2-{P(CHMe2)2}-4-methylphenyl]2N), generated from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)] (1),6 can be conveniently stabilized with Al(CH3)3 to afford the first example of a Lewis acid stabilized Group4 alkylidyne [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2)."
[2] "We also demonstrate that complex 2 is remarkably stable, but in the presence of pyridine behaves as an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, thus cleanly ring opening the strong CN bond of the N-heterocycle."
[3] "During the course of our studies we discovered that complex 1 can cleave the BO bond of the Lewis acid B(OCH3)3 to afford an unusual titanium complex containing an alkylidene ligand substituted with an electrophilic motif B(OCH3)2."
[4] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[5] "Treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2).9"

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of an alkylidyne titanium compound, specifically [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2), which is an alkylidyne analog of Tebbe's reagent. It is prepared by stabilizing an alkylidyne moiety derived from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)] (1) with Al(CH3)3. This compound is remarkable for its stability until the presence of pyridine, whereupon it acts as an alkylidyne analogue, cleanly ring-opening the strong CN bond of a N-heterocycle. Furthermore, the document reveals that complex 1, from which 2 is derived, can cleave the BO bond of the Lewis acid B(OCH3)3, leading to an unusual titanium complex with an alkylidene ligand containing an electrophilic motif B(OCH3)2. Lastly, it is speculated that both paths B and C are operational in the reactions leading to the formation of 2, indicating that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, path A, is not formed.

该文档讨论了一种烷基二烯钛化合物[(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}]（2）的制备、结构和催化性质，它是Tebbe试剂的烷基二烯类衍生物。通过将来源于[(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)]（1）的烷基二烯基团与Al(CH3)3稳定化来制备此化合物。这种化合物在存在吡啶的情况下表现出显著稳定性，此时它作为烷基二烯类类似物，清洁地打开强CN键的氮杂环。此外，文档揭示了复合物1（从2的来源），可以切割Lewis酸B(OCH3)3的BO键，导致含有一个带有电性特征B(OCH3)2的烷基二烯基钛化合物的不寻常钛化合物。最后，推测在形成2的反应中，路径B和C都是有效的，这表明裸露的烷基二烯中间体，路径A并未形成。

[1] "Tebbe's reagent, [Cp2Ti{CH2AlCl(CH3)2}],3 a Lewis acid stabilized methylidene complex prepared from addition of two equivalents of Al(CH3)3 to [Cp2TiCl2] [Eq.(1)], was one of the first reported early-transition-metal systems to perform olefin metathesis in a catalytic manner."

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, specifically focusing on the titanium alkylidyne complex 2. This complex is generated through incomplete addition of trimethylaluminum to a {TiCtBu} moiety. In contrast, B(OCH3)3 completely adds to the precursor by BO bond cleavage, forming an unusual alkylidene. The study also highlights that the titanium alkylidyne complex 2 can ring-open pyridine, demonstrating its potential as an alkylidyne reagent in organic synthesis. Furthermore, the research suggests that the formation of the alkylidyne complex 2 proceeds through pathways involving incomplete addition, alpha-hydrogen abstraction, and potentially the cleavage of the BO bond of a Lewis acid. Lastly, the document reports that when complex 2 is in the presence of pyridine, it extrudes the protective Al(CH3)3 group, behaving as a naked alkylidyne and ultimately ring-opening the pyridine molecule.

An Alkylidyne Analogue of Tebbe's Reagent: Trapping Reactions of a Titanium Neopentylidyne by Incomplete and Complete 1,2-Additions

[1] "Complex 2, a masked alkylidyne titanium compound, also ring-opens pyridine."
[2] "Tebbe's reagent was first prepared almost 30years ago, examples of an alkylidyne analogue for this seminal species have remained elusive, presumably because of the incipient negative charge confined at the TiC multiply bonded α-carbon atom."
[3] "In contrast, B(OCH3)3 completely adds to 1 by BO bond cleavage to afford an unusual alkylidene."
[4] "Our inability to trap the alkylidyne moiety in A by addition of Lewis bases, such as PR3 (R=CH3, Ph), THF, HMPA (hexamethyl phosphoramide), OP(CH3)3, and pyridines,7,8 prompted us to investigate whether the nucleophilic nature in the TiC linkage could be sequestered by a Lewis acid, such as Al(CH3)3."
[5] "Interestingly, the 13C and 13C{1H} NMR spectrum of 2 reveals a resonance at δ=333.0ppm for a highly deshielded carbon atom, which is consistent with a TiC multiply bonded functionality."
[6] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[7] "However, treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2)."

The document discusses the synthesis, structure, and catalytic properties of an alkylidyne analogue derived from a titanium compound. This analogue, referred to as complex 2, exhibits unique chemical behavior when exposed to Lewis bases and mild electrophiles. Specifically, when complex 2 interacts with pyridine, it releases the protecting group (Al(CH3)3) and acts as a naked titanium alkylidyne, ultimately facilitating the ring-opening of pyridine. In contrast to incomplete 1,2-addition reactions involving the TiC linkage, milder electrophiles like B(OCH3)3 lead to the formation of an unprecedented titanium alkylidene incorporating the B(OCH3)2 moiety. This demonstrates the versatility and reactivity of the synthesized alkylidyne complex in various organic transformations.

文档讨论了从钛化合物衍生的一种烷基炔类的合成、结构和催化性质。这种衍生物，称为复合物2，当与Lewis碱相互作用时表现出独特的化学行为。具体来说，当复合物2与吡啶相互作用时，它会释放保护基团（Al(CH3)3），并作为裸露的钛烷基炔发挥作用，最终导致吡啶环的打开。与通过TiC键进行的不完全1,2-加成反应不同，较温和的电子体如B(OCH3)3导致形成一种前所未有的钛烷基炔，其中包含B(OCH3)2基团。这表明合成的烷基炔复合物在各种有机转化中具有多变性和反应性。
