An Alkylidyne Analogue of Tebbe's Reagent: Trapping Reactions of a Titanium Neopentylidyne by Incomplete and Complete 1,2-Additions

[1] "Complex 2, a masked alkylidyne titanium compound, also ring-opens pyridine."
[2] "Tebbe's reagent was first prepared almost 30years ago, examples of an alkylidyne analogue for this seminal species have remained elusive, presumably because of the incipient negative charge confined at the TiC multiply bonded α-carbon atom."
[3] "In contrast, B(OCH3)3 completely adds to 1 by BO bond cleavage to afford an unusual alkylidene."
[4] "Our inability to trap the alkylidyne moiety in A by addition of Lewis bases, such as PR3 (R=CH3, Ph), THF, HMPA (hexamethyl phosphoramide), OP(CH3)3, and pyridines,7,8 prompted us to investigate whether the nucleophilic nature in the TiC linkage could be sequestered by a Lewis acid, such as Al(CH3)3."
[5] "Interestingly, the 13C and 13C{1H} NMR spectrum of 2 reveals a resonance at δ=333.0ppm for a highly deshielded carbon atom, which is consistent with a TiC multiply bonded functionality."
[6] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[7] "However, treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2)."

The document discusses the synthesis, structure, and catalytic properties of an alkylidyne analogue derived from a titanium compound. This analogue, referred to as complex 2, exhibits unique chemical behavior when exposed to Lewis bases and mild electrophiles. Specifically, when complex 2 interacts with pyridine, it releases the protecting group (Al(CH3)3) and acts as a naked titanium alkylidyne, ultimately facilitating the ring-opening of pyridine. In contrast to incomplete 1,2-addition reactions involving the TiC linkage, milder electrophiles like B(OCH3)3 lead to the formation of an unprecedented titanium alkylidene incorporating the B(OCH3)2 moiety. This demonstrates the versatility and reactivity of the synthesized alkylidyne complex in various organic transformations.

文档讨论了从钛化合物衍生的一种烷基炔类的合成、结构和催化性质。这种衍生物，称为复合物2，当与Lewis碱相互作用时表现出独特的化学行为。具体来说，当复合物2与吡啶相互作用时，它会释放保护基团（Al(CH3)3），并作为裸露的钛烷基炔发挥作用，最终导致吡啶环的打开。与通过TiC键进行的不完全1,2-加成反应不同，较温和的电子体如B(OCH3)3导致形成一种前所未有的钛烷基炔，其中包含B(OCH3)2基团。这表明合成的烷基炔复合物在各种有机转化中具有多变性和反应性。
