[1] "Tebbe's reagent, [Cp2Ti{CH2AlCl(CH3)2}],3 a Lewis acid stabilized methylidene complex prepared from addition of two equivalents of Al(CH3)3 to [Cp2TiCl2] [Eq.(1)], was one of the first reported early-transition-metal systems to perform olefin metathesis in a catalytic manner."
[2] "Complex 2, a masked alkylidyne titanium compound, also ring-opens pyridine."
[3] "During the course of our studies we discovered that complex 1 can cleave the BO bond of the Lewis acid B(OCH3)3 to afford an unusual titanium complex containing an alkylidene ligand substituted with an electrophilic motif B(OCH3)2."
[4] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[5] "In the presence of pyridine, 2 extrudes the Al(CH3)3 protecting group, thus behaving as a naked titanium alkylidyne, ultimately ring opening the N-heterocycle."

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, specifically focusing on the titanium alkylidyne complex 2. This complex is generated through incomplete addition of trimethylaluminum to a {TiCtBu} moiety. In contrast, B(OCH3)3 completely adds to the precursor by BO bond cleavage, forming an unusual alkylidene. The study also highlights that the titanium alkylidyne complex 2 can ring-open pyridine, demonstrating its potential as an alkylidyne reagent in organic synthesis. Furthermore, the research suggests that the formation of the alkylidyne complex 2 proceeds through pathways involving incomplete addition, alpha-hydrogen abstraction, and potentially the cleavage of the BO bond of a Lewis acid. Lastly, the document reports that when complex 2 is in the presence of pyridine, it extrudes the protective Al(CH3)3 group, behaving as a naked alkylidyne and ultimately ring-opening the pyridine molecule.

文档讨论了Tebe的试剂的烷基二烯类衍生物的制备、结构和催化性质，主要集中在钛烷基二烯化合物2。该化合物通过不完全添加三甲基铝到{TiCtBu}基团中生成。相比之下，B(OCH3)3通过BO键断裂完全添加到前体中，形成一个不寻常的烷基二烯。研究还强调，钛烷基二烯化合物2能够打开吡啶环，表明其在有机合成中的潜力作为烷基二烯试剂。此外，研究表明，钛烷基二烯化合物2的形成途径包括不完全添加、α氢原子抽取，以及可能通过裂解Lewis酸的BO键。最后，文档报告，在吡啶的存在下，当复合物2被吡啶打开时，它会排出保护性Al(CH3)3组分，表现出裸露的烷基二烯，并最终打开吡啶分子。
