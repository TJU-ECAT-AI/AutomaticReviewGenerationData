[1] "Herein we report that an alkylidyne moiety in [(PNP)TiCtBu] (A; PNP=[2-{P(CHMe2)2}-4-methylphenyl]2N), generated from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)] (1),6 can be conveniently stabilized with Al(CH3)3 to afford the first example of a Lewis acid stabilized Group4 alkylidyne [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2)."
[2] "We also demonstrate that complex 2 is remarkably stable, but in the presence of pyridine behaves as an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, thus cleanly ring opening the strong CN bond of the N-heterocycle."
[3] "During the course of our studies we discovered that complex 1 can cleave the BO bond of the Lewis acid B(OCH3)3 to afford an unusual titanium complex containing an alkylidene ligand substituted with an electrophilic motif B(OCH3)2."
[4] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[5] "Treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2).9"

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of an alkylidyne titanium compound, specifically [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2), which is an alkylidyne analog of Tebbe's reagent. It is prepared by stabilizing an alkylidyne moiety derived from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)] (1) with Al(CH3)3. This compound is remarkable for its stability until the presence of pyridine, whereupon it acts as an alkylidyne analogue, cleanly ring-opening the strong CN bond of a N-heterocycle. Furthermore, the document reveals that complex 1, from which 2 is derived, can cleave the BO bond of the Lewis acid B(OCH3)3, leading to an unusual titanium complex with an alkylidene ligand containing an electrophilic motif B(OCH3)2. Lastly, it is speculated that both paths B and C are operational in the reactions leading to the formation of 2, indicating that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, path A, is not formed.

该文档讨论了一种烷基二烯钛化合物[(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}]（2）的制备、结构和催化性质，它是Tebbe试剂的烷基二烯类衍生物。通过将来源于[(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)]（1）的烷基二烯基团与Al(CH3)3稳定化来制备此化合物。这种化合物在存在吡啶的情况下表现出显著稳定性，此时它作为烷基二烯类类似物，清洁地打开强CN键的氮杂环。此外，文档揭示了复合物1（从2的来源），可以切割Lewis酸B(OCH3)3的BO键，导致含有一个带有电性特征B(OCH3)2的烷基二烯基钛化合物的不寻常钛化合物。最后，推测在形成2的反应中，路径B和C都是有效的，这表明裸露的烷基二烯中间体，路径A并未形成。
