[1] "In the case of silica-supported zirconium hydrides, the mechanism of H/D exchange is primarily driven by the formation of a hydride intermediate, which subsequently undergoes σ-bond metathesis to yield the desired product."
[2] "For alumina-supported thorium hydrides, the catalytic activity is influenced by the interaction between the thorium hydride species and the surface of the alumina support. This interaction facilitates the activation of the C-H bonds and the subsequent alkane metathesis reactions."
[3] "The reaction rates for both silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are influenced by the surface area and porosity of the support materials. Higher surface areas and porosities generally lead to faster reaction rates."
[4] "Selectivity in both systems is affected by the choice of the support material and the specific conditions under which the reactions are carried out. Silica supports tend to offer better selectivity for H/D exchange reactions, while alumina supports are advantageous for alkane metathesis."
[5] "The mechanism for H/D exchange typically involves the formation of a hydride intermediate, followed by σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis. Chain walking is not a significant factor in this process."
[6] "In alkane metathesis reactions catalyzed by alumina-supported thorium hydrides, the mechanism often involves the activation of C-H bonds by the thorium hydride species, leading to the rearrangement of alkene double bonds. Chain walking can play a role in controlling the regioselectivity of the reactions."

1. The H/D exchange mechanism for silica-supported zirconium hydrides involves the formation of a hydride intermediate, which undergoes σ-bond metathesis for product formation.
2. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides facilitate alkane metathesis reactions through the interaction between thorium hydride species and the alumina support surface.
3. Reaction rates for both systems are influenced by the surface area and porosity of the support materials, with higher values generally leading to faster rates.
4. Selectivity is determined by the support material and reaction conditions, offering better selectivity with silica supports for H/D exchange and alumina supports for alkane metathesis.
5. H/D exchange mechanisms involve the formation of a hydride intermediate, followed by σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis, with chain walking not being a significant factor.
6. Alkane metathesis catalyzed by alumina-supported thorium hydrides activates C-H bonds, leading to alkene double bond rearrangements, with chain walking influencing regioselectivity.

1. 对于二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物，H/D交换机制主要由氢中间体的形成驱动，随后进行σ键互换以生成所需产物。
2. 对于氧化铝支持的钍氢化物，催化活性受到钍氢化物种与氧化铝支撑表面之间相互作用的影响。这种相互作用促进了碳氢键的活化和随后的烷烃互换反应。
3. 这两个系统的反应速率受支撑材料的表面积和孔隙率的影响，较高的值通常导致更快的速率。
4. 选择性由支持材料和反应条件决定，对于H/D交换提供更好的选择性使用二氧化硅支持，而对于烷烃互换使用氧化铝支持。
5. H/D交换机制涉及形成氢中间体，随后进行σ键互换和氢解离，链行走在这一过程中不是重要因素。
6. 使用氧化铝支持的钍氢化物催化烷烃互换激活碳氢键，导致烯烃双键重组，链行走影响区域选择性。
