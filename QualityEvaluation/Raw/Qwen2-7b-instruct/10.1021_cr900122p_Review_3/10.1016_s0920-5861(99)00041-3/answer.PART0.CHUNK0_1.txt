[1] "The mechanism which operates in these cases usually involves a fundamental contribution of alkyl radical species which are generated at the catalyst surface and then: (i) react quickly in the adsorbed state (for instance, by being transformed to the corresponding olen via b-elimination, or by undergoing non-selective oxidative attack by adsorbed oxygen species), (ii) react further in the close proximity to the catalyst surface (i.e. in the boundary layer), or (iii) become transferred into the gas phase where the reaction proceeds."
[2] "Rare earth oxides, which are p- type semiconductors (La2O3, Sm2O3, Dy2O3),even though ionic-type conductivity can contribute in some cases [127136]. Cerium and praseodymium oxides (which instead are n-type semiconductors, and also exhibit remarkable ionic conductivity) are nonselective to"

The mechanism for alkane oxidation over rare earth oxides typically involves the generation of alkyl radical species at the catalyst surface. These radicals can react quickly in the adsorbed state, transforming into the corresponding olefin via β-elimination or undergoing oxidative attack by adsorbed oxygen species. They may also react further in the close proximity to the catalyst surface (boundary layer) or be transferred into the gas phase where the reaction continues. Cerium and praseodymium oxides, being n-type semiconductors, are nonselective in the oxidation of alkanes.

这些机制通常涉及在催化剂表面生成烷基自由基物种。这些自由基可以快速在吸附状态下反应，通过β消除转化为相应的烯烃，或者通过吸附氧物种的氧化攻击。它们也可能在催化剂表面附近（边界层）进一步反应，或者转移到气相中，在那里反应继续进行。铈和镨氧化物是n型半导体，因此对烷烃氧化不具有选择性。
