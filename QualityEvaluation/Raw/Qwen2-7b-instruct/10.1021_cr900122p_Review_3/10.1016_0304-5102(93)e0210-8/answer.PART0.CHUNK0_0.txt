<p>Initial organometallic surface chemical probes developed in this laboratory were organoactinide molecules [61]. Their chemistry differs distinctively from that of typical middle-late transition metal organometallics in a number of ways, including the pronounced stability of certain highly preferred oxidation states. Thus, a key reaction pathway that is ubiquitous in middle-late transition metal chemistry and homogeneous catalysis, i.e., coupled two-electron oxidative addition-reductive elimination sequences, is energetically unfeasible. For example, 4+ is virtually the only known oxidation state for thorium (oxidation is impossible, reduction is exceedingly difficult) [7]. Furthermore, the solution phase chemistry, spectroscopy, and thermochemistry of organoactinides is reaching an instructive level of development.</p>
<p>The understanding of the unique surface coordination environments that give rise to such reactivity enhancements and the tailoring of these sites for more chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective catalysis is of fundamental scientific and technological importance.</p>
<p>Supported organoactinide catalysts as embodied by Th($-allyl),/DA are competent for several demanding chemical transformations. While the active sites are likely to be electrophilic and coordinatively unsaturated, these data also suggest non-negligible ancillary ligation having steric and stereochemical consequences. Future research will continue to explore the scope and mechanism of catalytic transformations possible only at unsaturated, supported organo-f-element centers, as well as the investigation of homogeneous analogues.</p>

The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions differ significantly. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides facilitate H/D exchange and alkane metathesis through mechanisms involving σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The rate of these reactions, selectivity, and the roles of these mechanisms depend on the specific structure and coordination environment of the zirconium center. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides display catalytic properties for demanding chemical transformations such as arene hydrogenation and alkane activation. The active sites are likely electrophilic and coordinatively unsaturated, suggesting non-negligible ancillary ligation with steric and stereochemical consequences. Future research aims to explore the scope and mechanism of catalytic transformations possible at unsaturated, supported organo-f-element centers and to investigate homogeneous analogues of these systems.

硅基支持的锆化氢和氧化铝基支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质存在显著差异。硅基支持的锆化氢通过涉及σ键裂解、氢解离和链行走的机制促进H/D交换和烷烃互换。这些反应的速率、选择性和这些机制的作用依赖于锆中心的具体结构和配位环境。相反，氧化铝基支持的钍化氢显示出对如芳环氢化和烷烃激活等具有挑战性的化学转变的催化能力。活性位点可能是电负性的，并且是不饱和的，暗示着非忽视的辅助配位具有立体化学和空间效应。未来研究将探索仅在不饱和、支持的有机-f元素中心上可能发生的催化转化的范围和机制，并调查这些系统的同质类似物。
