The literature discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, focusing on their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. 

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are known for their ability to activate C-H bonds in alkane molecules, facilitating H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. These catalysts typically exhibit fast reaction rates and high selectivity, with mechanisms involving σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The catalysts are often active for demanding chemical transformations, showing potential for the functionalization of inert alkane molecules with favorable rates and selectivities.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, are demonstrated to be highly active catalysts for several challenging chemical transformations. They are capable of activating C-H bonds in alkane molecules, leading to H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. These catalysts are characterized by their electrophilic and coordinatively unsaturated active sites, which are believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic processes. The literature suggests that the active sites may involve non-negligible ancillary ligations that contribute to the steric and stereochemical properties of the catalysts.

The literature highlights that the alumina-supported thorium hydrides show superior catalytic properties compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides in terms of reaction rates, selectivity, and efficiency in C-H bond activation. The studies indicate that the alumina-supported thorium hydrides can catalyze the rapid polymerization of ethylene, hydrogenation of propylene, and hydrogenation of sterically hindered olefins, demonstrating their capability to handle demanding chemical transformations.

The mechanisms underlying the C-H bond activation in these catalysts involve a combination of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, contributing to the high reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. The literature also discusses the role of the metal oxide support in creating an organothorium cation and potentially playing a role in heterolytic hydrogen delivery and arene activation.

In conclusion, the literature provides insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides, emphasizing their capabilities in C-H bond activation reactions, including H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The alumina-supported thorium hydrides are highlighted for their superior performance in terms of reaction rates, selectivity, and efficiency, making them promising candidates for demanding chemical transformations.
