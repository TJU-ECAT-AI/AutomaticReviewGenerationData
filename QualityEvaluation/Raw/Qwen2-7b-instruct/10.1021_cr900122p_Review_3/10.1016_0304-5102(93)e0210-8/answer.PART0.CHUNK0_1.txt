<p>Assuming benzene and p-xylene compete for the same adsorption-hydrogenation sites,that site equilibration between the two substrates is more rapid than hydrogenation,and that the basic pattern of Scheme 3 also obtains for p-xylene reduction, the relative rates of benzene and p-xylene hydrogenation can be expressed as in eqn.

1. The literature discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their structure and mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. 

2. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides have different catalytic properties in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The rates of these reactions depend on factors like the structure of the catalyst, the nature of the substrates, and the mechanism of activation.

3. The selectivity of the reactions varies, with some showing high preference for certain products. The selectivity is influenced by the structure of the catalyst and the mechanism of activation.

4. The mechanisms involve steps like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. These processes are facilitated by the specific structures of the catalysts and the nature of the substrates.

5. The literature provides kinetic data for the catalytic hydrogenation of benzene, indicating that the rate of hydrogenation is zero-order in arene and first-order in hydrogen pressure. The benzene hydrogenation rate by supported thorium hydrides is compared to that of well-known homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.

6. The literature discusses the hydrogenation of arenes by supported organoactinides, focusing on the mechanism and selectivity of the reactions. The hydrogenation of p-xylene by supported thorium hydrides shows a deviation from the behavior of conventional heterogeneous catalysts in terms of the products formed.

7. The literature presents kinetic data for the catalytic hydrogenation of benzene, showing that the hydrogenation rate for supported thorium hydrides is much higher than that of homogeneous catalysts. This suggests that the supported thorium hydrides are highly efficient in hydrogenation reactions.

8. The literature describes the hydrogenation of p-xylene by supported thorium hydrides, highlighting the difference in the hydrogenation behavior compared to conventional heterogeneous catalysts. The literature also discusses the hydrogenation of sterically hindered olefins, showing that supported thorium hydrides can effectively hydrogenate such compounds.

9. The literature provides information on the catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in alkane activation reactions. It discusses the rates, selectivity, and mechanisms involved in these reactions.

10. The literature explains that the alumina support plays a crucial role in creating an organothorium cation and potentially affects the mechanisms of activation. The literature also mentions the potential involvement of the alumina support in heterolytic hydrogen delivery or arene activation.

11. The literature suggests that future research will continue to explore the scope and mechanism of catalytic transformations possible only at unsaturated, supported organo-f-element centers, as well as the investigation of homogeneous analogues.
