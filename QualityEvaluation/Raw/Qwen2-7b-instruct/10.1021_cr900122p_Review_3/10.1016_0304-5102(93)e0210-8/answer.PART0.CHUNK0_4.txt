[1] "The un- 
derstanding of the unique surface coordination environments that give rise to such reactivity enhancements and the tailoring of these sites for more chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective catalysis is of fundamental scientific and technological importance."
[2] "We find Nt for cyclohexene hydrogenation by 3/DA to be > 540000 h- at 9OC,190 psi H,. These latter two chemical transformations can be assessed to be sterically rather demanding from what is known about related homogeneous early transition metal [ 11,211 and organo- f-element catalysts [ 10,22,23]."
[3] "The most reasonable accommodation of these observations would be dissociation-reassociation of the partially hydrogenated arenes,possibly at the diene (after step 3) or olefin (after step 5) stage."

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation, both catalysts exhibit remarkable reactivity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are known for their ability to activate C-H bonds through σ-bond metathesis, leading to H/D exchange. The zirconium center facilitates the cleavage of the C-H bond and the subsequent addition of deuterium, resulting in the formation of the desired product. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides show efficient alkane metathesis reactions, driven by the thorium center's electrophilicity and coordination unsaturation. These catalysts enable the exchange of hydrogen atoms for deuterium atoms, leading to the formation of the target compound. The mechanism in both cases involves the activation of the alkane or aromatic compound at the supported metal center, followed by the addition of hydrogen or deuterium atoms. The selectivity and efficiency of these processes are influenced by factors such as the electronic properties of the metal center, the nature of the support material, and the specific coordination environment around the metal.

The rates of these reactions depend on the specific catalyst system, the substrate, and the reaction conditions. High rates are often achieved due to the enhanced reactivity provided by the supported metal center compared to their homogeneous counterparts. Selectivity in H/D exchange is typically high, with the catalysts showing preference for the introduction of deuterium atoms at specific positions within the alkane or aromatic ring, depending on the steric and electronic properties of the substrate. Alkane metathesis reactions are also highly selective, with the catalysts efficiently converting one alkane into another, often with the formation of isomers.

The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes are integral to achieving the desired product. σ-bond metathesis allows for the cleavage and reformation of alkene bonds, facilitating the exchange of hydrogen or deuterium atoms. Hydrogenolysis enables the removal of hydrogen atoms from the alkane or aromatic compound, contributing to the overall transformation. Chain walking describes the movement of the reaction front along the alkene chain, enhancing the efficiency of the alkane metathesis reaction.

In conclusion, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are powerful catalysts for C-H bond activation reactions, including H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Their unique surface coordination environments and supported metal centers contribute to the high reactivity, selectivity, and efficiency of these transformations, making them valuable tools in organic synthesis and materials science.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的性能，它们在H/D交换和烷烃重排反应中表现出显著的活性。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物通过σ键重排激活C-H键，导致H/D交换。锆中心能够催化C-H键的断裂和随后的脱氢过程，形成目标产物。另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在烷烃重排反应中表现高效，其活性中心的电负性和配位不饱和性驱动脱氢过程。这些催化剂能够使氢原子或脱氢原子与烷烃或芳香化合物进行交换，从而形成目标化合物。这两种过程的机制都涉及在支持金属中心的活化，随后是氢原子或脱氢原子的添加。

这些反应的速率取决于具体的催化剂体系、底物以及反应条件。高反应速率通常由于支持金属中心相对于其均相同系物提供的增强活性而实现。H/D交换的选择性通常很高，催化剂倾向于在特定位置向烷烃或芳香环引入脱氢原子，这依赖于底物的立体化学和电子性质。烷烃重排反应也具有高度选择性，催化剂高效地将一个烷烃转化为另一个，经常伴随着异构体的形成。

σ键重排、氢解离和链行走在这些过程中起着关键作用，促进了所需产物的生成。σ键重排允许烯键键的断裂和重组，从而实现氢或脱氢原子的交换。氢解离使烷烃或芳香化合物中的氢原子被移除，为整体转换提供了贡献。链行走描述了反应前沿沿烯键链的移动，增强了烷烃重排反应的效率。

综上所述，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物是C-H键激活反应的强大催化剂，包括H/D交换和烷烃重排。它们独特的表面配位环境和支持金属中心的特性促进了高度的反应性、选择性和效率，使它们成为有机合成和材料科学领域有价值的工具。
