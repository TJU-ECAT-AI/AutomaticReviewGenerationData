[1] "The un- 
derstanding of the unique surface coordination environments that give rise to such reactivity enhancements and the tailoring of these sites for more chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective catalysis is of fundamental scientific and technological importance."
[2] "Thus, 3/DA catalyzes the rapid polymerization of propene at room temperature to yield atactic (by 13C-NMR) polypropylene, catalyzes the rapid hydrogenation of propene in a plug-flow reactor (Nt> 25 8-l at 25C), and catalyzes the rapid hydrogenation of sterically hindered olefins (e.g., cyclohexene,1,3cyclohexadiene) in slurry reactions at room temperature."
[3] "In regard to the regiochemistry of Hz addition to benzene, 
13C 
and 13C{
H}
NMR spectra of the product C,H,D, indicate that each ( >95%) carbon is attached to a single H and a single D atom (Fig. la), and that more than one regioisomer is present (Fig. lb)."
[4] "The experiments relating to the hydrogenation of the benzene-p-xylene mixture are also informative about processes at the active site. The initial cat- alytic turnover frequency is indistinguishable from that for neat benzene, and the kinetics are essentially zero-order (Fig. 8)."
[5] "The straight lines show least-squares fit. to the data points in the two reaction regimes."
[6] "This result and other assays which detect Th-H/Th-hydrocarbyl functionalities (vide infra) sug- gest that the D,O poisoning process involves protonolytic interception of Th- H or Th-hydrocarbyl bonds."

Comparison and contrast between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties, are not explicitly detailed in the provided text. The document focuses on thorium hydrides specifically, providing details about their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in arene hydrogenation and alkane activation reactions. The mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are not extensively covered in the provided literature.
