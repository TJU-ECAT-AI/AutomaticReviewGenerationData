[1] "This new surface complex can readily be considered as an isolated atom of tantalum in an oxidation state of III stabilized by two siloxy (surface) and the hydride (external) ligands."
[2] "The turnover number is correlated with the number of carbon atoms of the cyclic alkanes, and therefore while cycloheptane is readily transformed, cyclopentane does not give any product (<1%)."
[3] "Under these conditions, cycloheptane is converted into a mixture of acyclic alkanes from methane to heptanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane."
[4] "The formation of smaller cyclic compounds must involve a carboncarbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carboncarbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction, while the formation of acyclic alkanes probably arises from the ring opening of the corresponding cyclic alkane."
[5] "The hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane is noteworthy since it forms a mixture of acyclic alkanes, cyclopentane and the ring-expansion product cyclohexane."
[6] "In the latter reaction, it has clearly been shown that the key step for carboncarbon bond cleavage was different from a β-alkyl transfer, in contrast to supported Group 4 metal hydrides."
[7] "It was reported that this reaction yielded the corresponding cycloalkyl complex (4 in the case of cycloheptane) with the formation of H2 (ca. 1 equiv)."
[8] "On the other hand, the 1H NMR spectrum displays a peak at δ=6.3 ppm, in agreement with the formation of small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbyl species."
[9] "These data are most consistent with the transformation of 13 into the cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2TaCp] (14)."
[10] "Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes)."

1. The surface complex [(SiO)2TaH] can be viewed as an isolated tantalum atom in an oxidation state of III, stabilized by two siloxy ligands and an external hydride ligand.
2. The catalytic activity of [(SiO)2TaH] is highly dependent on the number of carbon atoms in the cyclic alkane, with cycloheptane being efficiently transformed while cyclopentane yields no product.
3. [(SiO)2TaH] facilitates the hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes, converting them into a mixture of acyclic and cyclic alkanes, including cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane.
4. The hydrogenolysis process involves activation of carbon-carbon bonds, followed by rearrangement through ring expansion or contraction for the formation of smaller cyclic compounds, while acyclic alkanes result from the ring opening of cyclic alkanes.
5. Noteworthy is the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane, which produces a mixture of acyclic alkanes, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane as a ring-expansion product.
6. Unlike supported Group 4 metal hydrides, the key step for carbon-carbon bond cleavage in the presence of [(SiO)2TaH] is distinct, not involving β-alkyl transfer.
7. The reaction of cyclic alkanes with [(SiO)2TaH] yields corresponding cycloalkyl complexes, accompanied by the formation of molecular hydrogen.
8. The 1H NMR spectrum indicates the formation of small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbyl species after activation of cyclopentane with [(SiO)2TaH].
9. The solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopy confirm the transformation of the cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] into the cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)].
10. The hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes generates cyclopentane, which subsequently transforms into cyclopentadienyl species, rendering the catalyst inactive in hydrogenolysis processes.
