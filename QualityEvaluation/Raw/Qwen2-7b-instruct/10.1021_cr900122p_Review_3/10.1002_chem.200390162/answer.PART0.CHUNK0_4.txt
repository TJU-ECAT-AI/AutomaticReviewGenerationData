This literature focuses on the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on a tantalum hydride complex supported on silica, exploring the deactivation pathway through the combined use of 1D solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies. It discusses the catalytic ring contraction of cycloalkanes, the formation of the tantalum cyclopentadienyl derivative, and the correlation between the turnover number and the number of carbon atoms in the cyclic alkanes. It also examines the reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis and its transformation into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, which is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, explaining the fast deactivation and low conversion in the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes.

The study investigates the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex, observing catalytic ring contraction. The formation of the tantalum cyclopentadienyl derivative correlates with fast deactivation, which is linked to the evolution of the catalyst's active sites into inactive cyclopentadienyl derivatives. This explains the low conversion in the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes, contrasting with higher cycloalkanes that readily transform into lower and higher homologues.

研究探讨了硅基支持的钽氢化物复合材料上环烷烃的氢解反应，观察到催化环缩现象。形成钽环戊二烯衍生物与快速失活相关，这与催化剂活性位点转变为失活的环戊二烯基衍生物有关。这解释了环烷烃氢解时转化率低的原因，与更高环烷烃容易转化为更低和更高同系物形成对比。
