[1] "Most of the mechanisms involve an ensemble of adjacent metal atoms or preferably two metal centres in the carboncarbon bond-cleavage step, since such types of arrangements are readily found on metallic surfaces."
[2] "This new surface complex can readily be considered as an isolated atom of tantalum in an oxidation state of III stabilized by two siloxy (surface) and the hydride (external) ligands."
[3] "Under these conditions, cycloheptane is converted into a mixture of acyclic alkanes from methane to heptanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane."
[4] "In all cases the activity of the catalyst decreases rapidly, and after 20 h little or no conversion is observed, in agreement with deactivation of 1."
[5] "The percentage conversion varies as a function of the ring size of the starting alkane and its substituents as follows: cycloheptane > methylcyclohexane > cyclohexane > methylcyclopentane>cyclopentane."
[6] "The formation of smaller cyclic compounds must involve a carboncarbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carboncarbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction."
[7] "The formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of cycloheptane could occur either by subsequent hydrogenolysis of cyclohexane or directly by cleavage of a terminal ethyl group in place of the methyl group in 2."
[8] "While the former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer (Scheme 4: 313),22 it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products."
[9] "In the case of 1, a similar trend in ring size dependence was also observed (vide supra), yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides."
[10] "Moreover cyclopentane (0.1 equiv), cyclopentadiene (0.02 equiv), toluene (0.01 equiv) and methylcyclohexane (0.01 equiv) are also observed."
[11] "Despite their presence in small amounts, their formation is consistent with ring-opening/ring-closing metathesis pathways in which cyclohexene is transformed into cyclopentene and methylcyclohexene, which under the reaction conditions are transformed into cyclopentane, cyclopentadiene, methylcyclohexane and toluene (Scheme 5)."
[12] "These data are most consistent with the transformation of 13 into the cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2TaCp] (14)."
[13] "All the data are in agreement with the formation of [(SiO)2TaCp] (14)."
[14] "EXAFS on the sample prepared at room temperature is most consistent with about two oxygen neighbours located at 1.91 Å along with one carbon atom per Ta center at 2.03 Å."
[15] "These data are again fully consistent with 1) the formation of 13 from the activation of cyclopentane on 1, and 2) its evolution towards cyclopentadienyl derivative 14 at higher temperatures."

The literature focuses on the catalytic properties of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, particularly in the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes. The key differences between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions are not discussed in the provided text. However, the text does describe the catalytic behavior of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in detail:

1. The catalyst, [(SiO)2TaH], readily converts cycloalkanes into lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes under mild conditions. The mechanism involves ring contraction, possibly through carbene de-insertion or the activation of a carbon-carbon bond leading to a metallacyclobutane intermediate.

2. The rate of hydrogenolysis varies significantly with the size of the cycloalkane ring. Larger rings, such as cycloheptane, undergo hydrogenolysis more efficiently than smaller rings, such as cyclopentane.

3. The selectivity of the hydrogenolysis process is influenced by the substituents on the cycloalkane rings. Methyl groups, for instance, can influence the selectivity of the products generated.

4. The literature also discusses the formation of smaller cyclic compounds through a carbon-carbon activation step followed by rearrangement, either through ring expansion or contraction.

5. The role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in the C-H bond activation reactions is not explicitly detailed but is implied through the description of the mechanism involving the generation of metallacyclobutane intermediates and the subsequent ring contractions.

6. The text suggests that the mechanism for the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes differs from that of acyclic alkanes, as evidenced by the inability of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis under the same conditions as larger cycloalkanes like cycloheptane.

7. The literature provides evidence for the formation of a cyclopentadienyl derivative, [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)], through the activation and subsequent evolution of a cyclopentyl derivative, [(SiO)2TaC5H9], indicating a shift in reactivity towards less electrophilic surface complexes that do not catalyze the hydrogenolysis of alkanes.

8. The text also discusses the deactivation pathway of the catalyst, which is attributed to the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives, suggesting that the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes generates its own poison, which is responsible for the fast deactivation of the catalyst.

文献主要关注了二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物在环烷烃氢解反应中的催化性质。关于锆基氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的差异，文献中并未详细描述。然而，文献确实详细描述了二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的催化行为：

1. 催化剂[(SiO)2TaH]能够以温和条件高效地将环烷烃转化为较低的烷烃和环烷烃。机制可能涉及环收缩，通过碳碳键的活化形成金属环戊烷中间体。

2. 氢解速率随着环烷环大小的不同而显著变化。较大的环如环庚烷比较小的环如环戊烷更有效地进行氢解。

3. 氢解过程的选择性受到环烷环上取代基的影响。例如，甲基团可以影响生成产物的选择性。

4. 文献中描述了生成较小环化合物的过程，需要通过碳碳键激活步骤随后进行重排，既可以是环扩张也可以是环收缩。

5. σ-键的转移、氢解和链行走在C-H键激活反应中所起的作用没有明确阐述，但通过描述生成金属环戊烷中间体和随后的环收缩过程暗示了这一点。

6. 文献表明，环烷烃的氢解机制与非环烷烃不同，尤其是由于环戊烷在相同的条件下无法进行氢解，这与第四组过渡金属氢化物的反应模式有所不同。

7. 文献提供了形成环戊二烯衍生物[(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)]的证据，这是通过激活并随后演化为环戊基衍生物[(SiO)2TaC5H9]形成的，表明了活性位点向更不亲电的表面复合物转变，这些复合物不再催化烷烃的氢解。

8. 文献还讨论了催化剂的失活途径，归因于环戊二烯衍生物的形成，这表明环烷烃的氢解自动生成了催化剂自身的毒物，从而导致催化剂快速失活。

[1] "This new surface complex can readily be considered as an isolated atom of tantalum in an oxidation state of III stabilized by two siloxy (surface) and the hydride (external) ligands."
[2] "The turnover number is correlated with the number of carbon atoms of the cyclic alkanes, and therefore while cycloheptane is readily transformed, cyclopentane does not give any product (<1%)."
[3] "Under these conditions, cycloheptane is converted into a mixture of acyclic alkanes from methane to heptanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane."
[4] "The formation of smaller cyclic compounds must involve a carboncarbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carboncarbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction, while the formation of acyclic alkanes probably arises from the ring opening of the corresponding cyclic alkane."
[5] "The hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane is noteworthy since it forms a mixture of acyclic alkanes, cyclopentane and the ring-expansion product cyclohexane."
[6] "In the latter reaction, it has clearly been shown that the key step for carboncarbon bond cleavage was different from a β-alkyl transfer, in contrast to supported Group 4 metal hydrides."
[7] "It was reported that this reaction yielded the corresponding cycloalkyl complex (4 in the case of cycloheptane) with the formation of H2 (ca. 1 equiv)."
[8] "On the other hand, the 1H NMR spectrum displays a peak at δ=6.3 ppm, in agreement with the formation of small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbyl species."
[9] "These data are most consistent with the transformation of 13 into the cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2TaCp] (14)."
[10] "Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes)."

1. The surface complex [(SiO)2TaH] can be viewed as an isolated tantalum atom in an oxidation state of III, stabilized by two siloxy ligands and an external hydride ligand.
2. The catalytic activity of [(SiO)2TaH] is highly dependent on the number of carbon atoms in the cyclic alkane, with cycloheptane being efficiently transformed while cyclopentane yields no product.
3. [(SiO)2TaH] facilitates the hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes, converting them into a mixture of acyclic and cyclic alkanes, including cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane.
4. The hydrogenolysis process involves activation of carbon-carbon bonds, followed by rearrangement through ring expansion or contraction for the formation of smaller cyclic compounds, while acyclic alkanes result from the ring opening of cyclic alkanes.
5. Noteworthy is the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane, which produces a mixture of acyclic alkanes, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane as a ring-expansion product.
6. Unlike supported Group 4 metal hydrides, the key step for carbon-carbon bond cleavage in the presence of [(SiO)2TaH] is distinct, not involving β-alkyl transfer.
7. The reaction of cyclic alkanes with [(SiO)2TaH] yields corresponding cycloalkyl complexes, accompanied by the formation of molecular hydrogen.
8. The 1H NMR spectrum indicates the formation of small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbyl species after activation of cyclopentane with [(SiO)2TaH].
9. The solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopy confirm the transformation of the cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] into the cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)].
10. The hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes generates cyclopentane, which subsequently transforms into cyclopentadienyl species, rendering the catalyst inactive in hydrogenolysis processes.

This literature focuses on the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on a tantalum hydride complex supported on silica, exploring the deactivation pathway through the combined use of 1D solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies. It discusses the catalytic ring contraction of cycloalkanes, the formation of the tantalum cyclopentadienyl derivative, and the correlation between the turnover number and the number of carbon atoms in the cyclic alkanes. It also examines the reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis and its transformation into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, which is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, explaining the fast deactivation and low conversion in the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes.

The study investigates the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex, observing catalytic ring contraction. The formation of the tantalum cyclopentadienyl derivative correlates with fast deactivation, which is linked to the evolution of the catalyst's active sites into inactive cyclopentadienyl derivatives. This explains the low conversion in the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes, contrasting with higher cycloalkanes that readily transform into lower and higher homologues.
