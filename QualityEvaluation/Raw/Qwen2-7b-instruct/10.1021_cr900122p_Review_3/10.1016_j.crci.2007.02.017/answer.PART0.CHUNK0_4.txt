First, grafting of [Mo(NAr)(]CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (1-Me) on deuterated SiO2-(700) (75% deuterated) gives 1.0 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane, 75  5% monodeuterated.

Secondly, grafting of 1-Ph also gives 0.9 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane per grafted Mo, as observed for 1-Me.

Furthermore, the solid contains 7.27%wt C (27 C/Mo), in agreement with the formation of 2-Ph (expected 27 C/Mo).

Moreover, the 1H MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3a) displays the following signals: 11.4 (Mo]CH), 6.9 (aromatic CeH), 3.5 (CHMe2), 2.0 (CH2tBu) and 0.9 ppm (Me) (Table 1), while the 13C solid-state CP MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows signals at 153e122 (Ar), 56 (CH2tBu),48 (]CHC(CH3)3, 30 (CHMe2),29 (Me, tBu) and 22 ppm (CHMe2) (Table 1), in agreement with the structure 2-Ph (Scheme 4).

The preparation of silica-supported molybdenum imido alkyl alkylidene complexes involves grafting them onto the surface silanols of partially dehydroxylated silica (SiO2-(700)). This results in the formation of monosilyloxy derivatives, which exhibit reactivities similar to alcohols and phenols with pKa ≥ 9. These complexes are highly efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis reactions. The grafting mechanism occurs through electrophilic cleavage of the MoeC s-bond, leading to the formation of the monosilyloxy derivative. 

In the case of 1-Me, grafting onto deuterated SiO2-(700) results in the formation of 2-Me with a degree of deuteration of 93%. For 1-Ph, the formation of 2-Ph is observed with 0.9 equivalents of 2,2-dimethylpropane per grafted Mo. The solid-state NMR spectra confirm the structures of 2-Me and 2-Ph, with characteristic signals for the various functional groups involved.

These silica-supported complexes demonstrate enhanced reactivity and stability compared to their homogeneous equivalents, making them suitable for olefin metathesis reactions in a flow reactor. The catalysts display controlled selectivities, with ethylene (50%), E 2-butene (ca. 22%), Z 2-butene (ca. 28%), and minor amounts of 1-butene (0.3%) and 2-pentenes (0.06%) as the products.

在制备二氧化硅支持的钼烯丙基烷基二价金属化合物时，它们被嫁接到部分脱水的二氧化硅（SiO2-(700)）的表面硅醇基上。这导致形成单硅氧基衍生物，其活性与具有pKa≥9的醇和苯酚类似。这些化合物是烯烃裂合反应的有效催化剂。嫁接机制通过MoeC s键的亲电断裂发生，产生单硅氧基衍生物。

对于1-Me，在去氘化SiO2-(700)上的嫁接导致形成2-Me，其脱氘度为93%。对于1-Ph，观察到形成2-Ph，每嫁接的Mo有0.9当量的2,2-二甲基丙烷。固体核磁共振光谱证实了2-Me和2-Ph的结构，特征信号对应于涉及的各种官能团。

这些二氧化硅支持的复合物显示了与同质等效物相比增强的活性和稳定性，使其适合烯烃裂合反应。催化剂表现出可控的选择性，产品包括乙烯（50%），E 2-丁烯（约22%），Z 2-丁烯（约28%），以及少量的1-丁烯（0.3%）和2-戊烯（0.06%）。
