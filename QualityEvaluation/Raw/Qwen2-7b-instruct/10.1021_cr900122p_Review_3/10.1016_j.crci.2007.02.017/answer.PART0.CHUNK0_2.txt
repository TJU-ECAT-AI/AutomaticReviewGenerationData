[1] "First, grafting of [Mo(NAr)(]CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (1-Me) on deuterated SiO2-(700) (75% deuterated) gives 1.0 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane, 75  5% monodeuterated."
[2] "Upon grafting of 1*-Me on SiO2-(700), 0.9 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane,93  5% 13C mono-labelled was formed, which is consistent with a selective cleavage of the MoeC s-bond."
[3] "Grafting of 1-Ph also gives 0.9 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane per grafted Mo, as observed for 1-Me."
[4] "Whether starting from 2-Me and 2-Ph, similar initial rates (1 s1) are obtained, and SiO2-(700)"

The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions are not discussed in the provided literature. The literature focuses on silica-supported molybdenum imido alkyl alkylidene complexes and their grafting onto silica surfaces. It describes the preparation of these complexes on silica, the mechanism of grafting, and their use as catalysts in olefin metathesis reactions. However, it does not compare or contrast with zirconium or thorium hydride-based catalysts or provide details on their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided information.

对于二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质没有进行讨论。文献主要关注在二氧化硅表面上的钼基杂环烷基二烯基复合物的制备、接枝机制及其在烯烃环化反应中的应用。然而，它并没有与锆或钍化氢基催化剂进行比较或对比，也没有提供它们在氢/氘交换和烷烃环化方面的机制细节。因此，基于提供的信息，无法回答这个问题。
