<p>First, grafting of [Mo(NAr)(]CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (1-Me) on deuterated SiO2-(700) (75% deuterated) gives 1.0 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane, 75 ± 5% monodeuterated.</p>
<p>Secondly, grafting of 1-Ph also gives 0.9 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane per grafted Mo, as observed for 1-Me.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the solid contains 2.14%wt Mo (0.22 mmol/g), which is close to the maximum density: 0.26 mmol/g, consistent with what has been observed by IR spectroscopy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 1H MAS NMR spectrum displays the following signals: 11.4 (Mo]CH), 6.9 (aromatic CeH), 3.5 (CHMe2), 2.0 (CH2tBu) and 0.9 ppm (Me).</p>
<p>Notably, 2-Me and 2-Ph display very high activity in olefin metathesis. Whether starting from 2-Me and 2-Ph, similar initial rates (1 s1) are obtained.</p>

The silica-supported Mo imido alkyl alkylidene complexes undergo grafting reactions on the surface silanols of SiO2-(700) through the electrophilic cleavage of the MoeC s-bond, forming monosiloxy derivatives. This process is similar to the reaction with molecular silanol derivatives, showing reactivities akin to alcohols and phenols with pKa ≥ 9. The surface complex 2-R (R = Me or Ph) is found to be highly efficient in olefin metathesis catalysis. The grafting mechanism involves selective cleavage of the MoeC s-bond bond. The catalysts display reactivity and stability superior to their isoelectronic homogeneous equivalents, indicating the potential for developing well-defined heterogeneous catalysts through a structure-reactivity relationship. 

In a flow reactor, using 2-Me (49 mg, 2.1 %wt Mo, 1240 mol propene/mol Mo/min), the initial conversion (at 6 min) corresponds to a turnover frequency of 120 mol propene/mol Mo/min, with the productivity decreasing over time due to catalyst deactivation. After 1500 min, approximately 20,000 mol of propene per Mo have been transformed through metathesis.

The selectivities evolve with time and stabilize at approximately 50% ethylene, 22% E 2-butene, and 28% Z 2-butene, along with small amounts of 1-butene (0.3%) and 2-pentenes (0.06%). The E to Z 2-butenes ratio is 0.8, indicating slight Z selectivity. Using 2-Ph in place of 2-Me shows the same performance in a flow reactor, with similar initial rates, turnover numbers, and selectivities.

The catalysts were prepared using a multi-step process involving the synthesis of metal carbon single and double bonds, followed by treatment with triflic acid and Grignard reagents to introduce the neopentyl ligand. The grafting of the complexes onto SiO2-(700) resulted in the formation of monosiloxy derivatives, with the selective cleavage of the MoeC s-bond bond leading to the formation of the surface complex 2-R (R = Me or Ph).

The catalysts were characterized using various analytical techniques, including gas phase and liquid phase analyses, as well as solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the catalysts were highly active in olefin metathesis reactions, with the ability to produce a variety of olefins with high efficiency. The catalysts were also shown to have improved reactivity and stability compared to their homogeneous equivalents, suggesting potential for further development in heterogeneous catalysis.

In summary, the silica-supported Mo imido alkyl alkylidene complexes exhibit efficient grafting and olefin metathesis activities, demonstrating the potential for developing well-defined heterogeneous catalysts through a structure-reactivity relationship.

在SiO2-(700)表面硅醇基上的Mo imido alkyl alkylidene复合物通过MoeC s-键的亲电断裂进行接枝反应，形成单硅氧烷衍生物。这种过程类似于与分子硅醇衍生物的反应，显示出与pKa≥9的醇和苯酚相似的反应性。表面复合物2-R（R=Me或Ph）被发现是烯烃交叉偶联催化作用非常高效的催化剂。接枝机制涉及选择性断裂MoeC s-键。催化剂的活性和稳定性优于其等电荷的均相等价物，表明有可能通过结构-反应性关系开发定义明确的异质催化剂。

在流动反应器中，使用2-Me（49毫克，2.1％wt Mo，每摩尔Mo每分钟1240摩尔丙烯）时，在6分钟内初始转化率对应于每摩尔Mo每分钟120摩尔丙烯的周转频率，随着反应时间的推移，催化剂活性逐渐降低，主要是由于催化剂失活。1500分钟后，每摩尔Mo大约有20,000摩尔丙烯通过交叉偶联反应被转化。

选择性随着时间变化并稳定在约50%乙烯，22% E 2-丁烯和28% Z 2-丁烯，以及少量1-丁烯（0.3%）和2-戊烯（0.06%）。E到Z 2-丁烯的比例为0.8，表示轻微的Z选择性。使用2-Ph代替2-Me显示相同的性能在流动反应器中，具有相似的初始速率，周转数和选择性。

催化剂通过多步合成过程制备，涉及金属碳单键和双键的合成，随后用三氟乙酸和Grignard试剂引入二环戊基配体。向SiO2-(700)接枝复合物的结果导致形成单硅氧烷衍生物，通过选择性断裂MoeC s-键生成表面复合物2-R（R=Me或Ph）。

使用各种分析技术对催化剂进行了表征，包括气相和液相分析，以及固体状态核磁共振光谱。结果表明，催化剂在烯烃交叉偶联反应中具有高效率，能够产生多种烯烃。催化剂的活性和稳定性也比它们的均相等价物要好，这表明有可能进一步发展异质催化。

综上所述，SiO2-(700)支持的Mo imido alkyl alkylidene复合物表现出高效接枝和烯烃交叉偶联活性，表明有可能通过结构-反应性关系开发定义明确的异质催化剂。
