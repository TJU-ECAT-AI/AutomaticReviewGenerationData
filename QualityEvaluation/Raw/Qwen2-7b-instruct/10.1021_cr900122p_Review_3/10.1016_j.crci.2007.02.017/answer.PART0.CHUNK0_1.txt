1. The surface silanols on SiO2-(700) are capable of grafting Mo-based complexes in a manner that leads to the cleavage of the MeC bond through electrophilic cleavage, forming a new MeO bond. This process results in the formation of a new surface complex 2-R with similar reactivities to alcohols and phenols having a pKa greater than 9.

2. The grafting of Mo-based complexes onto the surface silanols of SiO2-(700) is selective, involving the cleavage of the MeC bond through electrophilic cleavage, which is consistent with the proposed pKa for the silanol, approximately 9. This method demonstrates the similar reactivities of surface and molecular silanols to alcohols and phenols with a pKa greater than 9.

3. The surface complex 2-R, derived from the grafting of Mo-based complexes onto the surface silanols of SiO2-(700), exhibits high efficiency as an olefin metathesis catalyst, particularly for substrates containing methyl groups (Me) or phenyl groups (Ph).

4. During the grafting process, one MeC bond is cleaved and one MeO bond is formed, indicating a transformation of the original complex structure.

5. Detailed studies on the reaction of Re-based complexes have revealed that simple electrophilic cleavage of the MeC bond through s-bond metathesis does not fully explain the isotopic labeling experiment.

6. When the neopentyl ligand of the Mo-based complex is selectively labeled with deuterium, the grafting process selectively cleaves the MeC bond, confirming the use of electrophilic cleavage.

7. The presence of surface or molecular silanols on the SiO2-(700) substrate is shown to have reactivities similar to alcohols and phenols with a pKa greater than 9, as evidenced by their ability to undergo direct reactions with the Mo-based complexes.

8. The catalyst 2-R, formed through the grafting of Mo-based complexes onto the surface silanols of SiO2-(700), is highly effective in olefin metathesis reactions, facilitating the conversion of various olefins into new products.

9. The process of grafting involves the cleavage of one MeC bond and the formation of one MeO bond, leading to structural changes in the Mo-based complex.

10. The absence of hydrogen transfer over a month in a 0.01 M C6D6 solution of the selectively labeled complex indicates the stability of the complex and the effectiveness of the grafting process.
