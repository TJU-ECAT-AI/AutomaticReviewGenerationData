Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, we find that both types of catalysts employ similar mechanisms. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are effective in H/D exchange reactions, showcasing their ability to selectively replace hydrogen atoms with deuterium in hydrocarbons. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides excel in alkane metathesis, demonstrating high activity and selectivity in rearranging alkane molecules through a series of chemical transformations. Both catalysts involve processes such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking to facilitate the activation of C-H bonds. These mechanisms enable the catalysts to efficiently participate in reactions such as H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, contributing to the broader field of organometallic chemistry and catalysis.
