Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation, the former shows higher reactivity due to the strong interaction with silica. They exhibit excellent selectivity in H/D exchange reactions, enabling efficient deuteration. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides have moderate reactivity and selectivity in alkane metathesis, facilitating alkane chain rearrangement. Both catalysts utilize mechanisms involving σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Reaction rates for zirconium hydrides are faster than those of thorium hydrides, while selectivity varies based on reaction conditions and substrate specificity.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活中的应用，前者由于与二氧化硅之间较强的相互作用而表现出更高的活性。它们在氢氘交换反应中显示出优异的选择性，能够高效地进行脱氢反应。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在烷烃裂合中的活性和选择性适中，促进烷烃链的重新排列。两种催化剂均利用σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走等机制。锆氢化物的反应速率比钍氢化物快，而选择性则根据反应条件和底物特异性而变化。
