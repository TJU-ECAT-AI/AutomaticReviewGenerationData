1. The discovery of Cp*2LuCH3 activating CH4 has been significant in finding catalysts for activating alkane bonds. 
2. The reaction transforming methyl complexes into metal hydrides has been identified.
3. The formation of lanthanide hydride complexes is found to be exothermic, matching experimental observations.
4. The addition of more lanthanide species tends to make the reaction more exothermic.
5. The activation energy for the process of bond metathesis decreases with increased hydridic character in the LnH bond, as previously shown.
6. Analytical frequency calculations confirmed the nature of the extrema in the system.
7. Considering the established findings and acknowledging limitations, Cl was selected as the exclusive ligand for subsequent calculations.
8. Forming ethane from Cl2LnCH3 is thermodynamically unfavourable, with an average energy difference of 11.3 kcal/mol for Cl and 5.7 kcal/mol for Cp.
9. The lanthanide's primary role in the transition state is stabilizing the negative charge on the anionic methyl groups.
10. The positive charge reduces the nucleophilicity of R, while a negative charge hinders stabilization of the strong negative charge in the [R    H    R] fragment, where R can be H or CH3.
