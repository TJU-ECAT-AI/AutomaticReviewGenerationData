[1] "The discovery that Cp*2LuCH3 (Cp* = C5Me5) activates CH4 (eqn. (1)) 1 has been a landmark in the search for new catalysts able to activate inert bonds especially those in alkanes."
[2] "Since no electrons are available on the lanthanide, the acti- vation of the CH bond must necessarily occur without change of oxidation state at the metal center."
[3] "The easily energetically accessible 4-c-transition state connects to separated Cp2LnH and H2.15"
[4] "Formation of the lanthanide hydride complex is calculated to be exothermic in agreement with experimental evidence."
[5] "Remarkably Cp*2LuH does not react with CH4 to exchange hydrogens (eqn. (3)) or to make Cp*2Lu Cp*2LnCH3  HCH3 Cp*2LnCH3  HCH3"
[6] "The nature of the extrema (minimum or transition structures, TS) was verified with analytical frequency calculations."

The research focuses on the activation of the C-H bond in methane (CH4) by lanthanide complexes. The study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the activation pathways, specifically the reactions of Cl2LnH with CH4 to form Cl2LnCH3 and H2, and the exchange of hydrogen between Cp*2LnH and CH4 to form Cp*2LnCH3 and H2. The calculations indicate that the formation of the lanthanide hydride complex is exothermic, supporting experimental findings. However, the complex Cp*2LuH does not undergo hydrogen exchange with CH4. The transition states for the activation processes are characterized by 4-center (4-c) transition states, which are energetically accessible, aligning with known experimental data. The geometry of the transition structures suggests a proton transfer between two anionic species, influenced by the lanthanide fragment.

研究集中在镧系元素复合物对甲烷（CH4）中C-H键的激活。研究使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来探索激活途径，特别是Cl2LnH与CH4反应生成Cl2LnCH3和H2，以及Cp*2LnH与CH4氢交换形成Cp*2LnCH3和H2的过程。计算表明镧系元素形成的氢化物复合物的形成是放热的，这与实验结果相符。然而，复合物Cp*2LuH不与CH4发生氢交换。激活过程的过渡态由4中心（4-c）过渡态表示，这些过渡态的能量可达，符合已知的实验数据。过渡结构的几何形状表明，两个阴离子物种之间存在质子转移，受到镧系碎片的影响。
