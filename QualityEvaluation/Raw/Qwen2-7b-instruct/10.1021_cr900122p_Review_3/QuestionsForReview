Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of Ïƒ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.
