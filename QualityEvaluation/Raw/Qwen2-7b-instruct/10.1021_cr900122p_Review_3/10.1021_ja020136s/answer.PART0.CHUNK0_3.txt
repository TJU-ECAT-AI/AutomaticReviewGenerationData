Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, we find that the former exhibit a more stable surface structure due to the higher dispersion of zirconium atoms on the silica support, leading to a different pattern of molecular organization in the latter. The preparation methods for these catalysts involve impregnation techniques. In terms of reactivity, silica-supported zirconium hydrides generally show faster reaction rates and higher selectivity than alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The mechanism of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which are essential in determining the reactivity of these catalysts.

比较二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，我们发现前者表面结构更加稳定，由于锆原子在二氧化硅支持上的更高分散性。后者表现出不同的分子组织模式，这影响了它们的活性。催化剂的制备方法涉及浸渍技术。在活性方面，二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物通常比氧化铝负载的钍氢化物显示更快的反应速率和更高的选择性。H/D交换和烷烃重排的机制涉及σ键重组、氢解和链行走，这些是确定这些催化剂活性的关键因素。
