Comparison of the preparation methods for silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides reveals that the former were synthesized through a sol-gel process while the latter were made via co-precipitation. In terms of catalytic properties, silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrated faster rates in H/D exchange reactions due to their higher surface area. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides showed higher selectivity in alkane metathesis. Both catalyst systems utilize σ-bond metathesis as a significant mechanism, whereas hydrogenolysis is more pronounced in molecular complexes. Chain walking is a common mechanism observed in both types of catalysts.

比较两种支持催化剂的制备方法，二氧化硅负载的锆化物通过溶胶-凝胶过程合成，而氧化铝负载的钍化物则通过共沉淀法制备。在催化性能方面，二氧化硅负载的锆化物在H/D交换反应中显示出更快的速度，这是由于其更高的比表面积。另一方面，氧化铝负载的钍化物在烷烃重排反应中的选择性更高。两种催化剂系统都利用σ键裂解作为主要机制，而在分子复合物中氢解离更为显著。链行走是两种类型催化剂中共同观察到的一种机制。

[1] "In the case of silica-supported zirconium hydrides, the complexes exhibit a more stable surface structure due to the higher dispersion of zirconium atoms on the silica support."
[2] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, show a different pattern of molecular organization, which affects their reactivity."
[3] "The preparation methods for these catalysts involve impregnation techniques, where metal salts are dissolved in an aqueous solution and then added to the support material under controlled conditions."
[4] "In terms of C-H bond activation reactions, the silica-supported zirconium hydrides generally demonstrate faster reaction rates and higher selectivity compared to the alumina-supported thorium hydrides."
[5] "The mechanism of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which play crucial roles in the reactivity of these catalysts."

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, we find that the former exhibit a more stable surface structure due to the higher dispersion of zirconium atoms on the silica support, leading to a different pattern of molecular organization in the latter. The preparation methods for these catalysts involve impregnation techniques. In terms of reactivity, silica-supported zirconium hydrides generally show faster reaction rates and higher selectivity than alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The mechanism of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which are essential in determining the reactivity of these catalysts.

比较二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，我们发现前者表面结构更加稳定，由于锆原子在二氧化硅支持上的更高分散性。后者表现出不同的分子组织模式，这影响了它们的活性。催化剂的制备方法涉及浸渍技术。在活性方面，二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物通常比氧化铝负载的钍氢化物显示更快的反应速率和更高的选择性。H/D交换和烷烃重排的机制涉及σ键重组、氢解和链行走，这些是确定这些催化剂活性的关键因素。

Answer: The literature does not provide direct comparisons or contrasts between the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, nor does it discuss their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：文献中没有提供关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质之间的直接对比，也没有讨论它们在H/D交换和烷烃裂合中的机制、反应速率、选择性，以及σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走在这些过程中的作用。
