Comparison of the preparation methods for silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides reveals that the former were synthesized through a sol-gel process while the latter were made via co-precipitation. In terms of catalytic properties, silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrated faster rates in H/D exchange reactions due to their higher surface area. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides showed higher selectivity in alkane metathesis. Both catalyst systems utilize σ-bond metathesis as a significant mechanism, whereas hydrogenolysis is more pronounced in molecular complexes. Chain walking is a common mechanism observed in both types of catalysts.

比较两种支持催化剂的制备方法，二氧化硅负载的锆化物通过溶胶-凝胶过程合成，而氧化铝负载的钍化物则通过共沉淀法制备。在催化性能方面，二氧化硅负载的锆化物在H/D交换反应中显示出更快的速度，这是由于其更高的比表面积。另一方面，氧化铝负载的钍化物在烷烃重排反应中的选择性更高。两种催化剂系统都利用σ键裂解作为主要机制，而在分子复合物中氢解离更为显著。链行走是两种类型催化剂中共同观察到的一种机制。
