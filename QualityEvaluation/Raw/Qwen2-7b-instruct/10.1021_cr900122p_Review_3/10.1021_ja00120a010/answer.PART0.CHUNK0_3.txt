[1] "The synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes is reported."
[2] "The reaction of Ta-( = CHC-(CH3)3)-(CH2C-(CH3)3)3 (1) with a silica dehydroxylated at 500 °C produces a mixture of (=SiO)Ta-( = CHC-(CH3)3)-(CH2C-(CH3)3)2 (2a) and (Si0)2Ta-( = CHC-(CH3)3)-(CH2C-(CH3)3) (2b) and neopentane gas (on average 1.3 equiv/equiv of tantalum)."
[3] "The reaction of 2d2b with acetone produces 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene per grafted tantalum, indicating that 2a,b each bear one carbene ligand."
[4] "When 1 is reacted with fully (>90%) deuterated silica, the product neopentane is only 38% monodeuterated."
[5] "The isotopomeric distribution in the volatile products of these reactions is traced to a mechanism of formation of 2a,b in which the first reaction of surface silanol with 1 is the addition of 0-H across the Ta=C double bond."

The study reports the synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes. These complexes were formed through the reaction of tantalum alkylidene complex 1 with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface, producing a mixture of 2a and 2b along with neopentane gas. The mechanism of formation involves the addition of surface silanol across the tantalum-carbon double bond of 1. The presence of neopentane indicates that each of the complexes 2a and 2b bears one carbene ligand. Detailed isotopomer analyses support this mechanism and provide insights into the incorporation of deuterium during the synthesis process.

本文报道了两种硅负载的五价钽碳烯配合物的合成。这些配合物通过1号钽烷基二烯体与部分脱水二氧化硅表面的反应产生，产生了2a和2b的混合物以及戊烷气体。形成机制涉及表面硅醇向1号中的双键添加。存在戊烷表明每个复合物2a和2b均含有一个碳烯配体。详细的同位素分析支持这一机制，并提供了在合成过程中掺入重氢的见解。
