[1] "The synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes is reported."
[2] "The reaction of Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]-[CH2C-(CH3)3]3 (1) with a silica dehydroxylated at 500 °C produces a mixture of (=SiO)Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- (CH2C-(CH3)3)2 (2a) and (Wi0)2Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- (CH2C-(CH3)3) (2b) and neopentane gas (on average 1.3 equiv/equiv of tantalum)."
[3] "When 1 is reacted with fully (>90%) deuterated silica, the product neopentane is only 38% monodeuterated."
[4] "The product of this reaction (2deut) is hydrolyzed with D2O to produce 2.6 equiv (per Ta) of neopentane as a mixture of neopentane-4, -dl, -d2, and -d3 (3.3:54.4:36.7:5.5)."
[5] "The volatile product of the reaction of 2 with acetone is 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene which is 15% monodeuterated."

The document describes the synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, specifically (SiO)xTa-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- (CH2C-(CH3)3)3-x (x = 1,2) (2). The synthesis involves reacting Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- [CH2C-(CH3)3]3 (1) with a dehydroxylated silica surface. This process results in the formation of neopentane gas and a mixture of 2a and 2b, where 2a contains one carbene ligand and 2b contains two. Additionally, the document provides details on the incorporation of deuterium into the tantalum surface complex during synthesis, evidenced by the isotopomer distribution in the volatile products of the reactions.

该文档描述了两种硅支持的钽(V)卡宾复合物的合成，具体为(SiO)xTa-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- (CH2C-(CH3)3)3-x(x=1,2)(2)。通过将Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- [CH2C-(CH3)3]3(1)与脱羟基硅表面反应来实现这一合成过程。这一过程导致生成丙戊酸气体和2a和2b的混合物，其中2a包含一个卡宾配体，而2b包含两个。此外，文档提供了在合成过程中将氘整合到钽表面复合物中的细节，这通过反应产物的同位素分布得以证明。
