The literature discusses the synthesis and characterization of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, namely (SiO)xTa(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C-(CH3)3)3-x (x = 1,2) (2). The reaction of the precursor Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]-[CH2C-(CH3)3]3 (1) with dehydroxylated silica yields these complexes along with neopentane gas. The complexes react with water to produce neopentane, and when synthesized with deuterated silica, they incorporate deuterium into the surface complex. The volatile products of the reactions with acetone include 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene, which shows some incorporation of deuterium in the carbenic positions.

文献讨论了两种硅支持的钽(V)碳烯络合物的合成和表征，即(SiO)xTa(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C-(CH3)3)3-x(x=1,2)(2)。将前体Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]-[CH2C-(CH3)3]3(1)与脱水硅胶反应产生这些络合物以及正戊烷气体。这些络合物与水反应产生正戊烷，当与去氘化硅胶合成时，它们在表面复合物中引入氘。反应的挥发性产物包括与乙酮反应后的2,4,4-三甲基-2-戊烯，显示部分碳烯位置包含氘。
