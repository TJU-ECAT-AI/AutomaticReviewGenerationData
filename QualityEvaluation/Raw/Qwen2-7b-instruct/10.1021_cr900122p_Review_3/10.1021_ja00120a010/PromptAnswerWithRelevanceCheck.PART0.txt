[1] "The synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes is reported."
[2] "The reaction of Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]-[CH2C-(CH3)3]3 (1) with a silica dehydroxylated at 500 °C produces a mixture of (=SiO)Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- (CH2C-(CH3)3)2 (2a) and (Wi0)2Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- (CH2C-(CH3)3) (2b) and neopentane gas (on average 1.3 equiv/equiv of tantalum)."
[3] "When 1 is reacted with fully (>90%) deuterated silica, the product neopentane is only 38% monodeuterated."
[4] "The product of this reaction (2deut) is hydrolyzed with D2O to produce 2.6 equiv (per Ta) of neopentane as a mixture of neopentane-4, -dl, -d2, and -d3 (3.3:54.4:36.7:5.5)."
[5] "The volatile product of the reaction of 2 with acetone is 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene which is 15% monodeuterated."

The document describes the synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, specifically (SiO)xTa-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- (CH2C-(CH3)3)3-x (x = 1,2) (2). The synthesis involves reacting Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]- [CH2C-(CH3)3]3 (1) with a dehydroxylated silica surface. This process results in the formation of neopentane gas and a mixture of 2a and 2b, where 2a contains one carbene ligand and 2b contains two. Additionally, the document provides details on the incorporation of deuterium into the tantalum surface complex during synthesis, evidenced by the isotopomer distribution in the volatile products of the reactions.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons or discussions on the preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It focuses specifically on the synthesis and characterization of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, their reactions with deuterated silica surfaces, and the incorporation of deuterium in the complexes during synthesis. Therefore, no relevant information is provided to address the comparison of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

The literature discusses the synthesis and characterization of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, specifically (SiO)xTa-(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)x (x = 1,2) (2). The reaction of 1 with a dehydroxylated silica surface produces a mixture of 2a and 2b along with neopentane gas. These complexes react differently with water and acetone, showing the presence of carbene ligands and providing insights into their structure and catalytic properties. The isotopomeric distribution of reaction products suggests the mechanism of formation involves the addition of surface silanol across the tantalum-carbon double bond of 1, leading to a tetraalkyl tantalum siloxide intermediate and subsequent elimination of neopentane through a-hydride transfer to form carbene complexes. The incorporation of deuterium during synthesis and its distribution in the volatile products offer further details on the synthesis process and the nature of the complexes.

The study reports the synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes. These complexes were formed through the reaction of tantalum alkylidene complex 1 with a partially dehydroxylated silica surface, producing a mixture of 2a and 2b along with neopentane gas. The mechanism of formation involves the addition of surface silanol across the tantalum-carbon double bond of 1. The presence of neopentane indicates that each of the complexes 2a and 2b bears one carbene ligand. Detailed isotopomer analyses support this mechanism and provide insights into the incorporation of deuterium during the synthesis process.

The literature discusses the synthesis and characterization of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, namely (SiO)xTa(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C-(CH3)3)3-x (x = 1,2) (2). The reaction of the precursor Ta-[=CHC-(CH3)3]-[CH2C-(CH3)3]3 (1) with dehydroxylated silica yields these complexes along with neopentane gas. The complexes react with water to produce neopentane, and when synthesized with deuterated silica, they incorporate deuterium into the surface complex. The volatile products of the reactions with acetone include 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene, which shows some incorporation of deuterium in the carbenic positions.
