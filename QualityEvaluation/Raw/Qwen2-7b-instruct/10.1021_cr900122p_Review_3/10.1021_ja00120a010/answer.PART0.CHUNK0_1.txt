[1] "The synthesis of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes is reported."
[2] "The reaction of Ta-[=CHC(CH3)3]-[CH2C(CH3)3]3 (1) with a silica dehydroxylated at 500 °C produces a mixture of (=SiO)Ta(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)2 (2a) and (Si0)2Ta(=CHC(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3) (2b) and neopentane gas (on average 1.3 equiv/equiv of tantalum)."
[3] "The reaction of 2d2b with water produces 2.6 mol of neopentane."
[4] "The reaction of 2d2b with acetone produces 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene per grafted tantalum, indicating that 2a,b each bear one carbene ligand."
[5] "When 1 is reacted with fully (>90%) deuterated silica, the product neopentane is only 38% monodeuterated."
[6] "The volatile product of the reaction of 1 with acetone is 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene which is 15% monodeuterated, demonstrating some incorporation of deuterium in the carbenic positions of Ta."

The literature does not provide direct comparisons or discussions on the preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It focuses specifically on the synthesis and characterization of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, their reactions with deuterated silica surfaces, and the incorporation of deuterium in the complexes during synthesis. Therefore, no relevant information is provided to address the comparison of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

文献没有提供关于二氧化硅支持的锆化物氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的直接比较、结构、催化性质或机制。它专注于合成和表征两种二氧化硅支持的钽(V)碳烯络合物，它们与去氘化二氧化硅表面的反应以及合成过程中在络合物中掺入氘的信息。因此，没有相关的信息来回答二氧化硅支持的锆化物氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物氢化物的比较。
