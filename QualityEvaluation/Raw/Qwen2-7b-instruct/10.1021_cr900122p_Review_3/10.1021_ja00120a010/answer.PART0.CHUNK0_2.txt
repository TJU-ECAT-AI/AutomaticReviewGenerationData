[2] "The reaction of Ta-(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)3(1) with a silica dehydroxylated at 500 °C produces a mixture of (=SiO)Ta-(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)2(2a) and (SiO)2Ta-(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)(2b) and neopentane gas (on average 1.3 equiv/equiv of tantalum)."

[4] "The reaction of 2d2b with acetone produces 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene per grafted tantalum, indicating that 2a,b each bear one carbene ligand."
[5] "When 1 is reacted with fully (>90%) deuterated silica, the product neopentane is only 38% monodeuterated."
[6] "The presence of neopentane-d3 is evidence for the incorporation of deuterium into the tantalum surface complex during the synthesis of 2d2b."
[7] "The volatile product of the reaction of 2d2b with acetone is 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene which is 15% monodeuterated, demonstrating some incorporation of deuterium in the carbenic positions of Ta."

The literature discusses the synthesis and characterization of two silica-supported tantalum(V) carbene complexes, specifically (SiO)xTa-(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)x (x = 1,2) (2). The reaction of 1 with a dehydroxylated silica surface produces a mixture of 2a and 2b along with neopentane gas. These complexes react differently with water and acetone, showing the presence of carbene ligands and providing insights into their structure and catalytic properties. The isotopomeric distribution of reaction products suggests the mechanism of formation involves the addition of surface silanol across the tantalum-carbon double bond of 1, leading to a tetraalkyl tantalum siloxide intermediate and subsequent elimination of neopentane through a-hydride transfer to form carbene complexes. The incorporation of deuterium during synthesis and its distribution in the volatile products offer further details on the synthesis process and the nature of the complexes.

文献讨论了两种硅基支持的钽(V)卡宾络合物的合成和表征，具体为(SiO)xTa-(=CHC-(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)x(x = 1,2)（2）。通过与去羟基化硅表面反应，产生2a和2b的混合物以及正戊烷气体。这些络合物与水和乙酮的反应显示了卡宾配体的存在，并提供了它们的结构和催化性质的见解。反应产物的同位素分布表明，形成机制涉及表面硅醇向1中的双键添加，生成四烷基钽硅氧烷中间体，随后通过a-氢转移除去正戊烷，形成卡宾络合物。合成过程中氘的掺入及其在挥发性产物中的分布进一步揭示了合成过程的细节和络合物的性质。
