2.1. "In order to prepare various oxide-supported tungsten and tantalum hydrides affording comparison in catalytic properties, tungsten neopentyl-neopentylidyne [W( CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] 2 [19] was grafted on silica-(700) [22] and c-alumina-(500) [23] previously treated under vacuum at 700 and 500 C, respectively."
2.2. "Similarly, tantalum neopentyl-neopentylidene [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2 tBu)3] 3 [20] was supported on c-alumina-(500)."
2.3. "The treatment under hydrogen of the tantalum complex [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] grafted on c-alumina-(500) (solid 6) led to the almost complete consumption of the m(CH) and d(CH) bands, a partial consumption of the m(OH) bands and the appearance of two bands at 1830 cm)1 and 1930 cm)1 corresponding,respectively, to m(TaH) and m(AlH) vibration modes."
2.4. "In the case of alumina, the thermal treatment under H2 of complex [(AlO)W(  CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] 5 led to a partial consumption of remaining OH, the total con- sumption of m(CH) and d(CH) bands and the appear- ance of two bands at 1804 and 1903 cm)1 (figure 3d),which can be assigned to the m(WH) vibration modes of a [W]H/Al2O3 8."
2.5. "In the case of ethane, mechanistic or kinetic aspects can be envisaged in particular concerning the difficulty to dehydrogenate ethane into ethylene."

Silica and alumina supported tungsten and tantalum hydrides were compared in alkane metathesis. Tungsten hydrides, represented by [W]H/Al2O3, showed superior efficiency in propane metathesis compared to tantalum hydrides, [Ta]H/SiO2. This catalyst also provided a narrower distribution in product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products. [W]H/Al2O3 was also more effective than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis, though it performed less well with ethane. In contrast, [Ta]H/SiO2 had higher initial activity and lower deactivation. Tungsten, being a standard olefin metathesis catalyst, demonstrated better performance than tantalum in alkane metathesis. The difficulties in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene were attributed to kinetic or mechanistic factors in tungsten-based catalysts.

在烷烃裂合反应中，二氧化硅和氧化铝支持的钨和钽氢化物进行了比较。钨氢化物[W]H/Al2O3在丙烷裂合反应中的效率比钽氢化物[Ta]H/SiO2高。这种催化剂还提供了产品选择性的更窄分布，并且线性产物的量更高。[W]H/Al2O3对于丁烷裂合也优于[Ta]H/SiO2，尽管它在乙烷裂合中的表现较差。相比之下，[Ta]H/SiO2具有更高的初始活性和较低的失活。作为标准的烯烃裂合催化剂，钨在烷烃裂合中的性能优于钽。钨催化剂在乙烷裂解时难以转化为乙烯的原因可能与动力学或机制因素有关。
