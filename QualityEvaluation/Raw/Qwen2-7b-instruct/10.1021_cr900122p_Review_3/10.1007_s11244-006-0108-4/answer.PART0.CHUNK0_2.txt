Silica and alumina supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides were tested in alkane metathesis, for comparison of their catalytic properties. In propane metathesis [W]H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more efficient than the usual [Ta]H/SiO2 catalyst which is still better than [Ta]H/Al2O3 and [W]H/SiO2. Tungsten based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and to a higher amount of linear products than [Ta]H/SiO2. [W]H/Al2O3 is also a better catalyst than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis but is less efficient with ethane.
Whereas the results in the case of propane or butane can involve the higher initial activity and a lower deactivation of the tungsten catalyst, in the case of ethane, mechanistic or kinetic aspects can be envisaged in particular concerning the difficulty to dehydrogenate ethane into ethylene.

The document compares the catalytic properties of silica-supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides, and alumina-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis. In propane metathesis, tungsten hydrides on alumina ([W]H/Al2O3) are found to be twice more efficient than silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([Ta]H/SiO2). Tungsten-based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and produce a higher amount of linear products compared to tantalum-based catalysts on silica ([Ta]H/SiO2). For butane metathesis, tungsten hydrides on alumina ([W]H/Al2O3) are superior to tantalum hydrides on silica ([Ta]H/SiO2). However, tungsten hydrides on alumina are less efficient in ethane metathesis compared to tantalum hydrides on silica. The efficiency differences in ethane metathesis can be attributed to mechanistic or kinetic aspects, particularly the difficulty in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

文档比较了硅酸盐支持的钽和钨氢化物以及氧化铝支持的钽氢化物在烷烃裂合中的催化性质。在丙烷裂合中，铝氧化物上的钨氢化物([W]H/Al2O3)比硅酸盐支持的钽氢化物([Ta]H/SiO2)更高效两倍。钨基催化剂产生的产品选择性分布更窄，并且产生更多的线性产品，与硅酸盐上的钽催化剂([Ta]H/SiO2)相比。对于丁烷裂合，铝氧化物上的钨氢化物([W]H/Al2O3)优于硅酸盐上的钽氢化物([Ta]H/SiO2)。然而，在乙烷裂合中，铝氧化物上的钨氢化物效率低于硅酸盐上的钽氢化物。在乙烷裂合中的效率差异可以归因于机制或动力学方面，特别是脱氢化乙烷为乙烯的困难。
