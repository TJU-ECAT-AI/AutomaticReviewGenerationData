Silica and alumina supported tungsten hydrides demonstrated superior catalytic properties compared to tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis reactions. Specifically, tungsten hydrides supported on alumina (W/H/Al2O3) were found to be more efficient than tantalum hydrides supported on silica ([Ta]H/SiO2), and even outperformed tungsten hydrides supported on silica (W/H/SiO2) and tantalum hydrides supported on alumina ([Ta]H/Al2O3). The alumina-supported tungsten catalysts showed a narrower distribution in the products' selectivity and produced a higher amount of linear products compared to the silica-supported tantalum catalysts. Additionally, W/H/Al2O3 was found to be a better catalyst than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis but performed less efficiently with ethane. The enhanced performance of W/H/Al2O3 in propane and butane metathesis was attributed to its superior initial activity and reduced deactivation rate compared to [Ta]H/SiO2. However, the results for ethane indicated a less efficient performance of W/H/Al2O3 compared to [Ta]H/SiO2, possibly due to mechanistic or kinetic factors related to the difficulty of dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

在烷烃裂合反应中，二氧化硅和氧化铝支持的钨氢化物表现出与钽氢化物相比更优越的催化性能。具体而言，氧化铝支持的钨催化剂（W/H/Al2O3）的效率高于二氧化硅支持的钽催化剂（[Ta]H/SiO2），甚至优于氧化铝支持的钨催化剂（W/H/SiO2）和二氧化硅支持的钽催化剂（[Ta]H/Al2O3）。氧化铝支持的钨催化剂显示出产品选择性分布更窄，并且产生更多线性产物，与二氧化硅支持的钽催化剂相比。此外，W/H/Al2O3被发现是比[Ta]H/SiO2更好的催化剂用于丁烷裂合，但在乙烷裂合中的表现较差。W/H/Al2O3在丙烷和丁烷裂合中的增强性能归因于其更高的初始活性和较低的失活速率与[Ta]H/SiO2相比。然而，对于乙烷的结果表明，W/H/Al2O3的性能较[Ta]H/SiO2差，这可能与脱氢乙烷为乙烯的机制或动力学因素有关。

The document compares the catalytic properties of silica-supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides, and alumina-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis. In propane metathesis, tungsten hydrides on alumina ([W]H/Al2O3) are found to be twice more efficient than silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([Ta]H/SiO2). Tungsten-based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and produce a higher amount of linear products compared to tantalum-based catalysts on silica ([Ta]H/SiO2). For butane metathesis, tungsten hydrides on alumina ([W]H/Al2O3) are superior to tantalum hydrides on silica ([Ta]H/SiO2). However, tungsten hydrides on alumina are less efficient in ethane metathesis compared to tantalum hydrides on silica. The efficiency differences in ethane metathesis can be attributed to mechanistic or kinetic aspects, particularly the difficulty in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

文档比较了硅酸盐支持的钽和钨氢化物以及氧化铝支持的钽氢化物在烷烃裂合中的催化性质。在丙烷裂合中，铝氧化物上的钨氢化物([W]H/Al2O3)比硅酸盐支持的钽氢化物([Ta]H/SiO2)更高效两倍。钨基催化剂产生的产品选择性分布更窄，并且产生更多的线性产品，与硅酸盐上的钽催化剂([Ta]H/SiO2)相比。对于丁烷裂合，铝氧化物上的钨氢化物([W]H/Al2O3)优于硅酸盐上的钽氢化物([Ta]H/SiO2)。然而，在乙烷裂合中，铝氧化物上的钨氢化物效率低于硅酸盐上的钽氢化物。在乙烷裂合中的效率差异可以归因于机制或动力学方面，特别是脱氢化乙烷为乙烯的困难。

2.1. "In order to prepare various oxide-supported tungsten and tantalum hydrides affording comparison in catalytic properties, tungsten neopentyl-neopentylidyne [W( CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] 2 [19] was grafted on silica-(700) [22] and c-alumina-(500) [23] previously treated under vacuum at 700 and 500 C, respectively."
2.2. "Similarly, tantalum neopentyl-neopentylidene [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2 tBu)3] 3 [20] was supported on c-alumina-(500)."
2.3. "The treatment under hydrogen of the tantalum complex [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] grafted on c-alumina-(500) (solid 6) led to the almost complete consumption of the m(CH) and d(CH) bands, a partial consumption of the m(OH) bands and the appearance of two bands at 1830 cm)1 and 1930 cm)1 corresponding,respectively, to m(TaH) and m(AlH) vibration modes."
2.4. "In the case of alumina, the thermal treatment under H2 of complex [(AlO)W(  CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] 5 led to a partial consumption of remaining OH, the total con- sumption of m(CH) and d(CH) bands and the appear- ance of two bands at 1804 and 1903 cm)1 (figure 3d),which can be assigned to the m(WH) vibration modes of a [W]H/Al2O3 8."

Silica and alumina supported tungsten and tantalum hydrides were compared in alkane metathesis. Tungsten hydrides, represented by [W]H/Al2O3, showed superior efficiency in propane metathesis compared to tantalum hydrides, [Ta]H/SiO2. This catalyst also provided a narrower distribution in product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products. [W]H/Al2O3 was also more effective than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis, though it performed less well with ethane. In contrast, [Ta]H/SiO2 had higher initial activity and lower deactivation. Tungsten, being a standard olefin metathesis catalyst, demonstrated better performance than tantalum in alkane metathesis. The difficulties in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene were attributed to kinetic or mechanistic factors in tungsten-based catalysts.

Answer: 
The document compares the efficiency of silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([Ta]H/SiO2) and alumina-supported tungsten hydrides ([W]H/Al2O3) in alkane metathesis reactions. It states that [W]H/Al2O3 is twice more efficient than [Ta]H/SiO2. Tungsten-based catalysts yield a narrower distribution of product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products compared to tantalum-based catalysts. Furthermore, [W]H/Al2O3 performs better than [Ta]H/SiO2 in butane metathesis but is less efficient with ethane. In propane metathesis, [W]H/Al2O3 is found to be significantly more efficient than [Ta]H/SiO2.
