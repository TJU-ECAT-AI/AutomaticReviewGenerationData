Silica and alumina supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides were tested in alkane metathesis, for comparison of their catalytic properties.
[W]H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more efficient than the usual [Ta]H/SiO2 catalyst which is still better than [Ta]H/Al2O3 and [W]H/SiO2.
Tungsten based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and to a higher amount of linear products than [Ta]H/SiO2.
[W]H/Al2O3 is also a better catalyst than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis but is less efficient with ethane.
In propane metathesis [W]H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more efficient than the usual [Ta]H/SiO2 catalyst which is still better than [Ta]H/Al2O3 and [W]H/SiO2.

Answer: 
The document compares the efficiency of silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([Ta]H/SiO2) and alumina-supported tungsten hydrides ([W]H/Al2O3) in alkane metathesis reactions. It states that [W]H/Al2O3 is twice more efficient than [Ta]H/SiO2. Tungsten-based catalysts yield a narrower distribution of product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products compared to tantalum-based catalysts. Furthermore, [W]H/Al2O3 performs better than [Ta]H/SiO2 in butane metathesis but is less efficient with ethane. In propane metathesis, [W]H/Al2O3 is found to be significantly more efficient than [Ta]H/SiO2.

文档比较了氧化硅支持的钽氢化物（[Ta]H/SiO2）和氧化铝支持的钨氢化物（[W]H/Al2O3）在烷烃裂合反应中的催化性能。它指出，[W]H/Al2O3比[Ta]H/SiO2更有效率两倍。钨基催化剂的产物选择性分布更窄，线性产物量更高，与钽基催化剂相比。此外，在丁烷裂合中，[W]H/Al2O3优于[Ta]H/SiO2，但在乙烷中效率较低。在丙烷裂合中，[W]H/Al2O3比[Ta]H/SiO2显著更有效。
