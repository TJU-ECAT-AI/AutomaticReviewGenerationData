Silica and alumina supported tungsten hydrides demonstrated superior catalytic properties compared to tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis reactions. Specifically, tungsten hydrides supported on alumina (W/H/Al2O3) were found to be more efficient than tantalum hydrides supported on silica ([Ta]H/SiO2), and even outperformed tungsten hydrides supported on silica (W/H/SiO2) and tantalum hydrides supported on alumina ([Ta]H/Al2O3). The alumina-supported tungsten catalysts showed a narrower distribution in the products' selectivity and produced a higher amount of linear products compared to the silica-supported tantalum catalysts. Additionally, W/H/Al2O3 was found to be a better catalyst than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis but performed less efficiently with ethane. The enhanced performance of W/H/Al2O3 in propane and butane metathesis was attributed to its superior initial activity and reduced deactivation rate compared to [Ta]H/SiO2. However, the results for ethane indicated a less efficient performance of W/H/Al2O3 compared to [Ta]H/SiO2, possibly due to mechanistic or kinetic factors related to the difficulty of dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

在烷烃裂合反应中，二氧化硅和氧化铝支持的钨氢化物表现出与钽氢化物相比更优越的催化性能。具体而言，氧化铝支持的钨催化剂（W/H/Al2O3）的效率高于二氧化硅支持的钽催化剂（[Ta]H/SiO2），甚至优于氧化铝支持的钨催化剂（W/H/SiO2）和二氧化硅支持的钽催化剂（[Ta]H/Al2O3）。氧化铝支持的钨催化剂显示出产品选择性分布更窄，并且产生更多线性产物，与二氧化硅支持的钽催化剂相比。此外，W/H/Al2O3被发现是比[Ta]H/SiO2更好的催化剂用于丁烷裂合，但在乙烷裂合中的表现较差。W/H/Al2O3在丙烷和丁烷裂合中的增强性能归因于其更高的初始活性和较低的失活速率与[Ta]H/SiO2相比。然而，对于乙烷的结果表明，W/H/Al2O3的性能较[Ta]H/SiO2差，这可能与脱氢乙烷为乙烯的机制或动力学因素有关。
