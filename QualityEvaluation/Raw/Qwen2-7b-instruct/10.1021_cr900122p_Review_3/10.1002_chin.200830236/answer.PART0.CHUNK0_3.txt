</quotes>

The provided literature does not contain specific details regarding the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, nor does it discuss their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, I am unable to compare and contrast these catalysts based on the information available in this document.
