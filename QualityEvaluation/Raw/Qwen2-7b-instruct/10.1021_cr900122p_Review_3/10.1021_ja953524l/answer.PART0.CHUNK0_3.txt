Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the silica-supported tantalum hydride (3) exhibits reactivity similar to early transition metal hydrides. Its preparation involves heating neopentyl or neopentylidene complexes under hydrogen to form a surface tantalum(III) monohydride and SiH groups. The structure of 3 includes two σ-bonded surface SiO groups attached to tantalum, with a weak interaction from a third surface oxygen, possibly siloxane. This weak interaction complements the high oxophilicity of tantalum.

The catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions depend on the specific mechanisms involved. The zirconium hydride might show different reactivity patterns compared to the tantalum hydride due to differences in the metal's electronic and coordinative properties. The alumina-supported thorium hydride could exhibit distinct behavior based on the support's influence on the hydride's stability and reactivity.

In H/D exchange, the silica-supported tantalum hydride facilitates the exchange process due to its hydride functionality. The exchange reaction with deuterium leads to a reversible process, indicating the presence of a tantalum hydride. The alkane metathesis process involves the activation of alkane's C-H bonds by the surface hydride, followed by the rearrangement of alkane fragments, leading to the formation of new alkyl groups.

The rates of these reactions might vary depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of additional reagents. Selectivity in C-H bond activation reactions could be influenced by the specific conditions and the nature of the alkane substrate. The mechanisms of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking play crucial roles in these processes, affecting the outcome of the reactions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydride's ability to activate the CH bond of cycloalkanes at room temperature to form the corresponding surface tantalum(III) monoalkyls with liberation of hydrogen indicates its catalytic potential in alkane activation. The role of the hydride in these reactions is essential for the activation of the C-H bond and the subsequent formation of new alkyl groups.

The alumina-supported thorium hydride might show different catalytic properties due to the support's influence on the thorium hydride's stability and reactivity. The support could affect the hydride's reactivity and the overall catalytic performance in alkane activation reactions. The specific mechanisms involved in the activation of C-H bonds by the alumina-supported thorium hydride might differ from those observed with the silica-supported tantalum hydride.
