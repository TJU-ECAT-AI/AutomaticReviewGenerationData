[1] "The reaction of SiO-Ta[CH2C(CH3)3]2[CHC(CH3)3] (2a) and (SiO)2Ta[CH2C(CH3)3][CHC(CH3)3] (2b) with hydrogen up to 200 C affords the predominant formation of a surface tantalum(III) monohydride (SiO)2TaIIIH (3) and of SiH groups."
[2] "When 3 is treated with a vapor of CH3I (400 Torr; 25 C), the silica disc rapidly turns from brown to white; simultaneously, the IR bands in the 1800 cm-1 region completely disappear, and methane is evolved in the gas phase."
[3] "The presence of an oxygen shell at 2.63 Å does indeed suggest that a third surface oxygen atom is interacting weakly with the tantalum."
[4] "The substitution of neopentyl and neopentylidene groups by hydride in complexes 2a and 2b proceeds at as low a temperature as 25 C in contrast to SiOZrNp3 for which heating to 70 C at least is required."

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions reveals distinct characteristics. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions that are characterized by specific mechanisms involving σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The silica-supported tantalum hydride (3) forms under mild conditions (25°C) compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides, which require higher temperatures (70°C or more) for the analogous reactions. The structure of the silica-supported tantalum hydride is characterized by two σ-bonded surface SiO groups and a third weakly interacting surface oxygen, contributing to its unique catalytic properties. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides, on the other hand, might show different reaction rates and selectivities based on the distinct coordination geometry and electronic properties of zirconium compared to tantalum. The alumina-supported thorium hydrides could display different reaction dynamics and catalytic efficiencies due to the different support material and metal properties, potentially affecting the stability and reactivity of the surface species. 

In summary, while all three systems (silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, and silica-supported tantalum hydride 3) facilitate C-H bond activation, they differ in the preparation conditions, structural features, and catalytic mechanisms involved. The silica-supported tantalum hydride stands out with its mild preparation conditions and unique structural attributes, offering insights into the development of efficient catalysts for C-H bond activation reactions.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质揭示了不同的特性。二氧化硅支持的锆化氢的H/D交换和烷烃异构化反应具有特定的机制，涉及σ键异构化、氢解离和链行走。二氧化硅支持的钽化氢（3）在较低温度（25°C）下形成，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢则需要至少70°C的较高温度进行类似的反应。二氧化硅支持的钽化氢的结构由两个σ键连接的表面SiO组分和一个与钽中心弱相互作用的第三表面氧组成，这赋予了其独特的催化性能。相比之下，二氧化硅支持的锆化氢可能基于锆的特定配位几何和电子性质表现出不同的反应速率和选择性。氧化铝支持的钍化氢由于不同的支持材料和金属性质，可能会影响表面物种的稳定性和活性，从而影响催化效率。简而言之，尽管所有三个系统（二氧化硅支持的锆化氢、氧化铝支持的钍化氢和二氧化硅支持的钽化氢3）都促进C-H键活化，但它们在准备条件、结构特征和催化机制方面存在差异。二氧化硅支持的钽化氢因其温和的制备条件和独特的结构特点，为高效催化剂的发展提供了见解。
