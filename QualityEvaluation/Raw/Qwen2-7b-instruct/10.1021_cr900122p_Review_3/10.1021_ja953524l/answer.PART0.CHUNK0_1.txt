The silica-supported tantalum complexes were prepared by reacting Ta[CH2C(CH3)3]3 [CHC(CH3)3]3 (1) with the silanol groups of a silica previously dehydroxylated at 500°C. Upon treatment under 1 atm of hydrogen up to 200°C, a surface tantalum(III) monohydride (SiO)2TaIIIH (3) was formed as the major product along with surface SiH groups. The surface tantalum complexes exhibited reactivity similar to early transition metal hydrides. The formation of the SiH groups was supported by a mechanism involving the transfer of a hydride from the tantalum(III) dihydride SiOTaH2, which originated from 2a, to a neighboring siloxane bridge, resulting in the formation of the SiH groups and bonding of a second SiO group to tantalum.

这些二氧化硅支持的钽复合物通过将Ta[CH2C(CH3)3]3 [CHC(CH3)3]3（1）与先前在500°C脱水的二氧化硅的硅醇基团反应制备。在1大气压氢气下加热至200°C后，形成了表面钽(III)单氢化物（SiO）2TaIIIH（3）作为主要产物，以及表面SiH基团。这些表面钽复合物的反应性类似于早期过渡金属氢化物。SiH基团的形成得到了机制的支持，该机制涉及从源自2a的Ta(III)二氢化物SiOTaH2向相邻的硅氧烷桥的氢转移，从而形成了SiH基团并使第二个SiO基团与钽结合。

The surface organometallic complexes were immobilized on solid surfaces, including oxides, zeolites, or metals, to create highly selective heterogeneous catalysts with well-defined surface species. The trisneopentyl(neopentylidene)tantalum complex (1) reacted with the silanol groups of a silica dehydroxylated at 500°C, forming two surface carbene species: SiOTa[CH2C(CH3)3]2[CHC(CH3)3] (2a) (65±5%) and (SiO)2Ta[CH2C(CH3)3][CHC(CH3)3] (2b) (35±5%). These complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, reactivity tests with D2O and acetone (Wittig-type reaction), and spectroscopic methods (FT-IR and CP-MAS 13C NMR). The complexes were further transformed under hydrogen to a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex (3), which activated the CH bond of light alkanes like cyclooctane and methane to produce corresponding tantalum-alkyls. This surface tantalum complex was characterized as a predominant tantalum(III) monohydride species. The surface tantalum complexes exhibited reactivity similar to early transition metal hydrides.
