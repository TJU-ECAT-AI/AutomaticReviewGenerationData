The preparation of silica-supported tantalum monohydride (3) involves reacting SiOTa[CH2C(CH3)3]2[CHC(CH3)3] (2a) and (SiO)2Ta[CH2C(CH3)3][CHC(CH3)3] (2b) with hydrogen up to 200°C, leading to the formation of the predominant surface tantalum(III) monohydride (3) and SiH groups. The mechanism involves a hydride transfer from the expected tantalum(III) dihydride SiOTaH2 originating from 2a to a neighboring siloxane bridge, supporting the reactivity of this compound comparable to early transition metal hydrides.

The EXAFS analysis of 3 revealed a weak interaction from a third surface oxygen, likely a siloxane, with the tantalum center. The preparation of 2a was done using Schrock's method. The EXAFS studies confirmed two σ-bonded surface SiO groups attached to tantalum, with a TaO distance of 1.89 Å. The transformation of 65% of 2a and 35% of 2b into tantalum hydride led to the formation of 65% SiOTaH2 and 35% (SiO)2TaH, rather than solely one of these species.

3的EXAFS分析揭示了一个较弱的相互作用，来自于一个第三表面氧原子（很可能是一个硅氧烷），与钽中心相连。2a的制备使用了Schrock的方法。EXAFS研究证实了两个σ键的表面SiO组附着在钽上，TaO距离为1.89 Å。2a和2b的65%和35%转化为钽氢化物，导致形成65%的SiOTaH2和35%的(SiO)2TaH，而不是仅有一种这样的物种。
