Silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride (SiO)2TaIIIH (3) and SiH groups are predominantly formed when complexes 2a and 2b react with hydrogen up to 200°C. The preparation of 3 involves treating 2a and 2b under 1 atm of hydrogen at 150°C overnight followed by heating at 200°C for 2 hours. EXAFS studies confirm two σ-bonded surface SiO groups are attached to tantalum, while additional evidence points to a third surface oxygen interacting weakly with the tantalum center. The surface tantalum-alkyls are transformed under oxygen into (SiO)2TaV(O)(O-alkyl). Quantitative determinations on specific reactions support the formulation of 3 as a bis(siloxy)tantalum(III) monohydride.

当复合物2a和2b在氢气中加热至200°C时，会形成主要的二氧化硅支持的三价钽单氢化物（SiO）2TaIIIH（3）和SiH基团。3的制备涉及在1个大气压下将2a和2b加热至150°C过夜，随后加热至200°C持续2小时。EXAFS研究证实，两个与钽连接的表面SiO组存在，而额外的证据表明，一个第三的表面氧以较弱的相互作用与钽中心相互作用。表面钽-烷基转化为（SiO）2TaV(O)(O-烷基)在氧气下。定量确定在特定反应中的几个反应支持3作为二硅氧基三价钽单氢化物的主要表面物种的构成。
