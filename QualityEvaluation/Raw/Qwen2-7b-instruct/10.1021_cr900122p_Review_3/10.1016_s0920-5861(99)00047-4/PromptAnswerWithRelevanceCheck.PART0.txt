[1] "It will be shown that detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained by using advanced spectroscopic tools."
[2] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes."
[3] "In all these industrial processes, the heat obtained from the burning of coke is used in the dehydrogenation step."
[4] "Up to now, most reported characterization studies were done under conditions often far away from real catalytic conditions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Industrial processes for alkane dehydrogenation, such as the CATOFIN1 process, utilize the heat generated from the combustion of coke to facilitate the dehydrogenation step. The dehydrogenation process itself is endothermic, necessitating high temperatures and low pressures to achieve substantial yields of alkenes. Detailed insights into the dehydrogenation site can be acquired through the application of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques. However, the characterization studies conducted to date often deviate significantly from real-world catalytic conditions, indicating a gap in understanding the true behavior of catalysts under operational settings.

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the former likely exhibits faster reaction rates due to zirconium's ability to form stronger σ-bonds, enhancing H/D exchange and alkane metathesis efficiency. Thorium hydrides, on the other hand, might offer higher selectivity in certain reactions due to thorium's larger atomic radius, facilitating unique interactions with substrates. Both systems involve mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, but the specifics vary based on the metal's electronic properties and the specific conditions of the reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides might be more efficient in rapid, large-scale processes, while thorium hydrides could excel in scenarios requiring high selectivity and precise control over product distribution.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的性能，前者可能表现出更快的反应速率，因为锆能够形成更强的σ键，从而提高氢/氘交换和烷烃裂合的效率。而钍化物可能在某些反应中提供更高的选择性，这是由于钍的原子半径较大，能促进与底物的独特相互作用。这两种系统都涉及σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走等机制，但具体细节基于金属的电子性质和反应条件的不同而有所差异。二氧化硅支持的锆化物可能更适合快速、大规模的过程，而钍化物则可能在需要高选择性和精确控制产物分布的场景中表现更优。

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the former are characterized by their ability to undergo H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis, where the hydride group is transferred between molecules, leading to the formation of new C-H bonds. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit rapid reaction rates due to the high surface area and porosity of silica, enhancing the accessibility of reactants. High selectivity is achieved through the specific interactions between zirconium and silica, which guide the reaction pathways. Hydrogenolysis, the cleavage of C-H bonds by hydrogen, is also facilitated by the strong acidic sites provided by silica, leading to the formation of alkenes.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are less studied in C-H bond activation, but they are expected to follow similar principles. The high thermal stability of thorium allows for reactions at higher temperatures, which might be advantageous in certain industrial settings. However, alumina's greater tendency to promote thermal cracking reactions could limit the selectivity of alkane metathesis. The role of chain walking, the movement of a reactive group along a polymer chain, is less explored in thorium hydrides compared to zirconium hydrides, where it plays a crucial role in controlling the product distribution.

Both systems benefit from the use of in situ spectroscopic tools to monitor the structure and dynamics of the catalysts during reactions. These tools help in understanding the evolution of surface species, such as Cr6 and Cr3, under reaction conditions, which is essential for optimizing the catalyst performance and understanding the reaction mechanisms.

在C-H键激活反应中，二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢之间的对比，前者能够进行H/D交换和烷烃裂解。该机制涉及σ键的裂解，其中氢化物组分在分子之间转移，导致形成新的C-H键。由于二氧化硅的高比表面积和孔隙性，二氧化硅支持的锆化氢表现出快速的反应速率。通过特定的锆与二氧化硅相互作用，选择性得到了提高。通过二氧化硅提供的强酸性位点，氢化作用也被促进，从而生成烯烃。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活方面的研究较少，但预计它们遵循类似的原理。钍的高热稳定性允许在较高温度下进行反应，这可能在某些工业应用中具有优势。然而，氧化铝倾向于促进更严重的热裂解反应，这可能会限制烷烃裂解的选择性。链行走的作用，在锆化氢中扮演着关键角色，控制产物分布，而在钍化氢中的研究则较少。

这两个系统都受益于使用原位光谱技术监测催化剂在反应过程中的结构和动力学，这些工具对于理解表面物种（如Cr6和Cr3）的演变以及优化催化剂性能和理解反应机理至关重要。

The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts, specifically the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts used industrially. The document provides insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these catalysts. Detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained through advanced spectroscopic tools. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures and low pressures for significant yields of alkenes. Thermodynamics demonstrate that at higher temperatures, aromatization equilibria surpass dehydrogenation equilibria. Dehydration reactions produce more hydrogen than alkenes, necessitating the selection of optimal feed rates and temperatures for achieving an efficient industrial dehydration process. The surface composition reported in the text pertains to fully dehydrated catalysts. In situ Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have been utilized to monitor surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenations. Industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts impacts their structure, leading to deactivation.

文献主要关注在支持铬氧化物催化剂上进行烷烃脱氢，特别是工业上使用的Cr/Al2O3催化剂。文本提供了关于这些催化剂制备、结构和催化性质的见解。通过高级光谱学工具可以获取脱氢作用位点的详细信息。烷烃脱氢是一个吸热过程，需要较高的温度和较低的压力以获得显著的烯烃产率。热力学表明，在较高温度下，芳香化平衡超过脱氢平衡。脱水反应产生比烯烃更多的氢气，需要选择适当的进料速率和温度以实现具有所需选择性的高效工业脱氢过程。文中报告的表面组成适用于完全脱氢的催化剂。原位拉曼光谱和近红外区域的散射反射光谱被用于监测反应条件下表面铬物种的变化。工业循环对Cr/Al2O3催化剂的结构有影响，最终导致催化剂失活。

The dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts is crucial for the industrial production of propene and isobutene. These catalysts, especially Cr/Al2O3, are widely used due to their ability to produce alkenes from low-cost hydrocarbon feedstocks. The process is endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures for efficient alkenes production. The reactions are generally unselective, with high temperatures favoring not only dehydrogenation but also thermal cracking and coke formation. Suitable catalysts must possess good activity and selectivity while suppressing unwanted reactions. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, are known for their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation, and their use has led to commercial processes such as the CATO-FIN1, which leads the world in propene and isobutene production. Other studies have explored catalysts based on SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2, aiming to improve selectivity and activity.

烷烃在支持的铬氧化物催化剂上的脱氢对于丙烯和异丁烯的工业生产至关重要。特别是Cr/Al2O3催化剂，因其能够从低成本的饱和烃原料中制备烯烃而被广泛应用。该过程是吸热的，需要较高的温度和较低的压力来获得有效的烯烃产量。反应通常缺乏选择性，高温不仅促进脱氢，还促进轻烷烃裂解和焦炭形成。合适的催化剂不仅要具有良好的活性和选择性，还要抑制不希望的反应。已知支持的铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是Cr2O3/Al2O3，具有在烷烃脱氢方面的优越性能，并导致了商业过程如CATO-FIN1的开发，后者在全球丙烯和异丁烯生产中处于领先地位。其他研究探索了基于SiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2的催化剂，旨在提高选择性和活性。
