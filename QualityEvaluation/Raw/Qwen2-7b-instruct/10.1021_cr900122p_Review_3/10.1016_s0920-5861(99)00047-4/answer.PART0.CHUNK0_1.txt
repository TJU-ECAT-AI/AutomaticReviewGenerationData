[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [1]."
[2] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver [6], and by Kearby [7]."
[3] "In situ Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the reduction process of surface Cr6 species on a 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of n-butane."
[4] "It was concluded that polychromate was more readily reducible than monochromate [32]."
[5] "In situ DRS spectroscopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3 [5759]."
[6] "Thus, surface Cr3 species are formed under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6."
[7] "The nature of these surface Cr3 species was further unraveled by infrared spectroscopy measurements of adsorbed probe molecules (CO/NO)."
[8] "De Rossi et al. [45] concluded that isolated Cr3 sites with two coordinative vacancies are formed on 0.161.55 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of n-propane."

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the former likely exhibits faster reaction rates due to zirconium's ability to form stronger σ-bonds, enhancing H/D exchange and alkane metathesis efficiency. Thorium hydrides, on the other hand, might offer higher selectivity in certain reactions due to thorium's larger atomic radius, facilitating unique interactions with substrates. Both systems involve mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, but the specifics vary based on the metal's electronic properties and the specific conditions of the reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides might be more efficient in rapid, large-scale processes, while thorium hydrides could excel in scenarios requiring high selectivity and precise control over product distribution.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的性能，前者可能表现出更快的反应速率，因为锆能够形成更强的σ键，从而提高氢/氘交换和烷烃裂合的效率。而钍化物可能在某些反应中提供更高的选择性，这是由于钍的原子半径较大，能促进与底物的独特相互作用。这两种系统都涉及σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走等机制，但具体细节基于金属的电子性质和反应条件的不同而有所差异。二氧化硅支持的锆化物可能更适合快速、大规模的过程，而钍化物则可能在需要高选择性和精确控制产物分布的场景中表现更优。
