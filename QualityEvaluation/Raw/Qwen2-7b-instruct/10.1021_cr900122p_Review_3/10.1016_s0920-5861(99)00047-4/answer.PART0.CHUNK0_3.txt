The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts, specifically the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts used industrially. The document provides insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these catalysts. Detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained through advanced spectroscopic tools. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures and low pressures for significant yields of alkenes. Thermodynamics demonstrate that at higher temperatures, aromatization equilibria surpass dehydrogenation equilibria. Dehydration reactions produce more hydrogen than alkenes, necessitating the selection of optimal feed rates and temperatures for achieving an efficient industrial dehydration process. The surface composition reported in the text pertains to fully dehydrated catalysts. In situ Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have been utilized to monitor surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenations. Industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts impacts their structure, leading to deactivation.

文献主要关注在支持铬氧化物催化剂上进行烷烃脱氢，特别是工业上使用的Cr/Al2O3催化剂。文本提供了关于这些催化剂制备、结构和催化性质的见解。通过高级光谱学工具可以获取脱氢作用位点的详细信息。烷烃脱氢是一个吸热过程，需要较高的温度和较低的压力以获得显著的烯烃产率。热力学表明，在较高温度下，芳香化平衡超过脱氢平衡。脱水反应产生比烯烃更多的氢气，需要选择适当的进料速率和温度以实现具有所需选择性的高效工业脱氢过程。文中报告的表面组成适用于完全脱氢的催化剂。原位拉曼光谱和近红外区域的散射反射光谱被用于监测反应条件下表面铬物种的变化。工业循环对Cr/Al2O3催化剂的结构有影响，最终导致催化剂失活。
