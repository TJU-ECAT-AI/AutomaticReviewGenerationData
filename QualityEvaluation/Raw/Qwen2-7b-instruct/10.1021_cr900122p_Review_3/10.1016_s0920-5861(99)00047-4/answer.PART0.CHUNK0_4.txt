[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas iso- butene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."
[3] "The reknown CATO-FIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively."
[4] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes."
[5] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
[6] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
[7] "As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions."
[8] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."
[9] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver [6], and by Kearby [7]."

The dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts is crucial for the industrial production of propene and isobutene. These catalysts, especially Cr/Al2O3, are widely used due to their ability to produce alkenes from low-cost hydrocarbon feedstocks. The process is endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures for efficient alkenes production. The reactions are generally unselective, with high temperatures favoring not only dehydrogenation but also thermal cracking and coke formation. Suitable catalysts must possess good activity and selectivity while suppressing unwanted reactions. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, are known for their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation, and their use has led to commercial processes such as the CATO-FIN1, which leads the world in propene and isobutene production. Other studies have explored catalysts based on SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2, aiming to improve selectivity and activity.

烷烃在支持的铬氧化物催化剂上的脱氢对于丙烯和异丁烯的工业生产至关重要。特别是Cr/Al2O3催化剂，因其能够从低成本的饱和烃原料中制备烯烃而被广泛应用。该过程是吸热的，需要较高的温度和较低的压力来获得有效的烯烃产量。反应通常缺乏选择性，高温不仅促进脱氢，还促进轻烷烃裂解和焦炭形成。合适的催化剂不仅要具有良好的活性和选择性，还要抑制不希望的反应。已知支持的铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是Cr2O3/Al2O3，具有在烷烃脱氢方面的优越性能，并导致了商业过程如CATO-FIN1的开发，后者在全球丙烯和异丁烯生产中处于领先地位。其他研究探索了基于SiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2的催化剂，旨在提高选择性和活性。
