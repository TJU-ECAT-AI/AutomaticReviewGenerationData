Industrial processes for alkane dehydrogenation, such as the CATOFIN1 process, utilize the heat generated from the combustion of coke to facilitate the dehydrogenation step. The dehydrogenation process itself is endothermic, necessitating high temperatures and low pressures to achieve substantial yields of alkenes. Detailed insights into the dehydrogenation site can be acquired through the application of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques. However, the characterization studies conducted to date often deviate significantly from real-world catalytic conditions, indicating a gap in understanding the true behavior of catalysts under operational settings.

工业过程中的烷烃脱氢，如CATOFIN1工艺，利用从焦炭燃烧产生的热量来促进脱氢步骤。脱氢过程是吸热的，需要高温和低压才能获得大量烯烃。通过应用先进的光谱技术可以获得有关脱氢位点的详细信息。然而，目前进行的表征研究往往与实际催化条件相去甚远，表明在理解催化剂在操作条件下的真实行为方面存在缺口。
