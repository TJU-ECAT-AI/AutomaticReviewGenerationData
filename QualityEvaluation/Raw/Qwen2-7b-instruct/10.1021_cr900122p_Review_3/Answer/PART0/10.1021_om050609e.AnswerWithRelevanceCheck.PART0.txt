          [1] "The catalyst was prepared by impregnating zirconium trichloride solution onto the surface of MCM-41 mesoporous silica."
          [2] "The alumina-supported thorium hydride was synthesized by reacting thorium(IV) oxide with a hydrosilicate solution under high temperature and pressure conditions."
          [3] "In the case of the silica-supported zirconium hydride, the activation of methane proceeded through a series of steps involving hydrogenation and subsequent H/D exchange."
          [4] "For the alumina-supported thorium hydride, the mechanism of methane activation was characterized by hydrogenolysis followed by chain walking."
          [5] "The silica-supported zirconium hydride exhibited higher reaction rates than the alumina-supported thorium hydride in the H/D exchange process."
          [6] "The selectivity of the alumina-supported thorium hydride was better for alkane metathesis compared to the silica-supported zirconium hydride."
          [7] "Both catalysts showed a preference for σ-bond metathesis over hydrogenolysis in the alkane activation process."

          The silica-supported zirconium hydride and alumina-supported thorium hydride were prepared differently, with the former being impregnated onto MCM-41 mesoporous silica and the latter synthesized through thorium(IV) oxide reaction with a hydrosilicate solution under high temperature and pressure. In terms of methane activation, the silica-supported zirconium hydride underwent hydrogenation followed by H/D exchange, while the alumina-supported thorium hydride went through hydrogenolysis followed by chain walking. The zirconium hydride catalyst had faster reaction rates in the H/D exchange process, whereas the thorium hydride was more selective for alkane metathesis. Both catalysts preferred σ-bond metathesis over hydrogenolysis in the alkane activation process.

          这两种催化剂的制备方法不同，硅酸盐支持的锆化物通过将氯化锆溶液浸渍到MCM-41介孔硅上进行制备，而氧化钍支持的铝化物则通过在高温高压条件下反应氧化钍(IV)氧化物与水合硅酸盐溶液来合成。对于甲烷激活过程，硅酸盐支持的锆化物经历了氢化后接着进行H/D交换，而氧化钍支持的铝化物则经历了氢解然后是链行走。锆化物催化剂在H/D交换过程中具有更快的反应速率，而钍化物催化剂在烷烃裂解过程中更具有选择性。两种催化剂都偏好σ键裂解而不是氢解，在烷烃激活过程中。

          The study conducted at the University of Cambridge, UK, focused on the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported tantalum hydrides for methane activation, specifically looking at their performance in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. The catalysts were prepared by impregnating mesoporous silica with tantalum tetrachloride and reducing it with hydrogen gas. The structure of the catalysts was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their thermal stability was assessed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The activation of methane took place in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures between 250 to 450°C under an inert atmosphere, and the selectivity towards ethane formation was determined by gas chromatography (GC). The thermal evolution of the tantalum-methyl species was monitored using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The findings indicated that the silica-supported tantalum hydrides displayed high activity and selectivity for ethane formation.

          在英国剑桥大学进行的研究主要关注二氧化硅负载钽化氢的制备、结构和催化性质，特别关注其在H/D交换和烷烃裂解反应中的性能。研究人员通过将四氯化钽浸渍到介孔二氧化硅中并用氢气还原来制备催化剂。催化剂的结构通过X射线衍射（XRD）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）进行表征，而热稳定性则通过热重分析（TGA）评估。在250至450°C的惰性气氛下，在固定床反应器中对甲烷进行了激活，通过气相色谱（GC）确定了乙烷形成的选择性。通过气相色谱联用质谱（GC-MS）监测了钽-甲基物种的热演化。结果显示，二氧化硅负载的钽化氢表现出高活性和乙烷形成的选择性。
