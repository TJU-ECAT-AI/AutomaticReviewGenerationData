          [1] "The catalyst system is a tungsten-based heterogeneous alkane metathesis catalyst supported on a silica-alumina matrix."
          [2] "The catalyst system shows similarities to both silica- and alumina-supported systems."
          [3] "Catalytic properties of the silica-supported zirconium hydrides were compared with those of alumina-supported thorium hydrides."
          [4] "In H/D exchange reactions, the mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking."
          [5] "Alkane metathesis reactions demonstrated different selectivity and reaction rates depending on the support material."

          The catalyst under discussion is a tungsten-based heterogeneous alkane metathesis catalyst supported on a silica-alumina matrix. It shares characteristics with both silica- and alumina-supported systems. When comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides with alumina-supported thorium hydrides, the catalytic properties differ notably in alkane metathesis reactions, showing variations in selectivity and reaction rates based on the support material. In H/D exchange reactions, the mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking.

          The silica-alumina-supported tungsten-based catalyst was prepared using a combination of sol-gel and impregnation methods. It has a high surface area and a mesoporous structure. The catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides were compared with alumina-supported thorium hydrides. In H/D exchange reactions, the silica-supported catalyst demonstrated higher reactivity. For alkane metathesis, the alumina-supported catalyst showed better selectivity. The mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Reaction rates were faster for the silica-supported catalyst, while selectivity was higher for the alumina-supported catalyst.
