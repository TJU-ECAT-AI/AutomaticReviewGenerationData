The study examines whether a silica-alumina-supported tungsten-based catalyst is more similar to a silica-supported or an alumina-supported system in terms of its preparation, structure, and catalytic properties.

The silica-supported zirconium hydride and alumina-supported thorium hydride were prepared differently, with the former being impregnated onto MCM-41 mesoporous silica and the latter synthesized through thorium(IV) oxide reaction with a hydrosilicate solution under high temperature and pressure. In terms of methane activation, the silica-supported zirconium hydride underwent hydrogenation followed by H/D exchange, while the alumina-supported thorium hydride went through hydrogenolysis followed by chain walking. The zirconium hydride catalyst had faster reaction rates in the H/D exchange process, whereas the thorium hydride was more selective for alkane metathesis. Both catalysts preferred σ-bond metathesis over hydrogenolysis in the alkane activation process.

The comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions reveals distinct preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are more reactive in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit enhanced stability and selectivity under similar conditions. Mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking play crucial roles in these processes, affecting reaction rates and selectivity differently for each type of catalyst.

A well-defined silica-supported tungsten imido alkylidene complex was utilized as a catalyst for olefin metathesis reactions, displaying high activity and stability. This catalyst had superior thermal stability compared to unsupported tungsten complexes. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides were less effective in C-H bond activation, showing lower selectivity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Zirconium hydrides supported on silica showed faster reaction rates than thorium hydrides.

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides, the literature emphasizes their differences in preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. The mechanisms for H/D exchange and alkane metathesis are explored, along with the factors affecting reaction rates and selectivity. The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes are also discussed.

The document describes the synthesis and characterization of titanocene bis(neopentyl) complexes, which serve as convenient precursors for the formation of unsaturated alkylidene species capable of intermolecular C-H activation. These complexes are generated under mild conditions, and their stability is influenced by alkyl substitution on the cyclopentadienyl ligand. The reaction pathways involve a-hydrogen abstraction and intermolecular addition of both sp2- and sp3-C-H bonds to the Ti=C double bond. The efficiency of trapping by C-H bonds is substrate-dependent, with competition experiments revealing different trapping efficiencies in various solvents. The mechanism of intermolecular C-H activation involves the activation of hydrocarbon C-H bonds by reactive titanocene neopentylidene intermediates, which contrasts with α-elimination reactions from metal-hydrocarbyl-amido complexes.

The mechanism typically involves alkyl radical species generated at the catalyst surface, reacting quickly in the adsorbed state through transformations like β-elimination or oxidative attack by adsorbed oxygen species, further reacting near the catalyst surface in the boundary layer, or transferring into the gas phase for continued reaction.
