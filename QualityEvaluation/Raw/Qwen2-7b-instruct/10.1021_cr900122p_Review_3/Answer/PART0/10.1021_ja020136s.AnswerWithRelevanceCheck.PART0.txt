          Comparison of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions requires understanding their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. This involves examining their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, including reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking.
