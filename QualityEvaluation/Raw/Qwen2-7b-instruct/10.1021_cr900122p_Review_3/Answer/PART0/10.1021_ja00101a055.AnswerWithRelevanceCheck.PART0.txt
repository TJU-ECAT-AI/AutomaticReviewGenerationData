          [1] "The study investigates the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions."
          [2] "In H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, the mechanisms involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking."
          [3] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides show higher reactivity and better selectivity compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides."
          [4] "The rate of reaction, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking were discussed in detail."

         The study compares the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It discusses the mechanisms involved in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, which include σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit higher reactivity and better selectivity than alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The rates of reaction, selectivity, and the roles of these mechanisms are thoroughly examined.
