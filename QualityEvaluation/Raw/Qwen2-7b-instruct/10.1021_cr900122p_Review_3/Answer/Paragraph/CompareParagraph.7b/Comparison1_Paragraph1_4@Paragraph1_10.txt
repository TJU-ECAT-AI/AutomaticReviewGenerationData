    "Summary": "Both reviews effectively summarize the topic of catalytic mechanisms and reactivity of surface-supported metal species in C-H bond activation, H/D exchange, and alkane metathesis reactions. They are comparable in terms of content quality, organization, academic standards, and writing quality. However, neither review stands out in proposing new research directions or critically analyzing existing research, nor do they deeply explore interdisciplinary perspectives or the practical application potential. The scores suggest that both reviews have room for improvement in terms of innovation and critical thinking."
