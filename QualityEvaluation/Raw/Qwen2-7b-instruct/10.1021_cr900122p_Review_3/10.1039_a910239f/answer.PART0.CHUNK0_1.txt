The silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1 is capable of catalyzing the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150°C, resulting in the formation of all methane isotopomers with a statistical distribution. It can also activate the C-H bond of cyclic alkanes, forming a tantalum cycloalkyl species. This catalyst exhibits higher activity in the H/D exchange reaction compared to alkane metathesis due to the involvement of a C-H bond cleavage. The catalytic mechanism is consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that the tantalum hydride species acts as the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle rather than the TaCH3 species.

二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物(·SiO)2TaH 1能够在150°C下催化CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应，产生所有甲烷同位素的统计分布。它还可以激活环烷烃中的C-H键，形成钽环烷基物种。与烷烃互换相比，该催化剂在H/D交换反应中表现出更高的活性，因为涉及的是C-H键的断裂而不是烷烃互换。催化机制与实验观察结果一致，表明钽氢化物种作为催化循环中的活性中间体起作用，而不是TaCH3物种。

[1] "When a 55+45 mixture of CH4/CD4 was contacted with 1 at 150 C for 10 h, it was converted into a mixture of all the isotopomers of methane as a statistical distribution (Fig. 1)."

In a 10-hour contact of a 55:45 mixture of CH4/CD4 with catalyst 1 at 150°C, all methane isotopomers were produced in a statistical distribution. At lower conversion stages, d1- and d3-methanes were formed more rapidly than d2-methane, indicating a stepwise H/D exchange through the sequential substitution of one H/D atom. The equilibrium mixture analysis by GCMS showed a 24%, 40%, 24%, 12%, and 0% distribution of d0-, d1-, d2-, d3-, and d4-methanes, respectively, matching the calculated statistical distribution. As a comparison, the catalysis of ethane metathesis by the same surface complex 1 under similar conditions resulted in a turnover number (TON) of approximately 4 after 6 hours. The evolution of catalyst 1 during the reaction with CH4/CD4 mixtures was tracked using in situ infrared spectroscopy.

当将一种55:45的CH4/CD4混合物与1接触10小时，并在150°C下进行时，所有甲烷同位素将以统计分布的形式被转化为混合物。在较低转化率阶段，d1-和d3-甲烷比d2-甲烷形成得更快，这表明H/D交换是通过一次交换一个H/D原子的方式逐步进行的。根据GCMS分析，平衡混合物的组成分别是d0-、d1-、d2-、d3-和d4-甲烷的24%、40%、24%、12%和0%，与计算得到的统计分布相符。作为比较，在相似的实验条件下，使用相同的表面复合物1催化乙烷互换后，6小时内的周转数（TON）约为4。在用CH4/CD4混合物反应过程中，通过原位红外光谱跟踪催化剂1的演变情况。

[1] "The number of turnovers for this exchange reaction can be estimated according to eqn. (1) if considering that (a) the formation of CDH3 and CD3H requires at least one CH(D) bond cleavage and formation from CH4 and CD4, respectively, and that (b) the formation of CD2H2 necessitates at least two C H bond cleavages and formations from either CH4 or CD4."

The number of turnovers for the H/D exchange reaction can be estimated based on equation (1), taking into account that (a) the formation of CDH3 and CD3H requires at least one CH(D) bond cleavage from CH4 and CD4, respectively, and (b) the formation of CD2H2 necessitates at least two C-H bond cleavages from either CH4 or CD4. The high reactivity of catalyst 1 in the H/D exchange process is not surprising, as it involves the cleavage of a C-H bond instead of a C-C bond in alkane metathesis. A similar H/D exchange occurs between deuterated methane and hydrogen. The initial rates obtained in the exchange of CH4/CD4 and CD4/H2 are not significantly different, supporting the conclusion that the cleavage of the C-H bond is the rate-limiting step for both transformations. Two possible mechanisms for the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 can be proposed.

对于H/D交换反应，可以基于等式（1）来估算其周转次数，考虑到（a）形成CDH3和CD3H需要至少从CH4和CD4分别进行一次CH(D)键断裂和形成，以及（b）形成CD2H2需要至少从CH4或CD4进行两次C-H键断裂和形成。催化剂1在H/D交换过程中的高活性并不令人意外，因为它涉及烷烃互换中的C-H键断裂而不是C-C键断裂。H/D交换发生在去氘化的甲烷和氢之间。在CH4/CD4和CD4/H2交换中获得的初始速率没有显著差异，这与C-H键断裂是两个转变的决定性步骤相一致。两个可能的机制可以解释CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应。
