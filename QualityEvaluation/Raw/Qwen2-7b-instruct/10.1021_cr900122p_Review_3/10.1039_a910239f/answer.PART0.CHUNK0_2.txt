Silica-supported tantalum hydrides (·SiO)2TaH1 exhibit high activity in the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4, catalyzing the formation of all methane isotopomers statistically. This process is more efficient than alkane metathesis due to the cleavage of the CH bond instead of the CC bond. The catalyst can also activate cyclic alkanes to form tantalum cycloalkyl species and catalyze both hydrogenolysis of alkanes and alkane metathesis. In situ IR spectroscopy allows monitoring of the reaction evolution, and two mechanisms for the H/D exchange reaction can be proposed. A two-step experiment suggests that the reaction mechanism influences the isotopomeric distribution.

硅支持的钽氢化物(·SiO)2TaH1在甲烷和CD4之间的H/D交换反应中表现出高活性，催化生成所有甲烷同位素的统计分布。由于CH键的断裂而不是烷烃裂解，这个过程比烷烃裂解更有效。该催化剂还可以激活环烷烃形成钽环烷基物种，并催化烷烃的氢解和烷烃裂解。原位红外光谱可以监测反应的演化，可以提出两种H/D交换反应机制。两步实验表明反应机制影响同位素分布。
