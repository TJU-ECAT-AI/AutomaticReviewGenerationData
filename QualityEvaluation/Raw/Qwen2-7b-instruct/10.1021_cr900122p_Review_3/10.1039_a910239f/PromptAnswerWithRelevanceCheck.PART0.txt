[1] "The silica supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1,catalyses the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150 C producing the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers."
[2] "Its rate is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than that of the alkane metathesis reaction."
[3] "Despite the probable formation of TaCD3 species in step 1 (vide supra), it does not participate efficiently in the H/D exchange process since CD3H has not been observed [mechanism (b), step 2]."
[4] "The consumption of CH4 and CD4 as well as the formation of the different isotopomers of methane (d1, d2, d3) were monitored by IR spectroscopy."
[5] "The silica supported tantalum hydride 1 catalyses the H/D exchange reaction in CH4/CD4 mixtures. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions and leads to the formation of the statistical distribution of all isotopomers of methane."
[6] "A two-step experiment, in which 1 is first contacted with CD4 (step 1) and then with CH4 (step 2) under the same conditions,should provide a different isotopomeric distribution depending on the reaction mechanism (Scheme 2)."
[7] "The addition at room temperature of a mixture of d0- and d4-methanes to 1 did not lead to a significant decrease in intensity of the n(TaH) band, centered at 1825 cm−1."
[8] "After removing the gas phase, the addition of 20 Torr of CH4 (step 2) followed by a 3 h reaction at 150 C gave CDH3 as the only deuterated product present in the gas phase."
[9] "Consequently, mechanism (a) which only involves TaH bonds instead of TaC bonds [mechanism (b)] appears to be the most consistent to describe the H/D exchange between methanes."

Silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1 catalyzes the H/D exchange between CH4 and CD4, forming the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers. Its catalytic rate for this reaction is about two orders of magnitude faster than alkane metathesis. In a two-step experiment, the mechanism of the H/D exchange can be distinguished based on the isotopomer distribution produced. The reaction occurs under mild conditions, using mild temperatures, and does not require harsh conditions. The consumption of CH4 and CD4, as well as the formation of different isotopomers, is monitored by IR spectroscopy. In the first step, the complex reacts with CD4, potentially forming TaCD3 species. However, these species do not efficiently participate in the H/D exchange process. In the second step, the addition of CH4 leads to the formation of CDH3 as the only deuterated product, supporting the conclusion that mechanism (a), involving only TaH bonds, best describes the H/D exchange.

In contrast, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not mentioned in the provided literature, and thus their specific preparation, structure, and catalytic properties cannot be compared. The mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis are likely different for these materials, given the unique properties of zirconium and thorium hydrides. However, the literature focuses on the use of silica-supported tantalum hydride for these reactions, providing insights into its structure, preparation, and catalytic behavior in C-H bond activation. The rates of these reactions, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are not discussed in detail for other materials beyond the tantalum hydride system described.

二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物（·SiO）2TaH 1催化了CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换，产生了所有甲烷同位素的统计分布。此反应的催化速率约为烷烃互换的两数量级。在两步实验中，可以通过不同同位素分布产生的反应机制进行区分。在温和条件下进行反应，并不需要苛刻条件。通过红外光谱监测CH4和CD4的消耗以及不同同位素的形成。在第一步中，复合物与CD4反应，可能形成TaCD3物种。然而，这些物种在H/D交换过程中并不高效参与。在第二步中，添加CH4导致CDH3作为唯一的氘标记产物存在于气相中，支持结论，即仅涉及TaH键的机制（a）最能描述甲烷之间的H/D交换。

相比之下，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物未在提供的文献中提及，因此无法比较它们的制备、结构和催化性质。对于这些材料而言，H/D交换和烷烃互换的机制很可能不同，鉴于锆和钍氢化物的独特性质。然而，文献主要关注二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物在这些反应中的应用，提供了关于其结构、制备及其在C-H键活化行为方面的见解。这些反应的速率、选择性和σ-键互换、氢解离和链行走的作用在描述其他材料系统时并未详细讨论。

The silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1 is capable of catalyzing the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150°C, resulting in the formation of all methane isotopomers with a statistical distribution. It can also activate the C-H bond of cyclic alkanes, forming a tantalum cycloalkyl species. This catalyst exhibits higher activity in the H/D exchange reaction compared to alkane metathesis due to the involvement of a C-H bond cleavage. The catalytic mechanism is consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that the tantalum hydride species acts as the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle rather than the TaCH3 species.

[1] "When a 55+45 mixture of CH4/CD4 was contacted with 1 at 150 C for 10 h, it was converted into a mixture of all the isotopomers of methane as a statistical distribution (Fig. 1)."
[2] "At low conversion, d1- and d3-methanes were formed faster than d2-methane, suggesting that the H/D exchange was stepwise via the exchange of one H/D atom at a time [Fig. 1(a)]."
[3] "The composition of the equilibrated mixture according to GCMS was 24, 40, 24, 12, 0% of d0-, d1-,d2-, d3- and d4-methanes, respectively, in good agreement with the calculated statistical distribution."
[4] "For a comparison, the metathesis of ethane catalysed by the same surface complex 1 under similar experimental conditions has reached a TON of ca. 4 after 6 h."

In a 10-hour contact of a 55:45 mixture of CH4/CD4 with catalyst 1 at 150°C, all methane isotopomers were produced in a statistical distribution. At lower conversion stages, d1- and d3-methanes were formed more rapidly than d2-methane, indicating a stepwise H/D exchange through the sequential substitution of one H/D atom. The equilibrium mixture analysis by GCMS showed a 24%, 40%, 24%, 12%, and 0% distribution of d0-, d1-, d2-, d3-, and d4-methanes, respectively, matching the calculated statistical distribution. As a comparison, the catalysis of ethane metathesis by the same surface complex 1 under similar conditions resulted in a turnover number (TON) of approximately 4 after 6 hours. The evolution of catalyst 1 during the reaction with CH4/CD4 mixtures was tracked using in situ infrared spectroscopy.

当将一种55:45的CH4/CD4混合物与1接触10小时，并在150°C下进行时，所有甲烷同位素将以统计分布的形式被转化为混合物。在较低转化率阶段，d1-和d3-甲烷比d2-甲烷形成得更快，这表明H/D交换是通过一次交换一个H/D原子的方式逐步进行的。根据GCMS分析，平衡混合物的组成分别是d0-、d1-、d2-、d3-和d4-甲烷的24%、40%、24%、12%和0%，与计算得到的统计分布相符。作为比较，在相似的实验条件下，使用相同的表面复合物1催化乙烷互换后，6小时内的周转数（TON）约为4。在用CH4/CD4混合物反应过程中，通过原位红外光谱跟踪催化剂1的演变情况。

[1] "The number of turnovers for this exchange reaction can be estimated according to eqn. (1) if considering that (a) the formation of CDH3 and CD3H requires at least one CH(D) bond cleavage and formation from CH4 and CD4, respectively, and that (b) the formation of CD2H2 necessitates at least two C H bond cleavages and formations from either CH4 or CD4."
[2] "The higher activity of 1 for H/D exchange reaction is however not surprising since this process involves CH in place of CC bond cleavage for alkane metathesis."
[3] "A similar H/D-exchange also occurs between deuterated methane and hydrogen."
[4] "The initial rates obtained in the exchange of CH4/CD4 and CD4/H2 do not appear to be significantly different, which is in agreement with the cleavage of the CH bond being the rate-determining step for both transformations."
[5] "Two mechanisms for the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 can be proposed."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The number of turnovers for the H/D exchange reaction can be estimated based on equation (1), taking into account that (a) the formation of CDH3 and CD3H requires at least one CH(D) bond cleavage from CH4 and CD4, respectively, and (b) the formation of CD2H2 necessitates at least two C-H bond cleavages from either CH4 or CD4. The high reactivity of catalyst 1 in the H/D exchange process is not surprising, as it involves the cleavage of a C-H bond instead of a C-C bond in alkane metathesis. A similar H/D exchange occurs between deuterated methane and hydrogen. The initial rates obtained in the exchange of CH4/CD4 and CD4/H2 are not significantly different, supporting the conclusion that the cleavage of the C-H bond is the rate-limiting step for both transformations. Two possible mechanisms for the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 can be proposed.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于H/D交换反应，可以基于等式（1）来估算其周转次数，考虑到（a）形成CDH3和CD3H需要至少从CH4和CD4分别进行一次CH(D)键断裂和形成，以及（b）形成CD2H2需要至少从CH4或CD4进行两次C-H键断裂和形成。催化剂1在H/D交换过程中的高活性并不令人意外，因为它涉及烷烃互换中的C-H键断裂而不是C-C键断裂。H/D交换发生在去氘化的甲烷和氢之间。在CH4/CD4和CD4/H2交换中获得的初始速率没有显著差异，这与C-H键断裂是两个转变的决定性步骤相一致。两个可能的机制可以解释CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应。

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides (·SiO)2TaH1 exhibit high activity in the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4, catalyzing the formation of all methane isotopomers statistically. This process is more efficient than alkane metathesis due to the cleavage of the CH bond instead of the CC bond. The catalyst can also activate cyclic alkanes to form tantalum cycloalkyl species and catalyze both hydrogenolysis of alkanes and alkane metathesis. In situ IR spectroscopy allows monitoring of the reaction evolution, and two mechanisms for the H/D exchange reaction can be proposed. A two-step experiment suggests that the reaction mechanism influences the isotopomeric distribution.
