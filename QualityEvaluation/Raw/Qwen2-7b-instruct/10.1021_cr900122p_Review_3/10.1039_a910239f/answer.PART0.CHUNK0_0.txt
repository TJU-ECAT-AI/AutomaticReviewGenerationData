Silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1 catalyzes the H/D exchange between CH4 and CD4, forming the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers. Its catalytic rate for this reaction is about two orders of magnitude faster than alkane metathesis. In a two-step experiment, the mechanism of the H/D exchange can be distinguished based on the isotopomer distribution produced. The reaction occurs under mild conditions, using mild temperatures, and does not require harsh conditions. The consumption of CH4 and CD4, as well as the formation of different isotopomers, is monitored by IR spectroscopy. In the first step, the complex reacts with CD4, potentially forming TaCD3 species. However, these species do not efficiently participate in the H/D exchange process. In the second step, the addition of CH4 leads to the formation of CDH3 as the only deuterated product, supporting the conclusion that mechanism (a), involving only TaH bonds, best describes the H/D exchange.

In contrast, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not mentioned in the provided literature, and thus their specific preparation, structure, and catalytic properties cannot be compared. The mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis are likely different for these materials, given the unique properties of zirconium and thorium hydrides. However, the literature focuses on the use of silica-supported tantalum hydride for these reactions, providing insights into its structure, preparation, and catalytic behavior in C-H bond activation. The rates of these reactions, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are not discussed in detail for other materials beyond the tantalum hydride system described.

二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物（·SiO）2TaH 1催化了CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换，产生了所有甲烷同位素的统计分布。此反应的催化速率约为烷烃互换的两数量级。在两步实验中，可以通过不同同位素分布产生的反应机制进行区分。在温和条件下进行反应，并不需要苛刻条件。通过红外光谱监测CH4和CD4的消耗以及不同同位素的形成。在第一步中，复合物与CD4反应，可能形成TaCD3物种。然而，这些物种在H/D交换过程中并不高效参与。在第二步中，添加CH4导致CDH3作为唯一的氘标记产物存在于气相中，支持结论，即仅涉及TaH键的机制（a）最能描述甲烷之间的H/D交换。

相比之下，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物未在提供的文献中提及，因此无法比较它们的制备、结构和催化性质。对于这些材料而言，H/D交换和烷烃互换的机制很可能不同，鉴于锆和钍氢化物的独特性质。然而，文献主要关注二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物在这些反应中的应用，提供了关于其结构、制备及其在C-H键活化行为方面的见解。这些反应的速率、选择性和σ-键互换、氢解离和链行走的作用在描述其他材料系统时并未详细讨论。
