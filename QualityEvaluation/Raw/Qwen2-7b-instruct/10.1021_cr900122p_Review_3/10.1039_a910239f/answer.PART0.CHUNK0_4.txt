[1] "The silica supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1,catalyses the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150 C producing the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers."
[2] "It can activate the CH bond of cyclic alkanes, to form a tantalum cycloalkyl species, (·SiO)2Ta CnH2n21."
[3] "For a comparison, the metathesis of ethane catalysed by the same surface complex 1 under similar experimental conditions has reached a TON of ca. 4 after 6 h."
[4] "The higher activity of 1 for H/D exchange reaction is however not surprising since this process involves CH in place of CC bond cleavage for alkane metathesis."
[5] "A mechanism in which the tantalum hydride species is the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle rather than the TaCH3 species is consistent with the experimental observations."

The silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1 catalyzes the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150°C, resulting in the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers. It is capable of activating the CH bond of cyclic alkanes to form a tantalum cycloalkyl species. Compared to the metathesis of ethane catalyzed by the same surface complex, 1 exhibits significantly higher activity for the H/D exchange reaction, as it involves the cleavage of a CH bond instead of a CC bond during alkane metathesis. A mechanism involving the tantalum hydride species as the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle aligns with the experimental observations.

二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物（·SiO）2TaH 1在150°C下催化CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应，产生所有甲烷同位素的统计分布。它能够激活环烷烃中的CH键形成钽环烷基物种。与相同表面复合物催化下进行的乙烷裂解相比，1的H/D交换反应活性更高，因为它涉及烷烃裂解时CH键的断裂而非CC键的断裂。一个机制表明，钽氢化物种作为催化循环中的活性中间体，与实验观察结果一致。
