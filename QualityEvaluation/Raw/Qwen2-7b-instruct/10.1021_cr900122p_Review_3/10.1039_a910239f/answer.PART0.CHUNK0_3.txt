Silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1 catalyzes the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150°C, producing a statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers. It activates the CH bond of cyclic alkanes, forming a tantalum cycloalkyl species. The rate of this H/D exchange reaction is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than that of alkane metathesis. The mechanism involves the tantalum hydride species acting as the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle, not the TaCH3 species, which aligns with the experimental observations. IR spectroscopy is used to monitor the consumption of CH4 and CD4 and the formation of different isotopomers of methane.

二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物（·SiO）2TaH 1在150°C下催化甲烷与CD4之间的H/D交换反应，产生所有甲烷同位素异构体的统计分布。它激活环烷烃中的CH键，形成钽环烷基物种。该H/D交换反应的速度大约是烷烃互变异构反应的两数量级快。机制涉及钽氢化物种作为催化循环中的活性中间体，而不是TaCH3物种，这与实验观察一致。使用红外光谱法监测CH4和CD4的消耗以及不同甲烷同位素异构体的形成。
