[1] "Commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes suffer from several limitations, especially: i) ther- modynamic limitations on paraffin conversion; ii) side reactions such as thermal cracking; iii) strongly endothermic reactions to which large amounts of heat must be supplied at temperatures above the reaction temperature; iv) formation of coke on the catalyst which requires frequent regeneration."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation takes place in the presence of an hydrogen acceptor such as molec- ular oxygen in the reaction medium. This process has the potential to overcome the major technical problems associated with pure dehydrogenation."
[3] "Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %"
[4] "The most successful of these catalysts is the Li/ Mg/O one. The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, analogously to that occurring with methane."
[5] "Catalysts for coupling operate at 700- 800C, and the hot outlet stream could be fed to a downstream catalytic or thermal oxydehydrogen- ation reactor."

The oxidative dehydrogenation process, which occurs in the presence of molecular oxygen, has the potential to address the significant technical challenges encountered in traditional dehydrogenation methods. This process can overcome thermodynamic limitations and operate at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction, thus avoiding the necessity for frequent catalyst regeneration. Among the various catalyst types, those based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, particularly the Li/Mg/O system, demonstrate superior performance in ethane oxydehydrogenation, achieving high selectivities and yields to ethylene. This system, which involves C-H heterolytic scission without the requirement for bulk oxygen, allows for the efficient formation of ethyl radicals. The role of Li+O- centers in abstracting hydrogen and generating ethyl radicals is crucial. However, these catalysts experience a progressive loss of lithium at temperatures exceeding 700°C, necessitating their use after a methane coupling reactor to enhance ethylene yield through the oxydehydrogenation of generated ethane. Catalysts designed for coupling typically function at temperatures around 700-800°C, and their hot outlet stream can be directed to a subsequent catalytic or thermal oxydehydrogenation reactor.

氧化脱氢化过程，在反应介质中存在分子氧，具有解决传统脱氢化方法所遇到的重大技术问题的潜力。该过程可以克服热力学限制，并在较低温度下以放热反应进行，从而避免频繁催化剂再生的需要。在各种催化剂类型中，基于IA族和IIA族金属的离子和氧化物，尤其是Li/Mg/O系统，在乙烷氧化脱氢化过程中表现出优异性能，实现高选择性和乙烯产率。该系统涉及不需大量氧气的C-H异裂解，通过类似甲烷的方式形成乙基自由基。Li+O-中心在提取氢原子并生成乙基自由基的过程中起关键作用。然而，这些催化剂在超过700°C的温度下会经历锂的逐渐损失，因此需要在甲烷耦合反应器后使用，以提高通过氧化脱氢化生成的乙烷的产率。用于耦合的催化剂通常在700-800°C工作，其热出口流体可以被引导到后续的催化或热氧化脱氢化反应器中。
