[1] "Commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes suffer from several limitations, especially: i) thermodynamic limitations on paraffin conversion; ii) side reactions such as thermal cracking; iii) strongly endothermic reactions to which large amounts of heat must be supplied at temperatures above the reaction temperature; iv) formation of coke on the catalyst which requires frequent regeneration."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation takes place in the presence of an hydrogen acceptor such as molecular oxygen in the reaction medium. This process has the potential to overcome the major technical problems associated with pure dehydrogenation."
[3] "Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %"
[4] "The most successful of these catalysts is the Li/ Mg/O one. The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, analogously to that occurring with methane."
[5] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10]; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which modifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ]; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decomposition of ethyl radicals to ethylene."
[6] "Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600C are Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, LiC1/MnO2 and LiC1/Sm203. Dopants other than Li + have been reported: SnO2, Na20, lanthanides (mainly CeO2) [ 14]."
[7] "Rare earth oxides are remarkably active [ 12,15 ], and yield ethylene with high productivity and good selectivity. In addition, they exhibit a very high stability even at high temperature."

The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane as an alternative method for producing light olefins. It compares the performance of various catalysts used in this process, highlighting their advantages and limitations. The document also explores the challenges faced by traditional dehydrogenation processes, such as thermodynamic constraints, side reactions, heat supply issues, and catalyst regeneration requirements. It explains how oxidative dehydrogenation can overcome these limitations by operating at low temperatures with an exothermic reaction and avoiding frequent catalyst regeneration. The document provides details on the catalytic systems used for ethane oxydehydrogenation, including those based on Group IA and IIA metals, lithium-magnesium-oxygen catalysts, and transition metal oxides. It also mentions the role of additives like chlorine in enhancing the catalyst's performance and the importance of rare earth oxides in achieving high selectivities and yields to ethylene. The document further discusses the mechanisms of C-H bond activation in these processes, including H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, although these topics are not directly addressed in the provided literature.
