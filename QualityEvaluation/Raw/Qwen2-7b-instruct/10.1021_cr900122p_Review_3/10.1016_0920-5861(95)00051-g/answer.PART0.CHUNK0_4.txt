2.1. Oxydehydrogenation of ethane
Some of the catalysts developed for the reaction of methane coupling are also active in the ethane oxydehydrogenation. In other cases, entirely new catalytic systems have been developed. The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. conversion plot, and the levels of maximum productivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane involves the use of catalysts that can be derived from those used in methane coupling, as well as newly developed systems. The effectiveness of these catalysts is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, which depict the highest yields in terms of selectivity versus conversion, and the peak productivity attained at the typical operating temperature for each system.
