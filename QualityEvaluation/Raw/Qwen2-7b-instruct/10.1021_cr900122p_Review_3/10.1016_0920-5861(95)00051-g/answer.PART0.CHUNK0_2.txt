[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane as an alternative way for the production of light olefins."
[2] "Until recently, light olefins (along with methane and aromatics) have been obtained from steam cracking of natural gas and of naphtha and from FCC in oil refining."
[3] "Commercial processes for the synthesis of light olefins through paraffins dehydrogenation are available, even though their main application is for isobutene synthesis."
[4] "Best catalytic systems for ethane oxydehydrogenation are not the optimal ones for higher paraffins, and vice versa."
[5] "The most successful of these catalysts is the Li/Mg/O one."
[6] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides."
[7] "Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600C are Li2O/TiO2, LiCl/NiO, LiCl/MnO2 and LiCl/Sm2O3."
[8] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon,through a classical redox cycle."
[9] "Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb were shown to be active in ethane oxidation at temperatures as low as 250C, with selectivity to ethylene higher than 80%."
[10] "Alumina-C2. O; I OH favours surface mechanism."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The provided literature does not contain information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, mechanisms in H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, or roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes. Therefore, it is not possible to compare and contrast these topics based on the given data.

提供的文献中没有关于二氧化硅负载的锆化物和氧化铝负载的钍化物的制备、结构、催化性质、H/D交换、烷烃重排的机制、反应速率、选择性，或σ键重排、氢解离和链行走在这些过程中的作用的信息。因此，无法根据给定的数据比较和对比这些主题。
