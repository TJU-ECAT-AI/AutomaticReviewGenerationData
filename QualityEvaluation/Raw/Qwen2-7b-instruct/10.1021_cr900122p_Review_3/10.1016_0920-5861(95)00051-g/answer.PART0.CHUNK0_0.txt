[1] "Commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes suffer from several limitations, especially: i) thermodynamic limitations on paraffin conversion; ii) side reactions such as thermal cracking; iii) strongly endothermic reactions to which large amounts of heat must be supplied at temperatures above the reaction temperature; iv) formation of coke on the catalyst which requires frequent regeneration."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation takes place in the presence of an hydrogen acceptor such as molecular oxygen in the reaction medium."
[3] "Catalysts for coupling operate at 700-800C, and the hot outlet stream could be fed to a downstream catalytic or thermal oxydehydrogenation reactor."
[4] "High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides."
[5] "Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600C are Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, LiC1/MnO2 and LiC1/Sm203. Dopants other than Li + have been reported: SnO2, Na20, lanthanides (mainly CeO2)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation process occurs in the presence of an oxygen acceptor, such as molecular oxygen, in the reaction medium. This process can overcome the major technical issues associated with pure dehydrogenation. However, challenges such as the removal of heat of reaction, control of selectivity due to the formation of unwanted oxygenated by-products and carbon oxides, flammability of the reaction mixtures, and the possibility of runaway reactions arise. Catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation are typically based on Group IA and IIA metals or transition metal oxides, which can activate ethane at temperatures higher than 600°C to form ethyl radicals, which then undergo further gas-phase reactions. High yields of ethylene can be achieved with certain catalysts, particularly when chlorine-containing compounds are added to the reactor or when the catalyst is doped with halides. Catalysts for coupling operate at 700-800°C, and their hot outlet stream can be directed to a downstream catalytic or thermal oxidative dehydrogenation reactor. Various other catalyst systems, including Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, LiC1/MnO2, LiC1/Sm203, and dopants like SnO2, Na20, and lanthanides (mainly CeO2), are also effective at temperatures above 600°C.

氧化脱氢过程在反应介质中存在氧接受体，如分子氧的情况下发生。这个过程可以克服纯脱氢过程的主要技术问题。然而，去除反应热、控制由于形成不希望的氧化副产品和二氧化碳而导致的选择性降低、反应混合物的可燃性、以及反应失控的可能性等挑战随之出现。用于乙烷脱氢的催化剂通常基于第IA族和IIA族金属或过渡金属氧化物，它们可以在高于600°C的温度下激活乙烷，形成乙基自由基，然后进一步在气相中反应。在某些催化剂中，通过添加氯化物化合物到反应器或对催化剂进行卤化，可以实现高乙烯产率。耦合催化剂在700-800°C下工作，并且其热出口流可以导向下游的催化或热氧化脱氢反应器。其他有效的工作温度高于600°C的催化剂系统包括Li20/TiO2、LiC1/NiO、LiC1/MnO2、LiC1/Sm203，以及诸如SnO2、Na20和镧系元素（主要是CeO2）的掺杂剂。
