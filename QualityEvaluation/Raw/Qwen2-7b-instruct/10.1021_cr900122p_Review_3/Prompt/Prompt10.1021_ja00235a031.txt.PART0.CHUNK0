Bond Metathesis for C-H Bonds of Hydrocarbons and Sc-R (R = H, alkyl, aryl) Bonds of Permethylscandocene Derivatives. Evidence for Noninvolvement of the 7r System in Electrophilic Activation of Aromatic and Vinylic C-H Bonds Mark E. Thompson, Steven M. Baxter, A. Ray Bulls, Barbara J. Burger, Michael C. Nolan, Bernard D. Santarsiero, William P. Schaefer, and John E. Bercaw* Contribution No. 7436 from the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91 125. Received July 9, 1986 Abstract: A new class of coordinatively unsaturated, monomeric organoscandium compounds, Cp*,Sc-R (Cp* = ($-CjMej); R = halide, hydride, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl), has been prepared. Cp*,Sc-CI is obtained from reaction of ScC13(THF),(THF = tetrahydrofuran) with LiCp*, and Cp*,Sc-R (R = CHj, C6H5,
C6H4CH3,
CH,C6H5) from treatment of CP*SC-CI with the appropriate organoalkali reagent. These organoscandium compounds react with dihydrogen rapidly to yield R-H and CP*SC-H.
The tetrahydrofuran adducts Cp*,ScX(THF) (X = CI, H, CH3) are obtained upon treatment of Cp*,Sc-X with tetrahydrofuran. Rapid exchange of dihydrogen with the hydride ligands of CP*SC-H and CP*SCH(THF) occurs even at low temperatures. Other alkyl derivatives may be conveniently prepared by treatment of Cp*,Sc-H (or Cp*,ScH(THF)) with a-olefins, e.g., Cp*,ScCH,CH, from CP*SC-H and ethylene. Allene and Cp*,Sc-H afford Cp*,Sc(v3-C3H,). CP*SC-R (R = H, CH,, aryl) reacts with pyridine to yield Cp*,Sc(C, N-a2-CjH4N),which crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pna2, (a = 16.297 (4) A, b = 9.684 (3) A, c = 14.486 (6) A, V = 2286.3 (12) A), Z = 4). Least-squares refinement led to a goodness-of-fit of I .74 for 1128 reflections and a value for R of 0.0362 ( I  > 3u, 944 reflections). Spectroscopic and crystallographic data for Cp*,Sc-CH3 and Cp*,Sc-CH2CH3 indicate that the methyl ligand is bonded in a conventional (Le.,undistorted) manner, while the ethyl ligand likely participates in a p C-H to Sc agostic interaction. Cp*,Sc-CH3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P2,2,2, (a = 8.502 (2) A, b = 11.095 (4) A, c = 21.554 (7) A, V = 2033.2 (1 1) A3,
Z =
4). J-east-squares refinement led to a value for R of 0.072 (
F
:> 3u(F:),1143 reflections). H/D exchange between H,,arenes, and the primary and secondary C-H bonds of alkanes is catalyzed by Cp*,Sc-H and Cp*,ScH(THF). In benzene solution Cp*,Sc-H, Cp*,Sc-C6H5, and Hz are in equilibrium (AH = 6.7 (3) kcal.rnol-, ASo = 1.5 (1) eu), indicating that the bond dissociation energy of the Sc-H bond for Cp*,Sc-H is 1.5 (4) kcal.mol- higher than the bond dissociation energy of the Sc-C bond for Cp*,Sc-C6H5. Cp*,ScH(THF) 1s also in equilibrium with H,, Cp*,Sc-C6Hj, and THF in benzene solution (AH = 18.9 (8) kcal-mol-,, AS = 25 (2) eu). Cp*zSc-CH3 reacts with a range of hydrocarbons (R-H), activating their C-H bonds to afford methane and Cp*,Sc-R (R-H = I3CH4,arenes, styrenes, alkynes). The reaction of Cp*,Sc-CH3 with styrenes is characterized by a moderate enthalpy of activation (AH* = 12 kcal.mo1-l) and a large negative entropy of activation (AS* -36 eu). A kinetic deuterium isotope effect ( k  / k = 2.8 (2)) is observed for the reaction of (Cp*-d,j),Sc-CH3 with c6Y6 (Y = H,D) at 80 C. Very small differences in the rates of vinylic C-H bond activation for (p-C6H,X)CH=CH2 (X = CF,, OCH,) and aryl C-H bonds of C6HjX (X = CF3, H, CH,, N(CH,),) as well as the positional nonselectivity for activation of the meta and para C-H bonds of toluene indicate that the scandium center does not interact substantially with the x system of these substrates in the transition states for these reactions. Thus, for these sterically encumbered organoscandium compounds, sp2-hybridized C-H bonds are activated without formation of a x complex; rather, the electrophilic scandium center directly attacks the C-H u bond. A general mechanism for these reactions with C-H and H-H bonds (Cp*,Sc-R + R-H z Cp*,Sc-R + R-H), termed u bond metathesis, is proposed, which accounts for the systematic decrease in rate with decreasing s character of the reacting u bonds (R = R = H > > R = alkyl, R = H > > R = alkyl, R = sp C-H > R = alkyl, R = sp2 C-H > R = alkyl, R = sp3 C-H). Both alkyl exchange {Cp*,Sc-R + R-I 2 Cp*,Sc-R + R-I (R =
CH3,
R = I3CHj;
R = CH2CH3,
R = CH,)] and alkyl coupling (Cp*$c-R + R-X 2 Cp*,Sc-X + R-R (R = R = CH,, X = I; R = CH3, R = CH,C,H,, X = CI, Br)) are observed in the reactions of Cp*,Sc-R with alkyl halides.
The activation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is a conspicuous challenge that has been actively pursued in recent years., It is now generally recognized that there are two fundamentally different mechanisms for cleaving carbon-hydrogen bonds with transition-metal (or f-element) compounds: (i) oxidative addition to an extremely reactive electron-rich, coordinatively unsaturated metal center and (ii) -
L,M-R
+ R-ti ( 1 ) Ln-R  - (R,R = H, alkyl, alkenyl. aryl, alkynyl) heterolytic cleavage by a coordinatively unsaturated, electron- deficient and, hence, highly electrophilic metal center. The latter process typically utilizes do (or doP) metals and is usually pictured as involving a highly charged, four-center transition state with metal abstracting carbanion and the leaving group effecting proton abstraction (eq I ). This picture closely resembles that established by Halpern2c*3 for heterolytic activation of dihydrogen in aqueous solution.

A curious feature of both types of C-H bond activating systems is that, despite their higher bond strengths, arene (sp2-hybridized) C-H bonds are more reactive than aliphatic (sp3-hybridized) C-H bonds. Initial formation of a 7r complex has been proposed to explain the greater reactivity of arenes for systems which oxi- datively add C-H bonds, and, indeed, Jones and Feher4 have developed a convincing case for an q2-arene adduct of [Cp*- (PMe3)Rh] (Cp* = $-CjMej) mediating the reaction leading to the aryl-hydride p r o d  c t .

Presumably, KCH2C6H5 is sufficiently potent to react even with Cp*2ScCl(THF). activating systems, initial attack at the carbon p a  orbital (cf. electrophilic aromatic substitution) could be invoked to explain the higher reactivity of arene C-H bonds with CP*,SCR, Cp*,LnR(Ln = Y, lanthanide),' and Cp*,ThR2.* We report herein synthetic and structural studies of hydride and hydrocarbyl derivatives of permethylscandocene, together with investigations of their reactivities with H, and hydrocarbons.Experiments designed to probe the mechanisms of these processes have been carried out, and the possibility of involvement of the a system in electrophilic activation of aromatic and vinylic C-H bonds has been examined. A picture of the transition state for such "u-bond metathesis" reactions' is developed, which accounts for the relative reactivities of sp-, sp2-, and sp3-hybridized C-H bonds with Cp*,Sc-R (R = H, alkyl, aryl).Results and Discussion Synthesis of Alkyl, Allyl, Aryl, and Hydride Derivatives of Permethylscandocene. A useful starting material for the synthesis of a variety of derivatives of permethylscandocene is the chloride complex, Cp*,ScCl (1). Compound 1 is obtained, together with its T H F  adduct (THF = tetrahydrofuran), when solvent is re- moved from a reaction mixture consisting of ScC13(THF), and 2 equiv of LiCp*, which has been heated at reflux for 3 days in xylenes (eq 2). The coordinated THF is removed on sublimation of the residue under dynamic vacuum, affording pale yellow,crystalline 1 (eq 3). A solution molecular weight determination ScCl,.(THF), + 2LiCp* -

By contrast, [(q5-C5H5),ScCIJ2 is a robust dimer with the two chloride ligands bridging scandium centers.1 Moreover, (v5- C5H5),ScC1(THF) does not dissociate its T H F  ligand on subli- mation.]' Both of these differences are undoubtedly attributable to the much greater steric bulk of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand for 1.Cp*,ScCI readily undergoes straightforward12 metathetical reactions with main group organometallic compounds. Thus, Cp*2Sc(m-C6H4CH3) ( m - 4 ,and Cp*,Sc(p-C6H4CH3) @-4) are obtained by treatment of 1 with the appropriate organolithium compound. The choice of solvent is sometimes critical (see Ex- perimental Section). THF is particularly deleterious, since none of the above transformations occur in the presence of as little as 1 equiv of tetrahydrofuran; Cp*,ScCI(THF) is recovered from the reaction mixture. One alkyl derivative, Cp*2ScCH2C6H5 (5),can be prepared, however, even in 1:l THF-toluene (eq 4).Cp*,ScCH, (2), CP*,SCCHS

These 14-electron hydrocarbyl derivatives of permethyl- scandocene have very crowded coordination spheres, as illustrated by their resistance to aggregation in solution and their poor af- finities for bases. Like 1, compounds 2,3,4, and 5 are monomeric in benzene solution. Neither trimethylphosphine nor tertiary amines form adducts with any of the above complexes. Moreover,while the phenyl, tolyl, and benzyl derivatives do not form de- tectable concentrations of THF adducts ('H NMR), Cp*,ScCH3 (2) coordinates THF tightly enough to allow crystallization of analytically pure samples of Cp*2ScCH3(THF),even in the ab- sence of excess THF, illustrating the delicate balance betwen steric and electronic factors for these permethylscandocene complexes.The 'H NMR spectrum of 5 is consistent with an vl-(rather than v3-) coordination of benzyl to Sc: a simple A2B2C phenyl pattern is observed, even at -90 OC. While an v3-(allyl-like) structure cannot be excluded, these ' H  NMR data indicate an upper limit of ca. 10 kcalmol-I for dissociation of the C=C K bond, if, in Each o ? these hydrocarbyl derivatives reacts rapidly with di- hydrogen to afford R H  and a single permethylscandocene com- pound, assigned the formula [Cp*,ScH], on the basis of the data given below (eq 5). This scandium hydride is rather unstable (5)

under reduced dihydrogen pressures, decomposing in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents to as yet unidentified products. When several atmospheres of dihydrogen are maintained over the solution,however, 6 is quite robust. After heating to 150 OC for over a week in benzene under 4 atm H2 there is no sign of decomposition.
Although the kinetics of these reactions have not been examined in detail, a half-life of ca. 5 min is observed for the reaction of Cp*&CH3 (2) with H2 (2 atm) at -78 O
C
in toluene (vide infra).
The characterization of unstable [Cp*,ScH],, (6) is based on the following: (i) for R = CH2C6H5 in reaction 5, 0.93 equiv of dihydrogen is consumed (Toepler pump analysis), and 1 .O equiv of CH3C6H5 ('H NMR) is formed; (ii) treatment with excess methyl iodide yields CP*SCI and CH,; (iii) when reaction 5 is carried out in the presence of at least 1 equiv of THF, a more stable THF adduct of 6 is obtained (eq 6). While CP*SCH-
THF
Cp*2Sc-R + H2 - Cp*,ScH(THF) + R-H (6) 2-5 7 (THF) does decompose slowly over a period of several days at room temperature, it appears to be indefinitely stable when stored in the dark at -10 "C. Solution molecular weight determinations for 7 show it to be monomeric. Like 6, Cp*,ScH(THF) reacts rapidly with CH31 to afford methane, and, in this case Cp*2ScI(THF). Infrared spectra reveal a rather low frequency for u(Sc-H) at 1390 cm-I, which shifts on deuteriation (vide infra) to 990 cm-I.
Solutions of Cp*,ScH catalyze rapid H/D exchange between
H2
and D2 (eq 7 ) .  Furthermore, the room temperature 'H NMR spectrum of a methylcyclohexane-d,, solution of Cp*,ScH under 4 atm H2 shows only a single resonance for the (q5-C5Me5) protons;resonances for ScH and H2 are not discernible. Failure to observe [CP*&Hl

(7) these signals could be due to broadening of the hydride resonance by the strong quadrupolar 45Sc nucleus (1 00% abundance, I = c Bond Metathesis for Hydrocarbons

C
a broad peak at 6 6.1 (full width at half height (fwhh) = 26 Hz) is observed. This new signal must be an average resonance for ScH and dissolved H2,since the signal for dihydrogen at 6 4.5 (methylcyclohexane-dI4) is not observed.
This averaging process (eq 8) is very fast even at lower temper- fast Cp*,Sc-H + H-H Cp*,Sc-H + H-H (8) 6 6 atures; at -80 O
C
a single resonance at 6 6.2 (fwhh = 32 Hz) is observed, whereas in tohene-d8 at -95 "c a similar resonance appears at 6 6.65 (fwhh = 33 Hz). From the estimated con- centrations of dihydrogen and [6] in toluene, the simple weighted average chemical shift of 6 7.3 (3) in t0h1ene-d (-95 "C) is alculated' for Cp*,ScH.Coordination of THF slows exchange of Sc-H with H2. Thus,in addition to resonances for (q5-CsMe5) and a- and P-hydrogens of coordinated T H F  (Table I), a toluene-d, solution of Cp*,ScH(THF) (7) under 4 atm H, at -90 "C exhibits a broad resonance at 6 4.8 (fwhh = 18 Hz), attributable to Sc-H, and a sharp signal due to dissolved H2 at 6 4.5. Above ca. -20 "C these two signals collapse to a single broad resonance. Addition of I O  equiv of T H F  raises the coalescence temperature to 0 "C,suggesting that exchange between Cp*,ScH(THF) and H, is preceded by dissociation of THF from 7, Le., exchange occurs via Cp*,ScH (6).
Although 6 is of only marginal stability, it is, nonetheless, a valuable synthetic reagent when generated in situ. Olefins readily insert into the scandium-hydride bond, affording alkyl complexes (eq 9). It is important that these reactions be carried out at -80 "C to avoid other reactions (vida infra). With allene smooth conversion to Cp*,Sc(q3-C3HS) (10) occurs (eq 10). Variable

The reaction of 6 with pyridine presumably proceeds via an adduct, Cp*,ScH(NC5H5),analogous to 7. Indeed, treatment of 11 with D, leads to specific deuteration of the ortho position, indicative of the reversible reaction shown in eq 11. In the reaction of Cp*,ScCH3 with pyridine, an in-

Structure and Bonding of Cp*,ScCH3 and Cp*,ScCH2CH3.
Alkyl derivatives of permethylscandocene are formally 14-electron compounds and, hence, are very electron deficient. In the absence of overriding steric interactions, Lewis bases bind strongly to scandium, by using one of the two low-lying, vacant orbitals (e.g., Cp*,ScCH3(THF) and Cp*,Sc(C, N-q2-C5H4N)).

C,-C,
angle shown below, a larger C-H coupling constant (vis-a-vis Cp*,ScCH,), like that for cyclopropane ('JC_H = 161 Hz) or cyclobutane ( ' J c - = 134 Hz), may be anticipated. The 'Jc(+H of 117 HZ for Cp*,ScCH,CH,CH,, which does not exhibit low frequency u(C-H) bands, suggests that an abnormally large 13Ca-H coupling constant may signal a P agostic structure.20 Obviously, X-ray diffraction studies of the structures of
CP*SCCH,
and Cp*2ScCH2CH3 could settle these questions.
Single crystals of both 2 and 8 have been obtained, and the crystal structures of the two compounds have been determined. In spite of high-quality data, it was not possible to locate the hydrogen atoms of the -CH3 group for 2 or even the carbon atoms of the -CH2CH3 group for 8 with any precision: severe disorder in the ($-CsMe5) rings in both compounds wiped out our resolution in the rest of the molecule as well. The X-ray results for 2 do provide some evidence that the CH3 group does not have an agostic in- teraction with the scandium, however, since the methyl carbon is found in the plane defined by the scandium atom and the centroids of the two ($-C5Me5) ligands. An agostic interaction with one (or two, but not necessarily threelsd) C-H bond(s) would distort the carbon atom of this plane to one side. Since the methyl carbon is contained in this plane, within experimental error, we conclude that the Sc-CH, bonding is probably "conventional".
It should be noted, however, a nearly symmetric18d,21 distortion to decrease the Sc-C-H angles could also be consistent with these X-ray structural data.
We are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the structure of Cp*,ScCH,CH, (8),however, because the ethyl group as well as ($-C5Me5) ligands are disordered. The two carbon atoms are poorly defined and do not refine well; at best we can say they appear equidistant from the scandium atom. Such a geometry is compatible with an agostic interaction of a P-C-H bond, but the X-ray evidence is certainly not definitive.
The geometry of Cp*,ScCH3 (2) is normal. The Sc-CH,distance is 2.24 (1) and the average Sc-C(Cp*) distance is 2.46
(1) A.
Comparisons can be made with the structure of [Cp*2LuCH3]2,in which there are three Lu-CH, bond distances:one terminal at 2.344 (12) A and two for the bridging CH, group,
2.440 (9) and 2.756 (9) A.22 The Sc-CH, bond length we observe
is therefore reasonable by comparison to these Lu-CH, bond lengths, when differences in ionic radii (0.12 A) for Lu(II1) and Sc(II1) are considered. The cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms of 2 are planar, within experimental error, with the methyl groups nearly in the same plane. The ring C-C distances range from
1.284 (18)
to 1.463 (15) A, with an average of 1.36 (6) A; the ring methyl-carbon distances range from 1.425 (24) to 1.601 (20) 8 ,
with an average of 1.50 ( 5 )  A. Because of large Uij's in the (q5-C5Me5) groups, these latter distances are highly imprecise.H/D Exchange Reactions Catalyzed by Cp*,ScH ( 6 )  and Cp*,ScH(THF) (7). Permethylscandocene hydride derivatives catalyze H/D exchange for a variety of C-H bonds. As with other catalysts,23 H/D exchange is rapid for arenes. Exchange between Cp*,Sc-H and the aryl or methyl C-D bonds of toluene-d8 is slow at -80 'C, but at room temperature exchange between Cp*,Sc-D and C6H6 is >95% complete within 5 min as shown in eq 13. The (20) Admittedly, these differences in C,-H coupling constant are rather small for the permethylscandocene series (Cp'zSc-R, R = CH, ( I  11 Hz),
CH2CH3
(122 Hz), CH,CH2CH3 (117 Hz)J,so that caution should be ex- ercised in extrapolating from these results. The lack of an agostic 6 C-H interaction with scandium for Cp*,ScCH2CHZCH3 may be attributed to an unfavorable steric interaction of the C, methyl group with a pentamethyl- cyclopentadienyl group which is imposed upon coordination of a fl C-H bond.

Figure 2. ORTEP drawing of Cp*,Sc-CH,. exhibits a doublet for Sc-CH, with lJC-H = 11 1 Hz.The 'H NMR spectrum of Cp*,ScCH2CH3 (8) exhibits a simple first-order pattern for Sc-CH2CH3 with 3JH-H = 6.8 Hz.Interestingly, the I3C-H coupling constant for the methylene group is significantly larger than might be expected (vida infra) from the arguments presented above: lJC(a)-H = 122 Hz, whereas Since agostic structures are commonly fluxional, with terminal and bridging hydrogens undergoing rapid exchange (averaging chemical shifts and  J c -  ' s ) ,'H N M R  data for the perprotio derivatives are often inconclusive in differentiating agostic and conventional structures.'' Partial deuteriation of the suspected bridging position can produce significantly different 'H chemical shifts and 'JC_"s, as compared to the perprotio compounds;however, in some cases these effects have been found to be small for both (Y and (3 agostic structures.18C The 'H chemical shift difference between Cp*,ScCH, and Cp*,ScCH2D amounts to only
0.057 ppm (cf., 0.047 ppm for Cp*,ScCH,(THF)

Cp*,ScCH,D(THF); 0.020 ppm for ($-C5H5)2W(CH3)2 vs.
(5-C5H5)2W(CH2D)2;
0.010 ppm for CH, vs. CH,D). Although
the difference between CP*SCCH,and Cp*,ScCH,D is the largest in the series, these data are, at best, inconclusive evidence for an (Y agostic structure for 2. Comparison of the NMR data for C*,SC'CH,'CH,D and C  * , S C '  C H , '  C H reveals a somewhat larger 'H chemical shift difference of 0.090 ppm (0.049 vs. 0.139) for the methyl group upon monodeuteration, but the
'JC(B)-H
value of 120 Hz for C*,SC'CH,'CH,D is unchanged from that for C*,SC'CH,'CH,.Thus, these data must also be viewed as rather inconclusive as regards the structure of 8.
'JC(,+H
= 120 Hz. / 8 Infrared data have also been used as diagnostic for agostic interactions, since the bridging hydrogen often exhibits a low frequency "u(C-H)"." No bands in the region 1600-2700 cm-' are observed in the infrared spectrum of Cp*,ScCH, (see Figure 2). Moreover, Cp*,ScCD, exhibits two u(C-D) bands at 2195 and 2152 cm-' (cf. u(C-D) = 2160, 2140 cm-' for CDJ). By contrast, three prominent, low frequency u(C-H) bands at 2593,2503, and 2440 cm-' are noted for Cp*,ScCH2CH3 (Figure 2).These infrared data for 8 strongly suggest a fi agostic structure.Thus, despite the inconclusive 'H NMR results, we presently favor an agostic structure for 8. It should be noted that, although a (3 agostic structure for (Me2PCH2CH2PMe,)C1,TiCH,CH, has u Bond Metathesis for Hydrocarbons complementary reaction, 6 + C6D6 + CH,I, yields Cp*,ScI,

and CH3D (only). An upper limit of ca. 100 s is thus established for the half life of the exchange reaction at 25 "C ( k > ca. IO-, s-I.M-').

(13) H/D exchange for CP*SCH(THF) (7) and benzene-d6 is much slower.
After 1.5 h at 25 "C, treatment of a solution of Cp*,Sc-H(THF) in C6D6 with excess CH31 yields only CH4(<5% CH,D, k < ca. s-'.M-' at 25 "C). Onset of exchange occurs at elevated temperatures (>50 "C), but like exchange with H2 (vida supra), dissociation of the THF ligand very likely precedes reaction of 7 with benzene.
With toluene the progress of H / D  exchange was monitored by IH NMR spectroscopy. Multiple exchanges are achieved by treating toluene-d, with Cp*,Sc-H and H, (4 atm) in a sealed NMR tube (eq 14). The positional preference (ortho, meta, para,[Cp*2Sc-H] H2 (4 atrn) toluene-d8 - toluene-d,(14) CH,) is of particular interest as regards the mechanism of ex- change (vida infra). After 2-3 turnovers the meta and para positions show roughly equal extents of proton incorporation,exchange into the ortho positions being much slower. An un- changing ratio (39:4 1 :20) of integrations, 0rtho:meta:para ('H NMR, 500 MHz), is obtained after 48 h at 80 "C. Hydrogen incorporation into the methyl group occurs at a rate 60-70 times slower than for the aryl positions. On prolonged heating the amount of hydrogen in the methyl position gradually increases,eventually equilibrating at an aryhethyl ratio of 5.0:4.0 (slightly less than statistical incorporation of H in the aryl and hence slightly greater incorporation of D in the aryl positions relative to the methyl positions, as expected on the basis of the relative zero-point energy differences), The relative amounts of hydrogen incorpo- rated among the aryl positions does not change.
A series of substrates was examined for H / D  exchange with Cp*,Sc-D by using 'H NMR spectroscopy. In order to effect extensive deuteration of the C-H positions of these substrates, Cp*,Sc-D and excess substrate were dissolved in benzene-d6 under 4 atm of D,. The pool of deuterium in the solvent thus serves as the principal source for exchange, since reaction of Cp*,Sc-H with benzene-d6 and D, is considerably faster than H/D exchange with substrates (eq 15-17). Under these conditions 6 is thermally very fast Cp*,Sc-H + D, Cp*,Sc-D + HD (1 5) 6 6-d1 fast Cp* SC-H + C6D.5 Cp* SC-D + C6D5H (16) b 6- dl slow Cp* SC-D + R-H Cp* SC-H + R-D (17) &d,i quite stable. By using this standard procedure, intramolecular H/D exchange is observed for the methyl groups of the ($-C5Me5) ligands of 6 (ca. 2 turnovers&' at 80 "C) and for the a-C-H positions of the T H F  ligand and the methyl positions of the (q5-C5Me5) ligands for 7 (h at 80 "C); the P-C-H positions of the THF ligand remain unreactive even after several days at this temperature. In light of the reactivity of Cp*,ScH with pyridine (eq 1 1 and 12), the a-C-H bonds of the T H F  almost certainly react reversibly and intramolecularly with the Sc-D bond of 7.
Moreover, free and coordinated THF are in rapid equilibrium so that 7 acts as a catalyst for the selective a-deuteration of THF.
Intermolecular H/D exchange is observed for the primary C-H bonds of a variety of molecules. In addition to the methyl group of toluene (vida supra), a moderate rate of H/D exchange is noted for CH4, Si(CH3)4,
P(CH3)3,21
and remarkably, at 80 "C for only the methyl groups of propane. Cp*,ScH(THF) (7) also catalyzes these H / D  exchange reactions; however, in all cases the rates are Table 1 1 .

Thus, incorporation of deuterium occurs in a one-at-a-time manner, in contrast to H/D exchange catalysts based on [PtC14]2-2S and zirconium a l k  x i d e s ,which have been reported to effect multiple deuterations per interaction with the catalyst.
Hydrogen/deuterium exchange is also observed for 2 '

bonds, but the rates are generally very slow compared with in- tramolecular exchange or intermolecular exchange with 1 " or aryl C-H bonds. For example, a rate of only 0.06 turnovers-h-I at 120 "C is observed for yclopentane.
The large difference in the rates of 1" vs. 2" C-H exchange suggests that this catalyst system may be used generally in the synthesis of aliphatic hydrocarbons with only primary deuteriation ( e g , CD3(CH,),CD3) or aromatic hydrocarbons with only 1' and aryl deuteriation (e.g.,
CD3CH2C6D5).
Moreover, the low rates of 2" C-H bond acti- vation may be used to advantage in providing inert solvents ( e g ,cyclohexane and cyclooctane) for the mechanistic studies described in the next sections. The C-H bonds of cyclopropane are ex- ceptionally reactive and are readily exchanged under the standard reaction conditions described above, at a rate comparable to methane and tetramethylsilane; no ring opening is apparent under these conditions.
The qualitative scale of reactivity toward H/D exchange shown below clearly indicates that sterics (and s character of the C-H bond, vida infra) correlate more closely with reactivity than does the C-H bond dissociation energy of the substrate: decreasing rate of H I D  exchange with Cp*,Sc-D -

if isolation of Cp*,ScH, prepared in benzene solution (for example,by hydrogenation of Cp*,ScCH3), is attempted by removing the benzene in vacuo, the product obtained is largely Cp*,ScC6H5,together with minor amounts of 6. Dissolution of this product mixture in benzene, followed by admission of 1 atm of H,, drives the equilibrium almost completely back to 6 ('H NMR).Measureable concentrations of both 3 and 6 in benzene solution are obtained by dissolving 6 in benzene in a sealed NMR tube.The determination of the concentration of dihydrogen in solution using 'H NMR spectroscopy is, of course, not possible, since exchange with the hydride ligand of 6 is rapid, and the 45Sc quadrupolar broadening obscures the average signal. The con- centration of Hz may be calculated, however, by assuming the (24) The molecularity of the H/D exchange with PMe, has not been determined. Detectable concentrations of a PMe, adduct of 6 do not build up, even in the presence of several equivalents of phosphine (presumably due to unfavorable steric interactions with the bulky Cp' ligands); however, H/D exchange with the methyl groups of PMe, is faster than with the methyl groups of the ($-C,Me,) ligands of 6 and faster than exchange with the 1' C-H positions of hydrocarbons. 210 J.

The small value of ASo for equilibrium 18, although not entirely expected for an equilibrium involving reagents both in solution and in the gas phase, supports the assumptions of othersz8 that the free energy change accompanying an equilibrium is a good approximation of the enthalpy change and thus useful in estimating relative bond dissociation energies (BDEs). For equilibrium 18,the relative Sc-H and Sc-C,H, BDEs may be estimated from the C-H bond strength for benzene (1 10.9 k  a b m o l - ' ) and the (25) Shilov, A. E. Pure Appl. Chem. 1978, 50, 725.

These results are indicative of competitive bimolecular reaction of benzene-d6 with 2 to yield CH3D and Cp*,ScC6D5 (3-ds) and intramolecular decomposition of 2 to CH4 and 12,followed by faster reaction (eq 22) of 12 with benzene-d, to yield Cp*(cp*-dl)SCC6D (3-d6) as shown in eq 24.

The mechanism for the former is discussed in the following section.
With regard to the latter, examination of the kinetics for the decomposition of 2 to 12 in an inert solvent (e.g., cyclohexane) under a variety of conditions revealed the following complications:(i) whereas different starting concentrations of 2 in cyclohexane-dI2 produce similar initial rates of decomposition (k i= 6 (1) X lo-,s -
I
) ,
nonlinear, autocatalytic behavior is observed, with the final rate of decomposition typically quadrupling the initial rate; (ii) rate acceleration accompanies precipitation of microcrystalline 12; (iii) addition of small amounts of nearly insoluble 12 produces a greater initial rate of decomposition of 2, but nonlinear first-order plots are still obtained; (iv) Toepler pump measurements after complete conversion of 2 to 12 indicate only 0.80 equiv of methane are evolved. In view of the unknown structure of 12 and the complications encountered in studying the mechanism(s) of its formation, the ($-C5Me5) ligands of 2 have been deuteriated (via treatment of Cp*,ScH with several portions of excess benzene-d6 under D2 at 125 "C, conversion to 1 with CHIC],, and treatment of l-dj0 with LiCH3) to minimize this side reaction in the mechanistic studies presented in the following section. Although (Cp*-dlS),ScCH3 shows the same complex kinetic behavior in decomposing to CH3D and 12-d29,a moderate kinetic deuterium isotope effect ( k  / k = 1.6 (2)) for the initial rates of decom- position obtains.

Ethylene is rapidly polymerized by alkyl and aryl derivatives of permethylsandocene;however, u bond metathesis rather than olefin insertion commonly occurs with substituted olefins.
For example, Cp*,ScCH3 (2) reacts readily with p-methylstyrene in cylohexane-d,to afford US-C*SCCH=CHC,HCH (13) (eq 27).

(CF3)C6H4CH=CH2)
were examined to establish the effect of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the rate of vinylic C-H bond metathesis with Cp*,Sc-CH3 (2). Con- venient rates at 40-70 "C are obtained, it the reaction is conducted with [2] i= 0.1 M in benzene-d, and 2-4 molar equiv of styrene.
Good fits to second-order plots were obtained in both cases.4o Measurements over a ca. 40 "C range provide the second-order rate constants and activation parameters shown in Table IV. The difference in the rate between the electron-rich and electron-poor styrenes is insignificant, being barely outside the limits of un- certainty. The activation parameters are also revealing, partic- ularly the very large, negative entropies of activation observed.
Thus, the reaction of Cp*,ScCH3 with the vinylic C-H bond of styrene is characterized as having a rather small enthalpy of (35) Gol'dehleger, N. F.; Tybain, M. B.; Shilov, A. E.; Shteinman, A.

(38) The rates of reaction of Cpt2MCH3 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) with methane are sufficiently slow so that involvement of the ($-C,Me,) C-H bonds (i,e.,intermediate tuck-in species) appears likely, at least in part. Indeed, Watson has commented on a competitive bimolecular and unimolecular nature of these reactions for = Y, Lu (ref 7a). With scandium, a set of parallel pathways analogous to the reaction of 2 with benzene (eq 24) appears likely. terscience: New York, New York, 1981; pp 22-26.

In order to ascertain whether the propenyl derivative, trans-Cp*,ScCH=CHMe (15),is indeed the kinetic product of reaction 29, Le., to exclude the possibility that the allyl complex 10 is initially generated but rearranges rapidly to more stable 15, C P *  S C (   - C  H  ) (10) was subjected to the reaction conaitions for extended periods. No interconversion of 10 and 15 was found, thus confirming that vinylic C-H bond activation is kinetically preferred.
While vinylic carbon-hydrogen bonds are more reactive than aryl C-H bonds, the much higher reactivity of the terminal C-H bonds of alkynes is striking. For example, Cp*,ScCH3 (2) reacts rapidly with propyne to afford methane and the propynyl complex Cp*,ScC=CCH3 (16), even at low temperatures (eq 30).
Compound 16 efficiently and selectively catalyzes the dimerization of propyne to the gem-enyne CH2=C(CH3)CzCCH3 (eq 31). <o o c

A likely mechanism, sequential u bond metathesis and alkyne insertion into Sc-propynyl bonds, is given in eq 32 and 33. In- sertion of alkynes into scandium-carbon bonds is, indeed observed with internal acetylenes, e.g., for 2 and 2-butyne (eq 34).
