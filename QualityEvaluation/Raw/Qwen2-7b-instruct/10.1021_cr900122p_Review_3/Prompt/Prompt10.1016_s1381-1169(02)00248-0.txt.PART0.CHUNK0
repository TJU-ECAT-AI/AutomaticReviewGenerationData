These materials have the empirical formula ( SiO)2M=CHEMe3,where M is Ti, V, or Cr and E is C or Si, incorporating two covalent interactions with oxygens of the silica surface which serve to immobilize the grafted complexes. The silica-supported alkylidene complexes undergo several typical reactions, including electrophilic cleavage with H+ and Br2, metathetical exchange with acetone and styrene, and addition of a silane. Reaction with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, for which the material with M = Cr is particularly effective.

1. Introduction
Many examples of alkylidene ligands bound to high-valent complexes of Mo, W, Ta and Nb are extant in the literature, and a large number have been char- acterized by X-ray diffraction as well as spectroscopy [1,2]. Alkylidene complexes of other transition met- als, while not isolated, are believed to be formed in situ during activation of inorganic catalyst precursors with alkylating agents. The utility of well-defined complexes has been extensively demonstrated in the polymerization of alkynes [3], metathesis polymer- ization of alkenes [4], and olefination of ketones [3].

The demonstration of the alkylidene ligand as an active site for olefin activation has led to wide accep- tance of the Chauvin mechanism for olefin metathesis [5]. There are also intriguing possibilities for the participation of alkylidene ligands in ZieglerNatta polymerization [6], although evidence for such sys- tems is scarce [7]. The formation of alkylidene lig- ands on heterogeneous catalysts used for metathesis (oxide-supported Mo, W or Re) [8,9] and polymeriza- tion (oxide-supported Cr) [10,11] has been suggested,although in most cases such ligands are difficult to detect since the fraction of active sites is very low,typically 1% [12].
One versatile route to molecular alkylidene com- plexes is thermally-induced -H abstraction from a bis(alkyl) complex [2,1315]. During our investiga- tion of bis(alkyl) complexes of Ti(IV), V(IV) and 1381-1169/02/$  see front matter  2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Cr(IV) supported by silica as a ligand, we discov- ered such a family of -H abstraction reactions. They give rise to stable terminal alkylidene complexes, rare in the first-row transition series, which undergo re- actions characteristic of high-valent molecular alkyli- dene complexes of their heavier congeners, as well as some which are less well-documented in solution but which are potentially relevant to mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis, such as initiation of olefin oligomerization and polymerization.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Preparation and characterization of
silica-supported bis(alkyl) metal complexes The homoleptic metal alkyls MR4 (where M is Ti or Cr and R is CH2CMe3; M is V or Cr and R is CH2SiMe3) react at room temperature with the hy- droxyl groups present on the surface of a non-porous Aerosil silica partially dehydroxylated at 200 C.
The resulting material contains alkylmetal fragments grafted onto the silica surface, as shown by their in situ IR spectrum, seen for M = Cr and R = CH2CMe3 in Fig. 1A and B (curve a). The appearance of vibra- tions characteristic of the hydrocarbon modes of the organic ligands is accompanied by the disappearance of the band at 3747 cm1 assigned to the Î½(OH) vi- bration of mutually non-interacting surface hydroxyl groups, designated SiOH. At the same time, RH is liberated into the gas phase, where it was confirmed to be the sole volatile product of the reaction. The surface-modified silicas acquire colors characteristic of their grafted organometallic fragments, viz. yellow,green and orange for M = Ti, V and Cr, respectively.
When the experiment is performed as a gassolid reaction in which the organometallic complex is sub- limed in vacuo onto a silica powder or self-supporting disk, the reaction occurs with a well-defined and re- producible stoichiometry (Table 1). The amount of protonated ligand RH liberated into the gas phase represents two equivalents for each metal complex grafted onto the silica surface, Eq. (1):2( SiOH) + MR4 ( SiO)2MR2 + 2RH (1) This 2:1 grafting stoichiometry was previously re- ported by several groups for the reactions of MR4 Fig. 1. IR spectra of silicas modified by Cr(CH2CMe3)4. Frame (A) shows the spectra of (a) Aerosil-200 and (b) Sylopol-952,both partially dehydroxylated at 200 C. Frame (B) shows the spectra of the same samples after reaction with an excess of the organochromium reagent and desorption of unreacted material. (M = Ti, Zr, Hf; R = allyl, neosilyl, neopentyl,norbornyl, benzyl) on pyrogenic silicas pretreated at 200 C [1619], and contrasts with the 1:1 stoichiom- etry reported for reactions on such silicas treated at 400 C or above [17,2024]. On this basis, Ballard speculated that the majority of hydroxyl groups on the 200 C silica surface do not occur randomly, but rather are distributed in pairs [17]. He also observed that the paired structure is lost once the silica is heated to 450 C, upon which the grafting stoichiometry changes to give supported complexes with the formula
SiOMR3. Others have argued that the observation of an overall 2:1 stoichiometry implies only an average

Values in parentheses are the number of independent experiments on which each measurement was made. Only experiments in which complete reaction of the surface hydroxyls was achieved are averaged, although it was established that neither the grafting nor the thermolysis stoichiometric ratios (RH/M) change at lower metal loadings. c RH represents the only hydrocarbon product detected, either CMe4 or SiMe4. d Values are normalized per gram of silica. composition ( SiO)2MR2, with important contribu- tions from SiOMR3 and ( SiO)3MR [23,25].
We observed the grafting stoichiometry shown in Eq. (1) regardless of metal loading on Aerosil-200 silica, up to a maximum of ca. 2 wt.% M. The sur- face reaction is self-limiting, i.e. metal loadings above 2 wt.% (ca. 0.4 mmol g1) were not achieved, and ex- periments in which more MR4 was added resulted in later desorption of unreacted MR4 from the silica sur- face to a liquid N2 cold trap. These results imply that grafting occurs exclusively on surface hydroxyl sites,since the number of accessible hydroxyl sites on this silica (0.86 mmol g1) is close to 2 M.
Silica-supported complexes derived from VR4 and CrR4 are paramagnetic and give no observable 13C CP/MAS spectra. However, it was possible to de- rive magnetic moments for the surface organometa- llic fragments from variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements on the metal-modified silicas. Both ( SiO)2V(CH2SiMe3)2 and ( SiO)2Cr (CH2CMe3)2 showed CurieWeiss behavior down to 4 K. The values derived for eff are 1.57 and
2.68 B.M., respectively, consistent with magnetically
isolated d1 and d2 sites. The 13C CP/MAS spectrum for diamagnetic ( SiO)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2 shows the methylene, quaternary and methyl carbons at 112, 35 and 32 ppm (Fig. 2). The spectrum is similar to those reported for SiOM(CH2CMe3)3 (M = Ti [24], Zr [20], Hf [21]), although in those cases the methylene carbon was not detected. The 29Si CP/MAS spectrum of ( SiO)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2 shows no peak due to
SiNp, confirming the absence of neopentyl transfer to silicon atoms of the surface during grafting.
2.2. Formation of silica-supported alkylidene
complexes Each of the silica-supported bis(alkyl) metal com- plexes is stable at room temperature provided it is scrupulously protected from air. However, each un- dergoes a thermal transformation in vacuo resulting in the evolution of a further equivalent of RH (Table 1).
These reactions occur with a precise stoichiometry,regardless of the loading of the metal complex on sil- ica, and argue strongly for compositional uniformity of the supported organometallic fragments. Since,at full loading, virtually no accessible hydroxyls re- main, and since the presence of strong metaloxygen bonds to the surface effectively prohibits mobility of Fig. 2. 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum of ( SiO)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2 (1.2 wt.% Ti). 162

the supported organometallic fragments, the thermal transformation is inferred to be intramolecular. Fur- thermore, we assert that it consists of -H abstraction to generate essentially quantitatively the correspond- ing silica-supported alkylidene complexes (Eq. (2)):( SiO)2M(CH2EMe3)2 ( SiO)2M=CHEMe3 + EMe4 (E = C, Si) (2) Such reactions are analogous to the formation of transient neopentylidene complexes deduced from isotope labeling studies [26] and predicted by calcu- lation [27] for thermolysis of Ti(CH2CMe3)4. Other mechanisms of decomposition of the molecular com- plex, such as -H abstraction and Ti-C homolysis, are calculated to have higher barriers [28] and have been ruled out experimentally [26]. In contrast, thermolysis of Cr(CH2CMe3)4 has been suggested to proceed via -H abstraction to give a transient chromacyclobutane intermediate [29]. Additional evidence implicating re- action at the -H was therefore sought for M = Cr. An isotope-labeling experiment in which the -H atoms of ( SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2 were replaced by D, via grafting of Cr(CD2CMe3)4, and subsequent ther- molysis, produced neopentane identified by GC/MS as predominantly C(CH3)3(CD3) (Eq. (3)) [30].Protonolysis of the presumed ( SiO)2Cr=CDCMe3 product with water vapor yielded the expected C(CH3)3(CDH2) (Eq. (4)):( SiO)2Cr(CD2CMe3)2 ( SiO)2Cr=CDCMe3 + C(CH3)3(CD3) (3) ( SiO)2Cr=CDCMe3 + xsH2O
C(CH3)3(CDH2)
(4) Similarly, reaction of ( SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2 with DCl gave mostly C(CH3)3(CH2D), while treatment of ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 gave mostly C(CH3)3(CD2H) (Eq. (5)):( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsDCl
C(CH3)3(CHD2)
(5) As well, electrophilic cleavage of the neopentylidene ligand with Br2 yielded C(CH3)3(CBr2H) (Eq. (6)):( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsBr2 C(CH3)3(CHBr2) (6) Fig.

Kinetics of evolution of CMe4 from ( SiO)2 Ti(CH2CMe3)2 at 70 C, monitored by integrating the absorbance of the Î½(CH) region in the gas phase IR spectrum above the modified silica. The line is the fit to the linearized first-order in- tegrated rate equation.The -H abstraction reactions of ( SiO)2M(CH2 EMe3)2 occur at characteristic temperatures, de- pending on the identities of M and E. Each of the reactions exhibits first-order kinetic behavior, shown for M = Ti in Fig. 3, as expected for an intramolec- ular transformation. Rate constants were measured by following the evolution of hydrocarbon RH in the gas phase by in situ IR spectroscopy. The values obtained for -H abstraction/elimination at ca. 70 C are k = 1.93 Ã 104, 1.10 Ã 104, 0.90 Ã 104 and ca. 0.2 Ã 104 s1 for ( SiO)2V(CH2SiMe3)2,( SiO)2Ti(CH2CMe3)2,( SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2 and ( SiO)2Cr(CH2SiMe3)2, respectively. The rate constant for thermolysis of ( SiO)2Cr(CD2CMe3)2 at this temperature is 0.28 Ã 104 s1, yielding a kinetic isotope effect kH/kD = 3.2. This effect is temperature-dependent [31], implying a multi-step mechanism for the transformation where M = Cr.
Similar reactions were not observed for the com- plexes
SiOM(CH2EMe3)3,which show much greater thermal stability than their bis(alkyl) ana- logues. We speculate that greater metal electrophilic- ity in the bis(siloxide)-substituted complexes may facilitate -H abstraction, however, steric effects
M.C. Beaudoin et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 190 (2002) 159169
163 cannot be ruled out. Also, coordination of an adjacent siloxane ligand Si2O to ( SiO)2M(CH2EMe3)2 may enhance the rate of formation of the alkylidene complex.
IR spectra of the silica-supported metal alkylidenes are not diagnostic since no especially low frequency vibration was detected for the CH stretching mode [32] (suggesting that the supported complexes are not so electron-deficient as their empirical formula ( SiO)2M=CHEMe3 implies, vide infra). However,in each case, the integrated absorbance of the CH vibrations decreased by 50%, consistent with the loss of one alkyl ligand. No Î½(M=C) vibration was identified due to the high absorbance of the silica support below 1300 cm1. The magnetic moments of ( SiO)2V=CHSiMe3 and ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 were measured to be 1.63 and 2.77 B.M., respec- tively, confirming that the oxidation states and mononuclearity of the supported metal alkylidenes remain unchanged from that of their precursors ( SiO)2M(CH2EMe3)2.
The natural abundance 13C CP/MAS NMR spec- trum of ( SiO)2Ti=CHCMe3 does not display any new low field signal attributable to the alkylidene carbon. This finding is similar to a previous report for a silica-supported Ta neopentylidene complex [33], and is presumably due to its low abundance,low cross-polarization efficiency and rigidity of the alkylidene carbon.
2.3. Reactions of silica-supported alkylidene
complexes Isolable high-valent alkylidene complexes of the early first-row transition metals are relatively rare [1,3438]. Their reactivity has thus been much less investigated compared to heavier congeners. How- ever, there are many characteristic reactions of metal alkylidenes of the second and third-row metals,which are considered diagnostic of M=C functional- ity [32]. The degree of resemblance between these molecular complexes and silica-supported alkyli- dene complexes was therefore explored through reactivity.
Reactions of silica-supported alkylidene complexes with electrophiles such as H+ and Br2 are described earlier. The pseudo-Wittig reaction of ( SiO)2 Cr=CHCMe3 with acetone yields 2,5,5-trimethyl- pent-1-ene [39] (Eq. (7)):( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsMe2C=O Me2C=CHCMe3 (7) Olefin metathesis products neohexene and trimethyl- vinylsilane were detected upon reaction of ( SiO)2 M=CHEMe3 (M = V, Cr) with styrene (Eq. (8)):( SiO)2M=CHEMe3 + xsPhCH=CH2 H2C=CHEMe3 (E = C, Si) (8) The initial surface organometallic product is presum- ably the benzylidene complex ( SiO)2M=CHPh,which was not isolated since it appears to undergo subsequent reaction with styrene.In contrast, reaction of ( SiO)2M=CHEMe3 with excess ethylene yielded no olefin metathesis prod- ucts, consistent with the observations made for reac- tions of Ta(V) and Cr(VI) neopentylidene complexes [35,40]. Ethylene uptake was instead characterized by oligomerization/polymerization. The nature of the reaction was strongly metal-dependent: for M = Cr,polymerization was rapid and extensive, whereas ethylene uptake self-terminated after addition of ca. 40 eq. C2H4 for M = V and Ti (Fig. 4). Traces of lin- ear -olefins (1-hexene, 1-octene, etc.) were also de- tected. When ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 was dosed with a very small amount (ca. 1 equivalent) of ethylene,the volatiles detected were primarily the C7 olefins 4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, 4,4-dimethylpent-1-ene and 2,3,3-trimethylbutene. The origin of these products is likely the coupling of a neopentylidene ligand with ethylene. In support of this hypothesis, reaction of ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 with a small amount of C2D4 generated (CD3)CD=CHC(CH3)3, identified by its MS fragmentation pattern.
Surface organometallic complexes with the general formula ( SiO)2MR2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) have been re- ported to react with H2 to give supported metal hydride complexes which hydrogenate [19,41] and polymerize [16,42,43] olefins. The formation of spectroscopically detectable hydrido complexes generally results in a dramatic increase in polymerization activity [44,45],however, hydrogenation of the silica-supported com- plexes requires elevated temperatures (100200 C) and results, in particular for M = Ti, in a number of different supported hydride complexes as well as par- tial reduction of the metal. Therefore, the possibility 164

The background spectrum of silica was removed by subtraction. of forming hydrido complexes of the silica-supported first-row metals under milder conditions, i.e. directly from the supported alkylidenes, was explored.Exposure of ( SiO)2Cr=CHEMe3 to 100 Torr H2 at room temperature resulted in no discernable reac- tion, as judged by a lack of change in the IR spec- trum, even after several days. Upon heating, the onset of hydrogenation was noted at ca. 150 C, accompa- nied by formation of volatile hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane and propane in addition to neopen- tane (E = C) and SiMe4 (E = Si). The intermediacy of surface CrH species is inferred, however, the quan- tities formed were too small to permit spectroscopic detection.
An alternate low temperature route to metal hy- drides from alkylidenes is the addition of a silane across M=C, reported recently for M = Ta [46,47]. Al- though ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 gave no reaction when treated with Me3SiH, even after several days at room temperature, a reaction occurred readily with 70 Torr Et2SiH2 vapor. In the IR spectrum, the integrated in- tensity of the vibrations in the Î½(CH) region increased to approximately double its initial value, while two new hydride vibrations were detected at 2137 and 2078 cm1 (Fig. 5). The frequency of the higher en- ergy mode closely resembles the spectrum of Et2SiH2,which consists of two closely-spaced bands at 2140 and 2133 cm1. The lower energy mode is inferred to belong to Î½(CrH). The reaction with Et2SiH2 is for- mulated as addition of the silane across the Cr=C bond (Eq. (9)):( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 + xsEt2SiH2 ( SiO)2(H)CrC(H)(SiHEt2)(CMe3) (9) The presence of a surface Cr hydride was further confirmed by exposure of the sample to CH3I, upon which methane was detected in the gas phase above

Fur- thermore, exposure of the Et2SiH2-treated sample to D2 resulted in a very slow loss of Î½(CrH) intensity and the appearance of a weak band at 1557 cm1,consistent with the conversion of CrH to CrD. The hydride complex is also an active catalyst for ethylene polymerization; details will be reported later.
The silica-supported alkylidene complexes de- scribed here are not electrophilic enough to activate the CH bonds of arenes, as has been reported for transient [(2,6-iPr2C6H3)N)2Cr=CHCMe3] [35] or alkanes, similar to Cp*W(NO)(CHCMe3) [48]. Al- though the formula ( SiO)2M=CHEMe3 as written suggests a high degree of coordinative unsaturation,this is almost certainly mitigated by the abundance of surface oxygens within coordination distance of M (vide infra).
2.4. Effect of silica support
The Aerosil silica used in all of the experiments described above is a highly pure, non-porous com- bustion aerosol with irregularly shaped primary par- ticles of average diameter 12 nm. It is further known from small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering mea- surements that the surfaces of such fumed silica parti- cles are smooth (surface fractal dimension Ds = 2.0) down to the molecular length-scale [49]. The extent of hydroxylation of the surface exerts a strong effect on subsequent reaction chemistry with MR4, yielding ei- ther ( SiO)2MR2 or SiOMR3, as described earlier.
Despite the empirical evidence for formulation of the alkylidene complexes as ( SiO)2M=CHEMe3,the coordination number of the metal in these or the bis(alkyl) complexes which precede them has not yet been established. Indeed, we believe it is highly un- likely that three-coordinate complexes persist in the presence of many possible oxygen donor atoms dis- posed in proximity around the silica-supported alkyli- dene complexes. Association with the oxygen of a nearby siloxane bridge to form a pseudo-tetrahedral surface complex is a likely possibility (Eq. (10)):( SiO)2M=CHEMe3 + SiOSi
( SiO)2( Si2O)M=CHEMe3 (10) Since the strength of the metalsiloxane interaction may influence reactivity of the silica-supported alkyli- denes, and the nature of the silica is known to be particularly important in determining the activity of supported polymerization catalysts [42,50], evidence for siloxane participation in the coordination sphere was sought by varying the nature of the silica.
Grafting of Cr(CH2EMe3)4 on a porous silica gel, Sylopol-952, was accomplished in the same fashion as the reaction on Aerosil. After thermal treatment in vacuo at 200 C, the accessible hydroxyl content of this silica, 1.25 mmol g1, is significantly higher than that of Aerosil-200. Regardless of loading, the reac- tion of Cr(CH2EMe3)4 with the surface OH groups of Sylopol-952 occurs with the same stoichiometry as on Aerosil-200. For E = C, the reaction results in the liberation of (2.0  0.3) CMe4 per grafted Cr (average of four experiments). Thus, the sur- face complexes on Sylopol silica are formulated as ( SiO)2Cr(CH2EMe3)2. The IR spectra of the sup- ported organochromium fragments is very similar on porous and non-porous silicas (Fig. 1) with the ex- ception that a much larger fraction of the hydroxyls which appear in the IR spectrum of the Cr-modified Sylopol silica are inaccessible to organochromium reagents. 166
M.C. Beaudoin et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 190 (2002) 159169
Thermolysis of ( SiO)2Cr(CH2CMe3)2 supported on Sylopol-952 at 70 C resulted in the evolution of
1.1  0.2 eq. CMe4 as the exclusive volatile prod-
uct. The rate constant, k = 0.98 Ã 104 s1, is sim- ilar to that measured for the material prepared with Aerosil-200 (k = 0.90Ã104 s1). Therefore, we sug- gest that a neopentylidene complex of Cr(IV) is again formed, and that the nature of the silica support does not appear to substantially influence either grafting or -H abstraction. Nevertheless, evidence for an effect of the silica ligand on the subsequent reactivity of supported alkylidene complexes was found in their re- actions with ethylene (vide infra).
2.5. Initiation of ethylene polymerization
The rate law for polymerization of low pressures (40400 Torr) of C2H4 over ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 on Aerosil-200 has been investigated and the kinetics reported in some detail [51]. The gassolid reaction displays no observable induction period at room tem- perature, no deactivation occurs during the course of polymerization and there is no evidence for mass transport effects. Mechanistic investigation of the reaction, including measurement of the activation pa- rameters and the absence of a primary kinetic isotope effect, rules out alkylidene complexes as propagating intermediates (which appeared in earlier proposals for polymerization mechanisms over Phillips catalysts [10,11]), and agrees with the findings of computational investigations [52,53]. Furthermore, the formation of neopentylidene-containing olefins during polymeriza- tion suggests that the alkylidene ligand is eliminated from the supported catalyst upon exposure to ethy- lene during a fast initiation reaction. High-valent Cr alkylidenes have been predicted to undergo reductive elimination upon reaction with olefins, in contrast to Mo and W analogues which favor metathesis [54].
Although the mechanism of polymerization has been studied extensively for cationic, d0 complexes of group IV, many other electron configurations are known to be consistent with appreciable activity. The d2 configuration (i.e. Cr(IV)) in our homologous se- ries of silica-supported complexes is by far the most active. The involvement of a cationic silica-supported Cr(IV) complex was suggested in a computational study [52], but its formation is considered unlikely,since protonation of the alkylidene ligand by a surface silanol would also undoubtedly be accompanied by the formation of a covalent metalsiloxide interaction [53].
The precise nature of the initiation is still unclear.
However, it seems reasonable to postulate an inter- action between ethylene and ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 to generate the chromacyclobutane analogous to that required by its metathetical reaction with styrene (Eq. (8)). Calculations on a model Cr ethylidene system predict a highly exothermic (2 + 2) addition of ethylene with almost no barrier [52]. Although neohexene, the olefin metathesis product, was not detected, formation of 2,3,3-trimethylbutene suggests that de-insertion of neohexene can occur, followed by rotation of the coordinated olefin. However, it must rapidly re-add to ( SiO)2Cr=CH2 to generate the chromacyclobutane with the tert-butyl substituent in the -position (Scheme 1). This mechanism of isomerization, albeit for the transformation of the -substituted metallacyclobutane to the -substituted isomer, has been demonstrated for a titanocene com- plex [55].
Extrusion of 4,4-dimethylpentenes from an -t-butyltitanacyclobutane has been observed [38,40],with a suggested mechanism of -H elimination to the allyl hydride complex, followed by reductive elimination [32,38]. On our catalyst, the immediate organometallic product may be the reduced ethylene complex, or the chromacyclopentane, via the cycliza- tion of two coordinated C2H4 at the reduced Cr site.
Both find precedent in experimental studies of tantala- cyclobutane decomposition in the presence of olefins [38,40], observations of ethene trimerization by ho- mogeneous Cr [56,57] and Ta [58] catalysts, and the- oretical calculations on Cr(IV) model complexes [53].
Spontaneous extrusion of C7 olefins is thus inferred to precede the formation of polyethylene on the ac- tive sites. This observation allows us to estimate the number of such sites in two ways. First, the Î½(CH) intensity in the in situ IR spectrum decreases to ap- proximately two-thirds of its initial value upon expo- sure of ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 to C2D4, implying that one-third of the neopentylidene ligands were elimi- nated. Second, treatment of the polymer-enshrouded catalyst with HCl after polymerization resulted in the liberation of 0.67 eq. of neopentane per Cr, suggest- ing that two-thirds of the neopentylidene sites did not react with ethylene. In agreement with these findings,

167 Scheme 1. selective poisoning of the active sites with substoichio- metric amounts of O2 resulted in complete inhibition of polymerization activity for ca. 60 Torr C2H4 when the amount of O2 added corresponded to 20% of total Cr [59].
The inability of a substantial fraction of neopentyli- dene sites to add ethylene, despite the presumed facil- ity of this reaction, suggests that initiation is inhibited by another, stronger interaction, such as the coordi- nation of an adjacent siloxane oxygen as in Eq. (10).
Since the strength of the interaction is presumably dependent on geometric considerations, which might be expected to vary for different sites on the silica surface, it is reasonable to assume that ethylene can displace the siloxane ligand in some but not all of the supported complexes (Eq. (11)):( SiO)2( Si2O)Cr=CHCMe3 + C2H4 ( SiO)2(C2H4)Cr=CHCMe3 + SiOSi
(11) According to this explanation, higher pressures of C2H4 should be able to activate more neopentyli- dene sites, due to displacement of the equilibrium shown in Eq. (11) to the right. In agreement with this hypothesis, the threshold for inhibition of poly- merization activity by O2 increased from 20 to 30% poisoning of the Cr sites when the C2H4 pressure was raised from 60 to 250 Torr. The dis- tribution of binding constants for C2H4 may also contribute to the broad polydispersities (typically 15 < Mw/Mn < 20) of the polyethylene produced over both single-site ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 [59] and heterogeneous Cr/SiO2 catalysts in general.The reaction of ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3, supported on Sylopol-952, with 40 Torr C2H4 is not spontaneous at room temperature. This finding was surprising in view of the very similar stoichiometry of the grafting reaction and IR spectrum compared to the Aerosil-200 reaction. Upon further investigation, we discovered that polymerization does occur in the presence of 1 atm
C2H4. We propose that spectroscopically undetected
(thus far) siloxane coordination results in a stronger interaction with the potential active sites on the surface of Sylopol-952 than on Aerosil-200 surface, thereby inhibiting polymerization at lower pressures. This phe- nomenon is suggested to be a consequence of the sur- face roughness of the silica gel (with a surface fractal dimension close to 3.0 [60]), resulting in greater prox- imity of adjacent siloxanes to the grafted Cr sites. 168

3. Experimental
AerosilTM-200 (BET surface area 183 m2 g1) is an amorphous, non-porous fumed silica manufac- tured by Degussa Corp. Sylopol-952 (BET surface area 309 m2 g1) is a precipitated silica gel from GraceDavison. The content of accessible hydroxyls on each silica, after partial dehydroxylation, was mea- sured by VOCl3 chemisorption [61]. Ti(CH2CMe3)4, V(CH2SiMe3)4, Cr(CH2CMe3)4 and Cr(CH2SiMe3)4 were prepared by literature procedures and purified by sublimation [6265]. Vacuum techniques for the preparation and characterization of bis(alkyl) and alkylidene complexes grafted onto silica surfaces,including selective deuterium isotope labeling, have previously been described in detail [22,31]. Since the supported organometallic complexes are highly air-sensitive, all manipulations were performed fol- lowing strict high vacuum protocols, using breakseal techniques.
High purity C2H4 (Matheson), H2 (Air Products) and C2D4 (98% D, Cambridge Isotopes) were further purified by passing each one through a trap containing a mixture of BTS Deoxo Catalyst (Caledon Labora- tories Ltd.) and 3 Ã molecular sieves (Aldrich), then stored in glass high vacuum bulbs. The desired gas was transferred into the in situ reactor containing the catalyst through a high vacuum line (base pressure <104 Torr) equipped with a capacitance manometer reading absolute pressures. Liquid reagents were pur- chased from Aldrich, dried over molecular sieves and stored under vacuum in glass vessels equipped with high vacuum Teflon stopcocks. Vapor phase trans- fer into the reactors was achieved via the vacuum manifold.All IR experiments were performed in situ, in reactors with IR-transparent KCl windows. In exper- iments with a single gaseous product, quantitation of the volatile organic component was also achieved by IR, using the gas phase spectra of known pres- sures of pure compounds to construct calibration curves. For NMR experiments, the Ti-modified silica was prepared in powdered form in a Schlenk tube equipped with a high vacuum stopcock and 5 mm o.d.Pyrex NMR tubes welded onto the main body of the Schlenk tube at right angles. Samples were transferred in vacuo into the NMR tubes and sealed at 30 mm lengths with a torch, to give tubes containing approxi- mately 50 mg of sample. The 13C and 29Si CP/MAS (cross polarization/magic angle spinning) NMR spec- tra were recorded on a Bruker ASX-200 spectrometer at frequencies of 50.32 and 39.75 MHz, respectively. 13C spectra were collected at a spin rate of 4 kHz using a 4.4 ms 90proton pulse with a contact time of 2 ms and relaxation delay of 2 s and treated with 20 Hz line broadening. For 29Si spectra, the contact time was 10 ms and the relaxation delay 1 s.Mixtures of volatile organic products were analyzed by GC and/or GC/MS. Metal analyses were performed by colorimetry after quantitative extraction from the modified silicas, following previously described procedures [66].
