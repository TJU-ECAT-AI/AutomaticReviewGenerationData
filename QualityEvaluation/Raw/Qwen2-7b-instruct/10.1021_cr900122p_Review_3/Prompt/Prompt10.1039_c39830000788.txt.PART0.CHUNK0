I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

7 790 Gif-sur- Yvette, France Selective catalytic dehydrogenation (up to 9 turnovers) of cycloalkanes CnHZn (n = 6, 7, and 8) to the corresponding cycloalkenes is achieved, under mild conditions (30-80 "C), using dilute (ca. 3 mM) solutions of the bis(ph0sphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 (Ar = p-F-C6H4, Ph, and p-Me-C,H,) in the cycloalkane, with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor.
A few soluble transition metal systems have recently been dis- covered which, when activated either thermally12 (e.g., by reaction with an olefin which removes two or more hydride ligands) or photochemically3 (e.g., by dissociation of H, or CO), afford highly reactive, co-ordinatively unsaturated,intermediates capable of inserting into alkane C-H bonds.
Thus, the key step in the conversion of cycloalkanes C,H,,(n = 6, 7, and 8) into the corresponding cycloalkenes using the bis(ph0sphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar,P),ReH, (la-c),in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbut-l-ene (2) as a hydrogen acceptor, is thought to involve the insertion of a 14e inter- mediate such as (Ar3P),ReH3 into a C-H bond of the cyclo- a 1
kane. t Consideration of the various possible reactions occurring in this system suggested to us that the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes might be made catalytic [with respect to (l)] simply by using low concentrations of the reagents (1) and (2).
We now report that this is indeed the case.
7 We have recently re-examined these reactions and found that,in some cases, the yields of cycloalkenes are higher than those we reported previously [30--80% based on ( 1)12 especially in reactions involving the heptahydride (la), which now appears to be a more efficient reagent than both (lb) and (lc).The reasons for this dis- parity, which may be due to use of purer starting materials [hydrocarbon or (l)] or to subtle differences in experimental pro- cedure, will be discussed in our full paper. (Ar,P),ReH 7 Buf-CH=CH2 b, Ar = Ph c, Ar = p-Me-C,H,(1); a, Ar = p-F-C6H4 (2) Our best results have been obtained with the heptahydride (la) and cyclo-octane. This system is far more reactive than we previously suspected. Thus, when a pale buff, deoxygen- ated, solution of (la) (3.3 mM) and the olefin (2) (50 mM) in cyclo-octane was made up at ca. 20 "C and then placed in a bath preheated to 30 "C, within 5 min the colour had changed to pale amber and cyclo-octene (0.7 mM, 0.2 turnover) had already been formed. After 10 min, the concentration of cyclo- octene had reached its maximum (5.3 mM, 1.6 turnovers).
This system therefore functions catalytically even at 30 "C.The number of turnovers was greater [9 mol of cyclo-octenez per mol of (la) after 10 min] when the bath was preheated to 80 "C. Under similar conditions (bath preheated to 80 "C),cyclohexane gave cyclohexenef (3.2 turnovers) and cyclo- heptane gave cycloheptene (4 turnovers). The heptahydrides (lb)4 and (1c)j were rather less effective [e.g.,cyclo-octene, 6 turnovers using (lb), cyclohexene, 1.4 turnovers using (lc)]. $ In these experiments, the cycloalkene was identified by g.c.-m.s.
In the others, identification of the products was by g.c. retention times. The yields were determined by g.c.

All these reactions were totally selective; no other dehydro- genation products (e.g., benzene from cyclohexane) could be detected.
The relatively large free energy of hydrogenation of the olefin (2) (21.9 kcal/mo16) (1 kcal = 4.1 8 kJ) is not a determin- ing factor in these reactions, since the dehydrogenation of cyclo-octane [using (la)] was still catalytic (5 turnovers instead of 9) with cyclohexene (free energy of hydrogenation
18.7 kcal/moP) as the hydrogen acceptor instead of (2).
Methylcyclohexane gave a mixture of olefins. The results (Table I )  are interesting for several reasons: (a) they show that the various olefins, once formed, are not all interconverted by these rhenium hydride systems, since 1 -methylcyclohexene (the most stable of the four isomers7) is present in no more than trace amounts; (b) they show that radical intermediates cannot be involved, since the major products (3- and 4- methylcyclohexene) cannot have arisen from the tertiary I-methylcyclohexyl radical which would have been formed preferentially in a radical process;8 (c) they show that adventi- tious traces of a rhenium colloid cannot be responsible for these dehydrogenations, since a common intermediate such as this would have led to the formation of the same mixture of olefins from all three heptahydrides; and (d) they suggest that the intrinsic reactivity sequence is Me > CH, > CH, and that this is counteracted by a strong steric effect which directs the reagents, especially those containing bulky phosphines (Ar,P), away from the more hindered sites (i.e., Me, 2-CH,,and 6-CH2 in methylcyclohexane).
Even though the total number of turnovers achieved by this system under present conditions is limited, the results reported here establish for the first time that the selective, non-radical,catalytic functionalisation of an unstrained hydrocarbon by means of a soluble transition-metal catalyst is a feasible process.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
