99 1 Activation and Functionalisation of the C-H Bonds of Methane and Higher Alkanes by a Silica-supported Tantalum Hydride Complex Veronique Vidal, Albert Theolier, Jean Thivolle-Cazat and Jean-Marie Basset" Laboratoire de Chimie Organometallique de Surface, UMR CNRS-CPE 9986, 2, Avenue A. Einstein,69626 Villeurbanne Cedex, France Silica-supported tantalum hydride activates at low temperature the C-H and the C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4,respectively, to form the corresponding cyclooctyl and perdeuteriomethyl-tantalum surface complexes; these complexes are transformed under molecular oxygen into the corresponding tantalum-alkoxy derivatives which with acetic acid give rise to the corresponding alkylacetates.
The valorisation of methane and higher alkanes still constitutes a major scientific challenge. In the field of classical organome- tallic chemistry, numerous complexes of transition metals of Groups 3-5, lanthanides and actinides have been reported to activate the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes and aromatics. These highly electrophilic complexes with a do configuration are commonly believed to activate the C-H bond of alkanes by a cr-bond metathesis mehanism.l.J Recently,we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 O
C
,respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium- alkyls.4.5 The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane,isobutane or neopentane.5.6.7 The unexpected high activity of these surface organometallic fragments in catalytic conditions which usually require much higher temperatures in classical heterogeneous catalysis, has been ascribed to the high electro- philic character of these metals which are formally eight electron species, associated with the immobilisation and isolation of the zirconium centres which prevent dimerisation or more generally deactivation.
We have therefore tried to see if other silica-supported early transition metal hydrides could lead to similar types of C-H bond activation, one of the objectives being a possible functionalisation after activation. We report here that a silica- supported tantalum-hydride is also able to activate cyclooctane and methane to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species. We also demonstrate that these surface tantalum-alkyls can be transformed under molecular oxygen into the corre- sponding tantalum-alkoxy derivatives which with acetic acid gives the corresponding alkylacetates.
We have recently reported that the reaction of the trisneo- pentyl(neopenty1idene)tantalum complex Ta(-CH2- CMe3)3(=CH-CMe3)* 1 with the silanol groups of a silica previously dehydroxylated at 500 "C (silica5m), leads to the formation of two surface species:=SiO-Ta(-CH2-
CTV%)(=CH-CM)
2a (ca. 65%) and (zSi0)2Ta(-CH2- CMe3)(=CH-CMe3) 2b (ca. 35%), with liberation of neopent- ane.? These two grafted complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, chemical reactivity with D20 and acetone (pseudo-Wittig reaction) and by FT-IR and 13C
CP-MAS NMR
spectroscopies.9 When 2a and 2b are treated under hydrogen (1 atm; 150 "C for 15 h), supported tantalum-hydride [Ta],-H 3 is formed,characterized by an IR band at v 1830 and shoulders at 18 15 and 1855 cm- 1 [Fig. 1 (a)]. Simultaneously, neopentane is evolved in the gas phase as well as methane, ethane, propane and isobutane resulting either from a partial hydrogenolysis of the neopentyl or neopentylidene ligands or more likely from the hydrogenolysis of the neopentane released during the hydro- genolysis of these hydrocarbyl ligands.
Complex 3 exchanges reversibly with deuterium at room temperature as evidenced by the reversible shift under D2 and then H2 of the three IR bands at 1815, 1830 and 1855 cm-1.
Complex 3 reacts with water to liberate hydrogen and with Me1 to form CH4. Although full characterization of 3 is still in progress, it seems that an eight electron TaIII monohydride (=Si0)2Ta(H) linked to the silica surface by two siloxy fragments is the major (if not unique) component.$ Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4 [eqn. (l)]. Evidence for reaction (1) is as [TaIs-H + cyclo-C8H16 + [Ta]s-cyclo-CHI5

follows: (a) after gas phase evacuation, IR bands at 2929,2857 [v(CH2)] and 1477,1468,1448 cm-l[6(CH2)] characteristic of methylene groups appear on the silica disc [Fig. l(b)]; these bands are resistant to prolonged evacuation at room temp. under which conditions physisorbed cyclooctane is removed (inde- pendent experiment). Simultaneously, the intensity of the I
R
bands at 1815, 1830 and 1855 cm-1 decreases; (6) the reaction produces molecular hydrogen as evidenced by GC; (c) introduc- tion of water vapour on the surface complex 4, resulting from the reaction of 3 with cyclooctane,liberates cyclooctane and the IR bands corresponding to v(CH2), and 6(CH2) vibration modes disappear [Fig. l(c)]; ( d )
after introduction of dry oxygen (200 tom; 25 "C) on the presumed tantalum-cyclooctyl species 4, a new surface complex is formed which is resistant to hydrolysis;further introduction of a vapour of acetic acid (1 5 ton) liberates cyclooctyl-acetate as a major product; this demonstrates that oxygen has been inserted into the Ta-C bond, probably via a peroxo intermediate as known in molecular chemistry,lo to form

AcOH 11 [Ta]s-CD3 -+ [TaIs-O-CD3 - [Tals-OH + AcO-CD3 (4) To our knowledge, this is the first example of an intermol- ecular alkane activation on a supported tantalum hydride.Photolytic or thermal reaction of benzene with (q5-C5H5)Ta- (Me)(PMe3) has already been reported;l2 an oxidative addition of benzene was assumed but the presence of (But)2SiH2 proved to be necessary; the role of the silane was to favour the liberation of methane before the activation of benzene;( B u  )  S  H also induced the exchange of the phenyl group with C6D6 on the obtained complex. Thermal or photochemical reaction of (q5-C5H&Ta(H)3 with hydrosilanes R3SiH has also been reported.13J4 In the case of PhMe2SiH only the sym- metrical adduct (q5-C5H5)Ta(H)SiMe2Ph(H) supported by an X-ray structure determination was obtained;l3 the other isomers

with the silyl group in the lateral position were also observed as minor components in the case of SiH4, MeSiH3, Me2SiH2, Me3SiH, Me2SiHC1 or (Me0)3SiH.I4 In both case, hydrogen was assumed to be released before the oxidative addition of the silane.
This kind of mechanism differs from that which is usually mentioned in the case of early transition metals, lanthanides or actinides, for which a a-bond metathesis process is invoked.le.233 In the present case of supported tantalum- hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation [eqn. (5)].However, we cannot yet

shown that the electron attractive substituent SiMe3 on the cyclopentadienyl ligands makes the hydrogen more labile in the [(q5-C5H3)SiMe&NbH3 complex than in (q5-C5H5)2Nb(H)3. l5 In the same way, the presence of siloxy ligands coordinated to tantalum instead of the cyclopentadienyl ligands should make the metal far more electrophilic and may favour the departure of hydrogen.Moreover, the present supported tantalum-hydride [Tals-H 3 proves to be far more active towards C-H bond activation than the corresponding molecular complexes; indeed, complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with cyclooctane whereas irradiation or heating to 100 "C are required to form the corresponding molecular Ta-alkyl or -silyl complexes. This is probably due to the direct grafting of tantalum on silica which results (a) in the formation of Si-O-Ta bonds which will make the tantalum very electrophilic, (b) in the isolation of the metallic centres and (c) in the stabilisation of highly co- ordinatively unsaturated species, all parameters which are difficult to govern in solution.
The subsequent oxidation step illustrates the possibility of selectively introducing an oxygen atom into the alkane molecule.

The solid samples thus obtained were ca. 5 mass% Ta. All further reactants were carefully dried over freshly regenerated molecular sieves and when necessary deoxygen- ated over deoxo traps. The IR spectra were recorded from a glass cell with CaF2 windows, on a FT-IR Nicolet 550 spectrometer. Gas phases were analysed by GC. $ The full characterization of complex 3 will be published elsewhere.
