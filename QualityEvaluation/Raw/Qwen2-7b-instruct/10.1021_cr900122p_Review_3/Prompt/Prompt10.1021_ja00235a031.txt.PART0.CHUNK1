(42) When 2 is treated with only 1 or 2 equiv of propene, or if the reaction is carried out at 80 O
C
even with excess propene, the reaction is not as straightforward as indicated by eq 29. In addition to the products listed in eq 29, isobutene and Cp*,ScCH2CH2CH3 (9) are also observed. A reasonable explanation is that P-H elimination from the isobutyl complex may compete with u bond metathesis. Insertion of propene into the Sc-H bond of Cp*,ScH (generated by 0-H elimination) is, in fact, rapid (eq 9).

toss of alkane f The preference for u bond metathesis over insertion for terminal acetylenes with Sc-R (R = H, alkyl) is further illustrated by the rapid reaction of CP*SCH with propyne to afford CP*SCCZ CCH3 and H2 (eq 35).

Curiously, whereas trans-Cp*,ScCH=CHMe (15) is, indeed, stable, it is not formed, even after prolonged heating of the product mixture from reaction 35.
As noted in the previous section, Cp*,ScCH, (2) reacts cleanly with benzene to yield C P *  S C C  H ,(3) (eq 24). The strongly electrophilic nature of the scandium center of 2, evidenced by its high affinity for Lewis bases, and the insertion reactions with ethylene, propene, and 2-butyne, which undoubtedly proceed by interaction of scandium with the a orbitals of these substrates,suggest that the enhanced reactivity of permethylscandocene derivatives with sp2- and sp-hybridized C-H bonds might well be attributable to initial attack of scandium at the P orbitals of these substrates. As suggested earlier6 by two of us (M.E.T. and J.E.B.),vinylic C-H bond activation could be viewed as arising from attack of scandium at the terminal carbon of substituted olefins to produce a zwitterionic intermediate or transition state, which collapses to product via abstraction of the proton a to the sub- stituted carbenium ion by the methyl "carbanion" (Scheme I).45 The activation of aryl C-H bonds would then resemble electro- philic aromatic substitution (of [Cp*,Sc+] for H'), proceeding via a similar phenonium intermediate (or transition state) (Scheme 11). The analogue in organic chemistry for the rapid reactions of the terminal C-H bonds of alkynes with Cp*,ScCH3 is not as (44) McDade, C.; Bercaw, J. E. J .  Organomet. Chem. 1985, 279, 281. (45) The insensitivity of the rate constant for reaction of the para sub- stituted styrenes is not consistent with this type of mechanism, however.

obvious; however, the higher acidity of these sp-hybridized C-H bonds would once again be generally in accord with such hete- rolytic carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage mechanisms.
Although attack of an electrophile at the highest occupied molecular orbital of an unsaturated substrate (Le., at the T or- bitals) is entirely plausible, interaction of the frontier orbitals of scandium46 with the T orbitals of alkenes or arenes does impose very unfavorable steric interactions of the arene ring or the /3 substituents of the alkene with the bulky ($-C5Mes) ligands in the intermediate (or transition state). Direct attack of scandium at the C-H u bond (perpendicular to the R system) is considerably less crowded as shown in Schemes I and 11.
In order to experimentally probe these issues, the mechanism of reaction of (Cp*-d15)2ScCH3 with (perprotio) arenes was more closely examined. As noted above, deuteriation of the penta- methylcyclopentadienyl ligands reduces the complications from competing unimolecular decomposition to [ ($-CsMe5)-

Although several of the arenes possess other C-H bonds (e.g., C6HSN(CH3),, C6HsCH3) or other potentially reactive u bonds (e.g., C6H5CF3),clean conversion to CH4 and the aryl derivative of permethylscandocene are observed in all cases.

(37) 5 the kinetic ratios for the reactions of 2 and 5 with toluene, since authentic samples of 0-4 and p-4 do not isomerize on the time scale of these experiments (80 "C, <8 h, entry 4). The kinetic and thermodynamic ratios of the tolyl isomers appear to be the same (f3%), since prolonged heating of Cp*2SC(O-C6H&H3) eventually gives an unchanging ratio of tolyl isomers (entry 7),which is the same as the kinetic ratio, within experimental error.Significantly, Cp*&CH2C& ( 5 )  is a kinetic product of the reaction of 2 with C6H,CH3 (eq 37); however, as shown by entry 3, 5 eventually reacts further to afford the thermodynamically more stable mixture of tolyl isomers. Furthermore, the kinetic ratio of meta-toly1:para-tolyl products is nearly statistical (i.e.,the rates of u bond metathesis for meta and para positions are roughly equal), whereas the ortho-tolyl product is formed more slowly and is thermodynamically less stable, presumably for steric reactions.The results of these experiments are clearly inconsistent with u bond metathesis mechanisms involving attack of scandium at the p T orbitals of olefins or arenes (Schemes I and 11). The following observations are particularly definitive in this regard:(i) hydrogen incorporation into toluene-d, and H, and Cp*,Sc-H (eq 14) proceeds at the same rate for para and meta positions (ortho being lower); (ii) there are no appreciable resonance effects on the second-order rate constants for reaction of Cp*,ScCH3 with the trans vinylic C-H bonds of p-XC6H,CH=CH2 (X = OCH3, CF3) (Table IV) indicative of a relatively nonpolar transition state for formation of the trans styrenyl complex, inconsistent with the zwitterionic one proposed in Scheme I; (iii) the rate of reaction of Cp*,ScCH, with substituted arenes is insensitive to the (7) donating or withdrawing character of the substituent (Table V),in contrast to very large rate differences commonly observed for electrophilic aromatic substitution; C6H,NMe2 and C6H,CF3 214

differ by as much as 108-1010,47 rarely less than 103-106;48 and perhaps most convincing (iv) the (ortho-) para preference char- acteristic of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of toluene is not observed for a u bond metathesis between C6HjCH3 and Cp*,ScCH, (2) (Table VI). Large rate differences among various substituted benzenes are usually characteristic of electrophilic aromatic substitution; however, the absence of such effects may not be diagnostic, particularly for extremely reactive electrophile.
A more definitive test for electrophilic attack is the positional selectivity of the substitution. For example, nitration of toluene proceeds with >95% ortho-para selectivity; the electrophile,[NO,'] attacks 6% at the two meta positions. All electrophiles,even very active ones, show a high ortho-para:meta preference.jO Moreover, electrophilic transition-metal complexes show the same strong preference; e.g., [Cp*Re(NO)(CO)]+ and [PtCIj]- attack toluene electrophilically with 2k,,,,/k,,,,= 32 and 18, respec- tively.51 Competitive attack at the benzylic C-H bonds of toluene is never observed.None of these characteristics of electrophilic aromatic sub- stitution are exhibited in the reaction of Cp*2ScCH3 with toluene.Indeed, significant amounts of the benzyl tautomer 5 are observed early in the reaction, and significantly, 2kpara/kmeta = 1.0.Rate-determining homolysis of the Sc-CH, bond to produce free [Cp*,Sc'] and [CH,'] radicals appears inconsistent with the general reactivity patterns for Cp*,ScCH3 (2) with substrates:(i) cleavage of the strongest C-H bonds of substrates (e.g., H- CH=CHCH3, H-CzCCH,,in addition to H-C6H,CH3, etc.),(ii) pyrolysis of 2 in cyclohexane-d,, affords only CH4(<3%
CH3D),
and (iii) very large negative entropies of activation for the u bond metathesis between CP*S&H, and H-CH=CHPh (ca. -35 eu), indicative of an associative rate-limiting step. An estimate of the kinetic deuterium isotope effect can be made from the rate differences for (Cp*-dl5),ScCH3 with C6H6 and C6D6 at 80 "C: 1.29 ( 5 )  X s-'.M-' and 4.7 (1) s-'.M-',respectively (kH/kD = 2.8 (2)), suggestive of moderate arene C-H bond weakening in the transition state. A mechanistic model which accommodates these experimental results is presented in the Conclusions section below.Reaction of Alkyl Derivatives of Permethylscandocene with Alkyl Halides. u bond metathesis is also observed for Cp*,Sc-CH3 (2) and I3CH3-I (eq 38), reminiscent of the reaction of 2 with 25 '

I3CH3-H (eq 26). An additional, irreversible reaction proceeds at a comparable rate: coupling of the methyl groups with for- mation of CP*SCI and ethane (eq 39). The latter reaction is undoubtedly thermodynamically preferred, in view of the strong Sc-I bond (vis-a-vis CH,I bond) generated. Alkyl exchange also precedes coupling in the reaction of Cp*,ScCH2CH3 (8) with methyl iodide (eq 40).

The general reaction (eq 42) illustrates the (R = H, alkyl, aryl; A-B = H-H, sp C-H, sp2 C-H, sp3 C-H, C-X, X-C; X = halide) broad scope of these u bond metathesis processes, several of which have been utilized as convenient syntheses for some of the de- rivatives reported herein. The mechanisms of these reactions are fundamental to an understanding of the reaction chemistry of other oxidatively inert, electron-deficient compounds, particularly do and many dof" systems.
Our evidence relevant to the mechanisms of u bond metathesis with the permethylscandocene system points to a concerted, rather than stepwise, process. An appropriate model for the transition states of such u bond metathesis reactions must accommodate the observed order of reactivity of R-H bonds with Cp*,Sc-R' bonds
(R = R' = H >

Clearly, the rate decreases systematically with decrease in the s character of the reacting u bonds. The simplest possible picture,namely a four-center transition state, is indeed consistent with this feature.

The stability of the transition state should depend critically upon the s character of the valence orbitals of the atoms comprising the four centers: nondirectional orbitals provide better overlap,hence more bonding and more stability to the transition state.
Steigerwald and Goddards2 have carried out calculations on a model system, CI2Sc-H + H-H. Two of their findings are of particular interest in the present discussion:(i) The nodal properties of the scandium d orbitals are ideally suited to provide good overlap in the transition state with all three hydrogen atoms (4 centers, 4 electrons). Since the CI atoms (and by extension,the Cp* ligands for permethylscandocene derivatives) bond principally via the Sc 4s valence orbitals, the Sc-H bonding for C1,ScH is largely Sc(3d)-H( 1s) in character. Hence, the u bond metathesis, a formal 2s + 2s process, is orbitally allowed and energetically quite favorable due to the excellent bonding char- acteristics of the transition state. (ii) The optimal geometry for the transition state was found to be distinctly "kite-shaped'' rather than square, As a consequence, the H atom occupying the central (p) position relative to scandium bonds to both lateral hydrogen atoms but not to scandium.j3 Similar arguments have been (47).

(53) The d(Sc-H) distances are, in fact, identical (see ref 52); however,frontier orbital considerations reveal that no formal bond between the Sc and the P-H exists: the four electrons (one each from the three hydrogens and one from Sc) occupy the orbitals of la, and b, symmetry; the remaining orbital, of 2a, symmetry (that which is bonding with respect to Sc and the 8-H) is thus empty. u Bond Metathesis for Hydrocarbons + +

Vo[. 109, No. 1, 1987 215 Treatment of Cp*,ScCH2c6H, with benzene at 80  C  yields Cp*,ScC6H, (3) and toluene (no diphenylmethane and Cp*,ScH (6)),despite the fact that the latter (eq 49) is slightly favored by
0.5 (5) kcal-mol-I. Thus, kinetic control (i.e., a transition state
energy difference) does indeed appear to be governing the se- lectivities of these u bond metathesis  reaction.' Despite the apparent steric preference for the transition states for reactions 47 and 49, the much poorer overlap provided by the sp3 C orbital of R (vis-a-vis the s orbital of H) in the crucial center (p) position results in an overriding, unfavorable electronic effect. c a = 6Z0 0 = 750 7 = 1490 developed and further elaborated by Rappe and U p t  n .Moreover, these authors point out that an electron-deficient metal center with one or more vacant orbitals would provide a low-energy means of approach for the H-H or C-H bond to the Sc-R bond,a distinct advantage in accessing the Steigerwald-Goddard transition state.The picture which emerges for the mechanisms of these con- certed, u bond metathesis reactions involving electron-deficient metallocene derivatives is thus (i) approach of the H-H or C-H bond to the vacant la, orbital of C  * , S C - R ,(ii) formation of the transition state described above (eq 43) with H occupying the central (p) position in all cases, and (iii) departure of the new H-H or C-H u bond from the opposite side of the la, orbital.The preference for H to occupy the central ( 0 )
position in the transition state is easily reconciled by the model presented above.
The bond angle to the lateral atoms is largest for this position in the transition state (the top of the kite), and, accordingly, the preference for s (nondirectional) orbital character is maximum.
The resultant preference for [R] and [R] exchange between [Cp*,Sc] and [HI (eq 44) as opposed to coupling of [R] and [R] to afford Cp*,Sc-H and R-R (eq 45) can thus be attributed to Cp*,Sc-R + R-H e Cp*,Sc-R + R-H (44) Cp*,Sc-R + R-H Cp*&-H

The equilibration of Cp*,Sc-H,benzene, Cp*,Sc-C,H,,and H-H (eq 18) allows an estimate of the thermodynamics accompanying reactions 44 and 45 for R = alkyl and R = C6H,. Since the Cp*,Sc-H bond strength is
1.5 (4) kcal-mol- stronger than the Cp*,Sc-C6H, bond strength
(vide supra), the thermodynamics of the two processes can be approximated. For the reaction of Cp*,Sc-CH, with benzene,the two possible outcomes (eq 46 and 47) involve breaking the

The mechanism(s) for reaction of alkyl halides with alkyl de- rivatives of permethylscandocene are not yet understood. Radical pathways are likely alternatives to the concerted, four-center process outlined above, considering the prevalence of radical chain reactions between transition-metal complexes and alkyl halides., If the same concerted, four-center mechanism is, in fact, appli- cable, the two possible orientations of the C-X bond would appear to lead to comparable transition-state energies, since the alkyl exchange and alkyl-alkyl coupling reactions occur at approxi- mately the same rates. The lone electron pairs on the halogen 4 f

undoubtedly contribute to stability of both of these transition states,with the C-X moiety providing two orbitals and four electrons.
Transition state A, with X occupying the central bridging position,thus bears dose similarity to commonly encountered halogen- bridged structures. Transition-state B*,although suffering from placement of the poorly bridging sp3-hybridized carbon in the central position, gains considerably in stability from the Sc-X interaction. The latter four-center, six-electron arrangement would thus compare with the transition states for activation of the C-H bonds a to an oxygen or nitrogen donor atom (e.g., the a C-H bonds of T H F  and the ortho C-H bonds of pyridine). c

The higher reactivity of sp2- and sp-hybridized C-H bonds is attributed to increased bonding (Le., lower transition-state energy) in the transition state for these reactions, summarized in eq 43.
Implicit in this explanation is that the K systems of these substrates do not interact with the frontier orbitals of CP*SC-R along the reaction coordinate for u bond metathesis. The two bulky pen- tamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands likely block approach of the T orbitals for substituted olefins. Indeed, when the olefin is suf- ficiently small to allow interaction of its T system with Cp*,Sc-R,insertion, rather than u bond metathesis appears to occur, as in the polymerization of ethylene or the insertion of propene (eq 29).
(56) Although alkyl-alkyl coupling of alkanes to higher alkanes and di- hydrogen is slightly endothermic, it is apparently very much disfavored ki- netically: no homogeneous system which effects this transformation has been reported to our knowledge. An equally conspicuous challenge is the (exo- thermic) reverse: cleavage of carbon-carbon single bonds with dihydrogen to afford lower molecular weight hydrocarbons.

SOC., Vol. 109, No. I, 1987 The attack of Cp**Sc-R at the C-H bonds of arenes perpendicular to the K system has been convincingly demonstrated experimen- tally. Once again, sterics may be invoked to explain preferential attack of the Lewis acidic scandium center at the (lower energy and less extensive) C-H a orbital, since approach of the arene along this reaction coordinate places the arene ring in a much less crowded, nearly parallel orientation relative to the two ($-C5Me5) rings.
Steric interactions of substrate substituents with the bulky (q5-C5Me5) ligands may also be invoked to explain the striking preference for primary C-H bonds in H / D  exchange reactions catalyzed by Cp*,ScH (vide supra). With primary C-H bonds the lone substituent may be placed in the equatorial plane of the bent sandwich [CP*SC],whereas with secondary or tertiary C-H bonds, one or two unfavorable steric interactions between (v5- C5Me5) ligands and alkyl substituent(s) necessarily accompany the transition states of these u bond metathesis reactions. r -1* Thompson et al. were performed by using standard Toepler techniques, and the gases were identified by mass spectrometry or NMR.

alkyl) A significant and interesting question concerns the polarity of the transition states for these u bond metathesis reactions. In view of the electropositive character of the metals which effect these transformations, a highly polar transition state has normally been invoked.58 On the other hand, the facility of these reactions is nonpolar media (e.g., aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) and the Mulliken populations obtained by Goddard and Steigerwald for Sc and the H atoms in the transition state52 suggest a relatively nonpolar character. The insensitivity of the second-order rate constants for the reaction of Cp*,ScCH, with substituted arenes (eq 36) to the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating nature of the substituents might be taken to support the latter view;however, the effect of these substituents on the polarity of the ortho, meta, and para C-H bonds is only minimal. Indeed, an alternative explanation for the order of reactivity (sp-C-H > sp2-C-H > sp3-C-H) could invoke a highly polar transition state,since hydrocarbon acidity59 does indeed follow precisely this same order.60 Since both explanations invoke higher reactivity with higher s character, a distinction between the two and, hence, a decision concerning the polarity of the transition states for bond metathesis must await further experiments. At present, we favor a relatively nonpolar concerted process with the electrophilic scandium attacking the reacting u bond in a relatively symmetric fashion. We admit, however, that our experimental results do not require this interpretation.

Reaction of Cp*,Sc(C,N-q2-C,H,N) with Pyridine-d,. An NMR tube containing 0.025 g of 11 (0.064 mmol) and 0.026 mL of pyridine-d, (0.32 mmol, 5 equiv) dissolved in 0.35 mL of benzene-d6 was sealed with a torch. After 2 days at room temperature the pyridyl ligand had been converted to o-pyridine-d, ('H NMR), while the Cp* resonance remained unchanged.H / D  Exchange between Cp*,sc-D and C6H6 (eq 13). Compound 5 (33 mg, 0.081 mmol) was dissolved in 0.3 mL of benzene-d6 and placed under 2 atm of D,. The solution was stirred for IO min and then cooled to -78 OC. Benzene-d, was sublimed from the reaction under reduced pressure as the solid was allowed to warm. The resulting solid was dissolved in 0.4 mL of C,H, and transferred to an N M R  tube. After 5 min at room temperature the tube was cooled to -78 OC and charged with 0.098 mmol of CH,I. The tube was sealed and warmed to room temperature. The ' H  N M R  spectrum showed resonances assignable to Cp*,Scl and CH4; CH,D was not observed.A small amount of Cp*,ScC6H, (5% relative to Cp*,ScI) was observed.H / D  Exchange for Cyclopentane. A 5-mm N M R  tube was charged with 8 mg of 1 (0.024 mmol), 50 pL of cyclopentane (0.53 mmol), 0.35 mL of benzene-d,, and 700 torr of H, (3.6 atm at 25 "C). The entire tube (open to the 700 torr H, source) was cooled to -196 OC and sealed with a torch. The tube was heated at 120 OC for 26 days, and the reaction solution was examined by GC/MS. Comparison with the mass spectrum of a cyclopentane standard indicated 17% monodeuteriation,corresponding to a turn over rate of ca. 0.06 turnovers/day.
Equilibration of Cp*,ScH or Cp*,ScH(THF), C,H,, Cp*,ScC,H,, and H, (eq 18 and 19). The sample used in equilibrium studies between Cp*,ScH and Cp*,ScC,HS (eq 18) was prepared in an N M R  tube fused to a Kontes Teflon stoppered valve, which was fitted with a standard taper joint for attaching to a vacuum line. The tube was charged with 18 mg of 2 (0.054 mmol) and 0.5 mL of C6H,. The entire N M R  tube was cooled to -196 OC. H, (700 torr) was introduced into the tube, and 10 minutes was allowed for the gas to come to thermal equilibrium. The Kontes valve was closed, and the tube was warmed to 25 OC. The tube was removed from the vacuum line and shaken for 5 min to ensure formation of Cp*,ScH. The tube was connected to the vacuum line and cooled to -196 "C, the hydrogen was removed in vacuo, and the tube was sealed with a torch.
To study the equilibration between Cp*,Sc(THF)H and C6H6 (eq 19) a C6H6 solution of an isolated sample of Cp*,Sc(THF)H was sealed in an N M R  tube.
The experiments at 25 "C and higher temperatures were carried out in a constant temperature oil bath (fO.l "C), which was heated with a Precision Scientific Co. thermostated water circulator. The samples were fully submerged in the bath and agitated to facilitate the equilibration of H2 between the solution and gas phases. The experiments carried out at 6 OC were performed in a cold room at this temperature.

Preparation of (Cp*-d,,),ScCH,.
A 50-mL, thick-walled glass bomb with a fused Teflon needle valve was charged with 4 g of Cp*,ScCH, (2) (12 mmol), I O  mL of benzene-d, (>99.5% D), and 2 atm of D,. The bomb was heated at 80 "C for 1 day. The gas (H2, HD, D,, and CH3D) was removed, and 1 atm of D2 was admitted. After heating at 115 "C for 24 h, the gas mixture and benzene were removed in vacuo, and benzene-d6 (20 mL) and D, (1 atm) were added. After heating an additional 24 h at 115 "C, the cycle was repeated one more time with fresh benzene-d6 (35 mL) and D2 (1 atm). The bomb was cooled to -78 OC, 12 mmol of CH,Cl, were condensed in, 1 atm of H2 was added, and the mixture was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature. After 5 min, volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was recrystallized at -78 OC from diethyl ether/petroleum ether to afford 2.73 g (62%) of yellow (Cp*-dl,),ScC1 The amount of proton impurity was determined ('H N M R  integration vs. ferrocene) to be <0.2%'.

The sample was heated at 80 OC. The kinetics of intramolecular C-H activation were followed by 'H NMR, monitoring the decrease in integrated intensity of the Sc-CH, resonance relative to internal cyclooctane. The kinetics of intramolecular C-D activation were examined in the same manner substituting 2-d3, in place of 2.Kinetic Measurements for the Reaction of Cp*,ScCH, with I3CH, (eq 26). Compound 2 ( I O  mg, 0.03 mmol), cyclohexane-d,, (0.5 mL), and
0.6-5.0 mmmol of "CH, were sealed in 5-mm medium-walled NMR
tubes (Wilmad Enc., 524-p). At 70 OC approximately 20% of the CH4 was in solution; accurate ( f 5 8 )  concentrations were obtained with cy- clooctane as an internal integration standard. Plots of -In[Sc-CH,] vs. time were linear over 2-5 half-lives (depending on the ratio of 12C:13C in the system) with excess "CH,.
Only data from the first 20-30% of the reaction was considered. In roughly 20% of these experiments kobsd was 3-4 times larger than expected. Repeating the experiment generally gave a value of kobsd consistent with those observed at other concentra- tions of methane. We attribute this rate increase to a small amount of some (unidentified) catalyst promoting the reaction.
The reaction chemistry exhibited by the tucked-in complex 12 (vide supra) suggests that it may be the catalyst. This apparent catalysis was most common in aged samples of 2, for which some thermal decomposition could have given rise to a small amount of 12. trans-Cp*,ScCH=CH(p-C,",).

Hydrogen atom positions were de- termined by assuming idealized geometry and by locating peaks in the difference map.
The pyridyl ligand is disordered and results in the complete superpo- sition of two pyridyl groups of equal population. To model this, all atoms in the pyridyl group were given full populations, except for the two atoms bound to Sc, which were each modeled as 50% carbon and 50% nitrogen atom.

An orthorhombic cell was found, and cell dimensions were obtained from a least-squares fit to the setting angles of 15 reflections (various forms of six independent reflec- tions) with 20" < 28 < 2 6 ' .Systematic absences observed in the data of hOO, h = 2n + 1, OkO, k = 2n + 1, and 001,l = 2n + 1 are-mique for the sea_ce group no. 19,

Three check reflections monitored every 97 reflections showed linear decay of 1.5% in F over the 230 h required to collect the data. The data were corrected for this decay and reduced to F:; variances were assigned as described above. The least-squares refinement used all 2076 data and minimized the quantity Zw(F2 -

No absorption correction was made because of the small value of krmax.
A Patterson map gave scan- dium coordinates, and successive structure factor-Fourier calculations located the remaining atoms. Hydrogen atoms on the Cp* methyl groups were introduced, based on difference maps calculated in the planes where they were expected, and included in the subsequent calculations as con- stant contributions to the structure factors, with isotroplc B of 10.0
A2.
Six cycles of full matrix least squares, the hydrogen atoms being repo- sitioned two times, concluded the refinement; the final R = 0.1 13 for all the data with F: > 0 and 0.072 for data with F: > 3u(F?). The goodness of fit was S = 2.98,where n = number of data = 2076 and p = number of parameters. In the final refinement no parameter shifted more than one-half its standard deviation. A final difference map showed no excursion greater than f0.44 e/A3. Crystal data are given in Table VI11 and atom coordinates in Table X. Calculations were done by using the programs of the CRYRM crystallographic computing system64 on a VAX 11/780 computer; the final drawing was done by using ORTEP.65
