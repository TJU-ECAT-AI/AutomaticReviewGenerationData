<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document does not contain specific details about the preparation, structure, catalytic properties, mechanisms in H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, or roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking for silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. Therefore, an accurate comparison cannot be provided based on the given information.
