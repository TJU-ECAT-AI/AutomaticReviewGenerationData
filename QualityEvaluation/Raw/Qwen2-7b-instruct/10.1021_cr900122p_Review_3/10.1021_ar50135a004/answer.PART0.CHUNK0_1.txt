[1] "The enzymes that mediate these transformations can be induced or inhibited by environmental modifiers."
[2] "Specific induction of a-hydroxylation could lead to greater carcinogenic activity; the modifier causing this would act as a cocarcinogen."
[3] "Similarly, specific inhibition of a-hydroxylation could have a protective effect against carcinogenesis by these nitrosamines."

The enzymes that mediate the transformations of tobacco-specific nitrosamines can be influenced by environmental modifiers. Induction of a-hydroxylation might increase carcinogenic activity, potentially acting as a cocarcinogen. Conversely, inhibition of a-hydroxylation could offer protection against carcinogenesis by these substances.
