[1] "The results described in this review indicate that the tobacco-specific carcinogens, NNN and NNK, may be causative factors in the various cancers associated with tobacco usage."
[2] "These nitrosamines are derived predominantly from the major tobacco alkaloid, nicotine, by nitrosation during the curing and smoking of tobacco."
[3] "Since NNN and NNK form during curing, it is feasible to reduce their concentrations in tobacco by appropriate management of the curing and related processes."
[4] "A second approach begins with an understanding of the metabolic activation and detoxification of tobacco-specific nitrosamines."
[5] "Specific induction of a-hydroxylation could lead to greater carcinogenic activity; the modifier causing this would act as a cocarcinogen."

The document discusses the potential role of tobacco-specific nitrosamines, particularly NNN and NNK, as causative factors in various cancers associated with tobacco usage. These nitrosamines are primarily derived from the major tobacco alkaloid, nicotine, through nitrosation during the curing and smoking of tobacco. Reducing the concentrations of NNN and NNK in tobacco and tobacco smoke is one approach to decrease the risk of tobacco-related cancers. Understanding the metabolic activation and detoxification of these nitrosamines can lead to the development of strategies to inhibit the formation of a-hydroxylation, which might have a protective effect against carcinogenesis.

The document also mentions that specific modifiers, such as those that induce a-hydroxylation, could act as cocarcinogens, potentially increasing the carcinogenic activity of NNN and NNK. This highlights the importance of identifying and studying these modifiers through metabolic studies and bioassays to better understand the causative factors in tobacco carcinogenesis and prevent tobacco-related cancer.

文档讨论了烟草特异性硝基胺，尤其是NNN和NNK，在与烟草使用相关的各种癌症中的潜在致病因素。这些硝基胺主要来源于主要的烟草生物碱尼古丁，在烟草的发酵和吸烟过程中通过硝化形成。通过调整发酵和相关过程，可以降低烟草中NNN和NNK的浓度，从而减少与烟草相关的癌症风险。理解这些硝基胺的代谢激活和解毒可以为开发减少其形成的方法提供策略，这可能对预防癌症有保护作用。

文档还提到，特定的调节剂，如促进a-羟基化的作用，可能会作为共致癌物增加NNN和NNK的致癌活性。这强调了通过代谢研究和生物试验识别和研究这些调节剂的重要性，以更好地理解烟草致癌的因素，并防止与烟草有关的癌症。
