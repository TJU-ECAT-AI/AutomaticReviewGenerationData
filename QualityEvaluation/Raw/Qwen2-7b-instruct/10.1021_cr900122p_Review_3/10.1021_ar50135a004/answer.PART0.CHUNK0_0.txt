[4] "A second approach begins with an understanding of the metabolic activation and detoxification of tobacco-specific nitrosamines."
[5] "Specific induction of a-hydroxylation could lead to greater carcinogenic activity; the modifier causing this would act as a cocarcinogen."

The document discusses the potential role of tobacco-specific carcinogens, such as NNN and NNK, in causing various cancers associated with tobacco usage. It suggests that by managing the curing and smoking processes, the concentrations of these carcinogens in tobacco and tobacco smoke can be reduced, potentially lowering the risk of tobacco-related cancers. Understanding the metabolic activation and detoxification of these nitrosamines could lead to the development of modifiers that either increase or decrease their carcinogenic effects. Specifically, inducing a-hydroxylation could enhance carcinogenic activity, acting as a cocarcinogen, whereas inhibiting a-hydroxylation might offer protection against carcinogenesis.

文献讨论了烟草特异性致癌物，如NNN和NNK，在与烟草使用相关的各种癌症中的潜在作用。它建议通过管理烘烤和吸烟过程，降低烟草和烟草烟雾中这些致癌物的浓度，可能降低与烟草有关的癌症风险。理解这些硝基胺的代谢激活和解毒可以导致开发出能够增加或减少其致癌效果的修饰剂。具体而言，诱导a-羟基化可能会增强致癌活性，作为共致癌物发挥作用；而抑制a-羟基化可能提供对抗这些硝基胺致癌性的保护作用。
