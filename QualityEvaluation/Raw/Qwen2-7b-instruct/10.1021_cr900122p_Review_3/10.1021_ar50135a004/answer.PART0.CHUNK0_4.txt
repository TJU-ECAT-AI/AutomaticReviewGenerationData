98 Schrock Accounts of Chemical Research phenylhydrazones 24 and 25. When rats were treated with NNN, 73-8570 of the dose was excreted in the urine, but 20 and 21 were not detected. However,products of further oxidation of 20 and 21, the keto acid 23, hydroxy acid 26, and lactone 27 were isolated. The formation of 20 and 21 in vitro is most readily explained by initial 2-hydroxylation or 5-hydroxylation of NNN,as indicated in Scheme IV. The metabolites 23, 26, and 27 were formed, at least partially, by metabolic oxi- dation of 20 and 21.
