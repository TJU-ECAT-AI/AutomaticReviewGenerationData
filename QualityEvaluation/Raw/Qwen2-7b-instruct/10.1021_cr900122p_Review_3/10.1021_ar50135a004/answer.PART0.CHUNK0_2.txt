The document discusses the potential causative role of tobacco-specific carcinogens, specifically NNN and NNK, in various cancers associated with tobacco usage. It suggests that by reducing the concentrations of these and related nitrosamines in tobacco and tobacco smoke, the risk of tobacco-related cancers can be mitigated. Furthermore, the document indicates that specific induction or inhibition of a-hydroxylation, a metabolic process involving NNN and NNK, could influence the carcinogenic activity of these compounds. Induction of a-hydroxylation might enhance carcinogenic activity, acting as a cocarcinogen, whereas inhibition could potentially protect against carcinogenesis.

文献讨论了特定于烟草的致癌物，尤其是NNN和NNK，在与烟草使用相关的各种癌症中的潜在致病因素。它提出通过减少烟草和烟草烟雾中这些和相关硝基化合物的浓度，可以降低与烟草有关的癌症风险。此外，文献表明特定诱导或抑制α羟化作用，涉及NNN和NNK的代谢过程，可能会影响这些化合物的致癌性。诱导α羟化作用可能会增强致癌活性，作为共致癌物起作用，而抑制则可能有助于保护免受这些硝基化合物引起的癌变。
