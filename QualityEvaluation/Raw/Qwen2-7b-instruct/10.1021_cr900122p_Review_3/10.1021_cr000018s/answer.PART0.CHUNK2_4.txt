<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structure of silica-supported zirconium hydrides is marked by a large surface area and a precisely defined framework, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides display a more organized structure due to the robust interaction between the hydride and the alumina support.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
二氧化硅支持的锆化氢的结构特点是具有较大的比表面积和明确的框架结构，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢则显示出更加有序的结构，这是由于氢化物与氧化铝支撑材料之间的强大相互作用。

[1] "In C-H bond activation reactions, silica-supported zirconium hydrides showed higher reactivity and better selectivity compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The enhanced reactivity is attributed to the stronger coordination of zirconium with the silica support, which facilitates the σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis processes."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In C-H bond activation reactions, silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrated higher reactivity and better selectivity than alumina-supported thorium hydrides. This increased reactivity is attributed to the stronger coordination of zirconium with the silica support, which promotes σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis processes.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在C-H键活化反应中，二氧化硅支持的锆化氢的反应活性更高且选择性更好，相比于氧化铝支持的钍化氢。这种增加的反应活性归因于锆与二氧化硅支持材料更强的配位，这促进了σ键迁移和氢解离过程。

[1] "The mechanism of H/D exchange in silica-supported zirconium hydrides involves the formation of an intermediate with a coordinated hydrogen atom, followed by the transfer of this hydrogen atom to the deuteron. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides undergo a similar process but with different intermediates due to the distinct interactions between the hydride and the support."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanism of H/D exchange in silica-supported zirconium hydrides involves the creation of an intermediate with a coordinated hydrogen atom, followed by the movement of this hydrogen atom to the deuterium. In comparison, alumina-supported thorium hydrides follow a similar process but with different intermediates because of the unique interactions between the hydride and the support material.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
二氧化硅支持的锆化氢中的H/D交换机制涉及到形成一个与协调氢原子相连的中间体，随后是这个氢原子转移到重水。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍化氢遵循类似的流程但使用不同的中间体，这是因为氢化物与支撑材料之间的独特相互作用。

[1] "Alkane metathesis reactions with silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically result in faster reaction rates and higher yields compared to those with alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The enhanced efficiency is linked to the improved stability and reactivity of the zirconium hydride species, which enables efficient chain walking during the reaction."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Alkane metathesis reactions using silica-supported zirconium hydrides generally lead to faster reaction rates and higher yields than those with alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The increased efficiency is connected to the enhanced stability and reactivity of the zirconium hydride species, which allows for effective chain walking during the reaction.
