The literature does not provide specific details on the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, nor do they discuss their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided information.
