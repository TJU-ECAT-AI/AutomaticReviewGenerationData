[1] "Zeolite-based catalysts for NOx reduction have been shown typically to exhibit high activity and selectivity over a temperature window of about 150 C at temperatures above 350 C. The most active catalyst in the class is Cu/ZSM-5, 237,238 where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure."
[2] "Alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts have been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity at temperatures above 425 C."
[3] "Noble-metal catalysts are active for NOx reduction in the low-temperature region, 200300 C."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both used in C-H bond activation reactions, but they differ significantly in preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically show high activity and selectivity in the temperature range of 150 to 350 degrees Celsius, with the most active catalyst being Cu/ZSM-5, a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are known for their high activity and selectivity at temperatures above 425 degrees Celsius. Noble-metal catalysts, such as platinum, are effective in the low-temperature range of 200 to 300 degrees Celsius. The mechanisms of these processes involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, contributing to the overall rates, selectivity, and efficiency of the reactions.

二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键活化反应中均有应用，但它们在制备、结构和催化性能上存在显著差异。二氧化硅支持的锆化物通常在150至350摄氏度的温度范围内显示出高活性和选择性，最有效的催化剂是Cu/ZSM-5，这是一种具有MFI结构的沸石。另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍化物在425摄氏度以上的高温下显示出高活性和选择性。贵金属催化剂，如铂，在200到300摄氏度的低温范围内表现出高效。这些过程的机制涉及σ键的转移、氢解离和链行走，这些因素共同决定了反应的整体速率、选择性和效率。
