The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions differ significantly. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically exhibit high activity and selectivity over a temperature window of about 150 C at temperatures above 350 C. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides show high activity and selectivity at temperatures above 425 C. Noble-metal catalysts are active for NOx reduction in the low-temperature region, 200300 C.

对于C-H键活化反应，硅基支撑锆化氢和氧化铝基支撑钍化氢的制备、结构和催化性质存在显著差异。硅基支撑锆化氢通常在高于350°C的温度窗口内展现出高活性和选择性，约为150°C。另一方面，氧化铝基支撑钍化氢在高于425°C的温度下表现出高活性和选择性。贵金属催化剂在200至300°C的低温区域对NOx还原具有活性。
