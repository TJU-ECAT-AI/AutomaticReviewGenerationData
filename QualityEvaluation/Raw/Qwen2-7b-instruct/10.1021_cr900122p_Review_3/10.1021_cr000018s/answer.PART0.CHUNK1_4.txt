Scheme 13. Artificial Photosynthesis for CO2 Reduction with Ru(bpy)32+

The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17

The aforementioned molecular sensitizers can be replaced with semiconductor electrodes or particles to achieve light harvesting. These systems may use enzymes or catalysts to promote electron transfer from the semiconductorsolution interface to CO2 or reduce CO2 directly.178,179

Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less.

Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described.

In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.177

In some cases with Ru or Os colloids, CH4 is produced with a low quantum yield.164

These systems produce formate and CO as products.

In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, it is evident that the two materials exhibit distinct characteristics. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides tend to have a more open structure, allowing for better access of substrates and facilitating the formation of active intermediates. These materials are typically prepared through co-precipitation or impregnation methods, where zirconium hydride is loaded onto the silica support.

On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides feature a more ordered structure due to the nature of the alumina support. This structure aids in stabilizing the thorium hydrides and potentially influencing the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Preparation involves loading thorium hydrides onto alumina through methods such as impregnation or sol-gel techniques. The alumina support plays a crucial role in enhancing the thermal stability and resistance to poisoning, which are essential attributes for C-H bond activation reactions.

In terms of mechanisms, both materials participate in C-H bond activation through processes like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. However, the selectivity and reaction rates might vary significantly. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are known for their ability to activate C-H bonds with high selectivity, primarily due to the synergistic effects between the zirconium hydride and silica support. This system facilitates the formation of active intermediates that undergo subsequent hydrogenolysis or metathesis reactions to produce desired products.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, demonstrate enhanced stability and resistance to deactivation, making them suitable for challenging C-H bond activation reactions. The ordered structure of the alumina support helps maintain the integrity of the thorium hydrides under harsh reaction conditions, leading to improved reaction rates and yields. However, the selectivity might be influenced by the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the substrates.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides offer distinct advantages in C-H bond activation reactions. The former is characterized by high selectivity and ease of substrate access, while the latter boasts enhanced stability and resistance to deactivation, making both materials valuable in the realm of catalysis. Further exploration of the underlying mechanisms and optimization of reaction conditions could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for C-H bond activation.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性能，可以看出这两种材料表现出明显的差异。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物倾向于具有更开放的结构，便于底物的接近，促进活性中间体的形成。这些材料通常通过共沉淀或浸渍方法制备，其中锆氢化物负载在二氧化硅载体上。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物具有更有序的结构，这是由于氧化铝载体的性质决定的。这种结构有助于稳定钍氢化物，并可能影响催化性能和选择性。制备过程包括通过浸渍或溶胶-凝胶技术将钍氢化物负载到氧化铝上。氧化铝支持对于增强热稳定性以及抗中毒能力至关重要，这对于C-H键活化反应至关重要。

在机制方面，两种材料均通过σ键互换、氢解离和链行走等过程参与C-H键活化。然而，选择性和反应速率可能有很大差异。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物因其zr-hydride与二氧化硅支持之间的协同作用而显示出高选择性，主要归因于其易于底物接入的特点。这个系统促进了活性中间体的形成，随后进行氢解离或互换反应以生成所需产物。

氧化铝支持的钍氢化物则展现出增强的稳定性和抗失活能力，使其适合于挑战性的C-H键活化反应。氧化铝支持结构有助于维持在苛刻反应条件下钍氢化物的完整性，从而提高反应速率和产率。然而，选择性可能受到特定反应条件和底物性质的影响。

总之，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中提供了不同的优势。前者以其高选择性和易于底物接入而著称，后者则以其增强的稳定性和抗失活能力而闻名，使这两种材料在催化领域具有重要价值。进一步探索潜在的机制并优化反应条件可以推动开发更加高效和选择性的催化剂，用于C-H键活化。
