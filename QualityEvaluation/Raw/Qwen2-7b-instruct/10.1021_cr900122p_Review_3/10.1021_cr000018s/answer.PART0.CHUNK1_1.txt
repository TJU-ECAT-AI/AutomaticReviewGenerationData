1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides have distinct properties that influence their usage in C-H bond activation reactions. Zirconium hydrides are characterized by their high surface area and good dispersion of zirconium species, making them suitable for H/D exchange reactions with high selectivity towards deuterium incorporation. Thorium hydrides, with their more stable matrix and capability to withstand higher temperatures, are often employed in alkane metathesis reactions, which involve rearrangements of alkyl groups. Both types of hydrides participate in C-H bond activation through mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides can engage in chain walking and hydrogenolysis, aiding in H/D exchange. Conversely, alumina-supported thorium hydrides promote alkane metathesis through facilitation of alkyl group rearrangements.

2. In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides are advantageous for H/D exchange reactions due to their high selectivity and ability to undergo chain walking and hydrogenolysis. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are better suited for alkane metathesis, which involves rearranging alkyl groups, thanks to their temperature stability and ability to promote such rearrangements.

1. 硅基支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝基支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中表现出不同的特性。锆氢化物以其高比表面积和良好的锆物种分散性而闻名，常用于具有高氘选择性的H/D交换反应。钍氢化物则由于其稳定的基质和能承受更高温度的能力，通常应用于需要高温稳定性的烷烃异构化反应，这种反应涉及烷基团的重排。这两种氢化物通过σ键异构化、氢解离和链行走等机制参与C-H键激活过程。硅基支持的锆氢化物能够进行链行走和氢解离，促进H/D交换。相反，氧化铝基支持的钍氢化物通过促进烷基团重排来促进烷烃异构化。

2. 总之，硅基支持的锆氢化物由于其高选择性和进行链行走和氢解离的能力，非常适合于H/D交换反应。氧化铝基支持的钍氢化物由于其温度稳定性以及促进烷基团重排的能力，更适合于烷烃异构化，这涉及烷基团的重新排列。
