<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are compared in the context of C-H bond activation reactions. These reactions involve H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, with a focus on understanding the mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The rate of reactions and their selectivity are discussed, highlighting the roles of these catalytic processes.
