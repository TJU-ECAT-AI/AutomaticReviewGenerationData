The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions have been extensively studied. The mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis have been clarified. The report discusses reaction rates, selectivity, and the functions of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.
