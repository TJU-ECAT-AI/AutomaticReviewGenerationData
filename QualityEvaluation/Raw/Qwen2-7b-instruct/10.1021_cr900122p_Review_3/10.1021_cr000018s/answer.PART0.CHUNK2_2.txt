[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides have been widely used in C-H bond activation reactions due to their high surface area and thermal stability."
[2] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, offer an alternative platform for C-H bond activation, providing a different set of properties compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides."
[3] "In H/D exchange reactions, silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically show faster reaction rates than their alumina counterparts, attributed to the higher reactivity of zirconium hydrides."
[4] "For alkane metathesis, the selectivity of silica-supported zirconium hydrides is generally higher, leading to more controlled and specific alkane rearrangements."
[5] "The mechanism of H/D exchange in these materials involves the formation of an active site where hydrogen atoms are transferred from the solvent to the alkane molecule."
[6] "In alkane metathesis, the process often involves the breaking of σ-bonds followed by hydrogenolysis, which allows for the rearrangement of alkane chains."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are two types of catalysts used in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides offer a high surface area and thermal stability, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides provide an alternative platform with distinct properties. In H/D exchange reactions, silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit faster reaction rates, thanks to the higher reactivity of zirconium hydrides. For alkane metathesis, silica-supported zirconium hydrides display higher selectivity, resulting in more controlled and specific alkane rearrangements. The mechanism of H/D exchange involves the formation of an active site where hydrogen atoms are transferred from the solvent to the alkane molecule. In alkane metathesis, the process involves the breaking of σ-bonds followed by hydrogenolysis, allowing for the rearrangement of alkane chains.

硅基载锆氢化物和氧化铝基载钍氢化物是两种用于C-H键活化的催化剂。硅基载锆氢化物提供高表面积和热稳定性，而氧化铝基载钍氢化物提供了具有不同特性的替代平台。在H/D交换反应中，硅基载锆氢化物显示出更快的反应速率，这是由于锆氢化物的更高活性。对于烷烃裂合，硅基载锆氢化物的择优性较高，导致更可控和特定的烷烃重排。H/D交换的机制涉及形成一个活性位点，在该位点上溶剂中的氢原子转移到烷烃分子上。在烷烃裂合过程中，过程涉及σ键的断裂后氢解离，这允许烷烃链的重排。
