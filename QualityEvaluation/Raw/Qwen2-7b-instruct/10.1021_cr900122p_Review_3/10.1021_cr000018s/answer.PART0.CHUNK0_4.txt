[1] "There are two major pathways for carbon formation: The tendency to form carbon on the catalyst surface depends on reaction kinetics, process conditions (temperature, pressure flow rates), and reformer design."
[2] "In H2 production, there are always concerns with regard to carbon formation 22 which can build rapidly and poison the process. Carbon leads to fouling (clogging) of the reactor and blocks active sites on the catalyst, and thus it is important to inhibit carbon formation."
[3] "Formation of carbon (coke) during the process is a critical issue that impacts performance and lifetime of commercial catalysts."
[4] "Typically, excess steam-to-hydrocarbon (3/1) is used to minimize coke formation on commercial catalysts."
[5] "By sulfur catalyst passivation (continual addition of trace levels of sulfur compounds to the feed) or by the incorporation of noble metals, it is also possible to minimize carbon formation."

In steam reforming of hydrocarbons, carbon formation is a significant concern. The formation of carbon on the catalyst surface is influenced by reaction kinetics, process conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates, as well as reformer design. This can lead to the buildup of carbon, which can clog the reactor and block active sites on the catalyst, thus impacting the performance and lifetime of commercial catalysts. To minimize carbon formation, excess steam-to-hydrocarbon ratios (typically 3:1) are used. Additionally, sulfur catalyst passivation, where trace levels of sulfur compounds are continuously added to the feed, or the incorporation of noble metals can also help reduce carbon formation.

在蒸汽重整烃类过程中，碳沉积是一个主要问题。催化剂表面的碳沉积受到反应动力学、过程条件（如温度、压力和流速）以及重整器设计的影响。这可能导致碳积累，堵塞反应器并阻塞催化剂上的活性位点，从而影响催化剂的性能和寿命。为了减少碳沉积，通常使用过量的蒸汽与烃类的比例（通常是3:1）。此外，通过向原料中持续添加微量硫化合物进行硫化催化剂处理，或加入贵金属也可以帮助减少碳沉积。

[1] "In the case of propane conversion to propene, the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2 (eqs 911)."
[2] "While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion."
[3] "Knowledge of these relationships would be very useful for guiding the modification of existing catalysts and for the synthesis of totally new classes of catalysts."

For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene without burning propane or propene to CO2 (equations 9-11). While many oxide catalysts demonstrate high selectivity for alkene production (e.g., over 80%) at very low conversion levels of the alkane, they show a decrease in alkene selectivity as the alkane conversion increases. Understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance would be very beneficial for modifying existing catalysts and synthesizing entirely new classes of catalysts.

对于丙烷转化为丙烯的过程，核心问题是如何在不燃烧丙烷或丙烯的情况下实现高产率的丙烯（等式9-11）。尽管许多氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化率非常低时显示出高烯烃选择性（例如超过80%），但随着烷烃转化率的增加，烯烃选择性会降低。了解催化剂结构与性能之间的关系将非常有利于修改现有催化剂并合成全新的催化剂类别。
