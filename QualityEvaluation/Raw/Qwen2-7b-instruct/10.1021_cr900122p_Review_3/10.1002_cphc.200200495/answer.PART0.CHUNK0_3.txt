[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl com-plexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,[1]"
[2] "yields of free-base porphyrins to be less than 1% of those of the porphyrin complexes."
[3] "The phosphorescence emission of the complex at 300 K and of ligand at 77 K or 300 K did not appear."
[4] "In conclusion, we have prepared the first series of lanthan-ide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals and demonstrated the application of cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements in the analysis of hexagonal liquid crystals."

The document does not provide specific details about the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it does discuss the use of early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl complexes in exchange reactions, particularly noting that they readily react with alkanes and hydrogen at low temperatures. It also mentions the synthesis of lanthanide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals and the application of various analytical techniques in their study.

文档没有提供关于二氧化硅负载的锆化物和氧化铝负载的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的具体制备、结构和催化性质。但是，它确实讨论了早期d0过渡金属或镧系氢化物或烷基复合物在交换反应中的使用，特别是指出它们能够在低温下与烷烃和氢气反应。它还提到了镧系(III)苯并卟啉液晶的合成，并在他们的研究中应用了各种分析技术。
