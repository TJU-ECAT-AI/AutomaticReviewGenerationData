[1] "This Emmons coupling provided about an 8:1 mixture of olefin stereoisomers in favoi- of /w?.>-17."

[2] "The instability of the nitridoneopentylidene complex [N=Mo(CHtBu)(CH,tBu)] presumably formed in situ is demonstrated by the immediate degradation by elimination of the neopentylidene coupling product 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hex-ene."

[3] "The catalytic activity of the immobilized species 4 in olefin metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization was compared with the homogeneous precursor compound 1."

[4] "The surface grafting of 1 on the partially dehydroxylated silica surface results in a strong enhancement of the catalytic activity as shown in Table 1."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not discussed in the provided literature. Therefore, there is no comparison, structure, or catalytic property information available for these materials in relation to C-H bond activation reactions, H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking.

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在文献中没有提及，因此无法比较它们在C-H键活化反应、H/D交换、烷烃裂合、反应速率、选择性、σ键裂合、氢解离或链行走方面的特性和性质。
