[1] "This Emmons coupling provided about an 8:1 mixture of olefin stereoisomers in favor of /w?-.>-17."
[2] "While the mechanistic features of olefin metathesis have been elucidated in much detail."
[3] "The instability of the nitridoneopentylidene complex [N=Mo(CHtBu)(CH,tBu)] presumably formed in situ is demonstrated by the immediate degradation by elimination of the neopentylidene coupling product 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hexene."
[4] "The oxyfunctionalization of 1 demonstrates that this molecule exhibits ideal prerequisites for surface grafting, both from the molecular structure (low-coordinate molybdenum) and the electronic structure (electron-deficient metal center)."
[5] "The evolution of neopentane during the surface reaction is indicative of a further reaction step."
[6] "This result gives strong evidence that the detachment of one hydrocarbon equivalent from the metal is a α-hydrogen abstraction step subsequent to the initial grafting process of Equation (c)."
[7] "The concept of organometallic surface catalysis experienced its breakthrough when metal alkyls based on tantalum or zirconium were used as molecular precursors."
[8] "In our case, all alkyl groups first remain at the metal since the acidic surface silanols attack the nitridomolybdenum moiety, whereas only in the second step an I-elimination occurs, yielding the corresponding alkylidene species."

The document does not provide sufficient information to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of a specific molybdenum-based complex, its surface grafting, and its use in olefin metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization. There is no information provided on silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document also does not discuss mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

文档没有提供足够的信息来比较和对比二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。它讨论了特定钼基复合物的制备、结构和催化性质，其表面接枝以及在烯烃裂合和环开裂聚合中的应用。文档中也没有关于二氧化硅支持的锆化氢或氧化铝支持的钍化氢的信息。文档也不讨论氢氘交换或烷烃裂解的机制，反应速率、选择性，或者σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走在这些过程中的作用。
