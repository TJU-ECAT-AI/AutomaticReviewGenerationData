Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

There are no specific details comparing and contrasting the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions within the provided document. The document discusses the synthesis and properties of molybdenum complexes and imidazolium salts, not zirconium or thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation contexts.

This document focuses on the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of a specific molybdenum compound, specifically a nitridomolybdenum(v) complex, in olefin metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization reactions. It does not compare or discuss silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions.

[2] "The instability of the nitridoneopentylidene complex [N=Mo(CHtBu)(CH,tBu)] presumably formed in situ is demonstrated by the immediate degradation by elimination of the neopentylidene coupling product 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hex-ene."

[3] "The catalytic activity of the immobilized species 4 in olefin metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization was compared with the homogeneous precursor compound 1."

[4] "The surface grafting of 1 on the partially dehydroxylated silica surface results in a strong enhancement of the catalytic activity as shown in Table 1."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not discussed in the provided literature. Therefore, there is no comparison, structure, or catalytic property information available for these materials in relation to C-H bond activation reactions, H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在文献中没有提及，因此无法比较它们在C-H键活化反应、H/D交换、烷烃裂合、反应速率、选择性、σ键裂合、氢解离或链行走方面的特性和性质。

[4] "The oxyfunctionalization of 1 demonstrates that this molecule exhibits ideal prerequisites for surface grafting, both from the molecular structure (low-coordinate molybdenum) and the electronic structure (electron-deficient metal center)."
[5] "The evolution of neopentane during the surface reaction is indicative of a further reaction step."
[6] "This result gives strong evidence that the detachment of one hydrocarbon equivalent from the metal is a α-hydrogen abstraction step subsequent to the initial grafting process of Equation (c)."
[7] "The concept of organometallic surface catalysis experienced its breakthrough when metal alkyls based on tantalum or zirconium were used as molecular precursors."
[8] "In our case, all alkyl groups first remain at the metal since the acidic surface silanols attack the nitridomolybdenum moiety, whereas only in the second step an I-elimination occurs, yielding the corresponding alkylidene species."

The document does not provide sufficient information to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of a specific molybdenum-based complex, its surface grafting, and its use in olefin metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization. There is no information provided on silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document also does not discuss mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

There are no relevant quotes provided for comparison and contrast of the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The literature focuses on the preparation and characterization of specific complexes and catalysts, including those related to olefin metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization, rather than comparing zirconium hydrides and thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation.
