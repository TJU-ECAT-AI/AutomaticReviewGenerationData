"Both lutetium-alkyl and -hydride derivatives can activate sp2 C-H bonds in both intra- and inter-molecular reactions and even activate the sp3 bonds of SiMe."
"A more important non-degenerate intermolecular C-H activation between the hydride (2) and benzene occurs..."
"Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and formation of (3) plus H, is disfavoured thermodynamically."
"Methyl complex (1) does react directly with benzene but more slowly than the hydride (2)."
"A slower reaction of the phenyl group of (3) with hydride (2) (1 : 1 in hexane, 25 "C) gives the interesting p-metallated complex (4)."
"Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H, or CH,"
"Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH, or H2 respectively."

The document discusses the facile C-H activation by lutetium-alkyl and lutetium-hydride complexes. These complexes can activate both sp2 and sp3 C-H bonds through intra- and inter-molecular reactions. Notably, the hydride derivatives exhibit faster activation rates compared to alkyl derivatives. The activation process often leads to the formation of stable metallated products, such as complexes (3), (4), (6), and (7), resulting from reactions with benzene, pyridine, ylide complexes, and tetramethylsilane, respectively. The document highlights the selective nature of these reactions, yielding high yields of single products. Additionally, the coordination of Lewis bases to the hydride can lead to further activation of the ligand, demonstrating the versatile reactivity of these complexes.

文献讨论了镧系元素-烷基和镧系元素-氢化物复合物的简单C-H活化。这些复合物可以激活sp2和sp3 C-H键，通过内分子和外分子反应。值得注意的是，氢化物衍生物的激活速率比烷基衍生物快。激活过程往往导致稳定金属化产品的形成，如（3）、（4）、（6）和（7），分别由苯、吡啶、ylide复合物和四甲基硅烷反应产生。文献强调了这些反应的选择性，高产率单个产物的产生。此外，对氢化物的配位可以导致进一步的活性化，显示出这些复合物的多用途活性。
