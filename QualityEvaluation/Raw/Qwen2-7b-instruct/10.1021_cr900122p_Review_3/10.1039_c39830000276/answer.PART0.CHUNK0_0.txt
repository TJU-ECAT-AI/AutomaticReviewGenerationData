Bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)lutetium complexes Lu( 75-C5Me5)
2R
(R = Me, H) react at 20-50
"C
in hydrocarbon solvents with benzene, pyridine, the ylide CH2PPh3,and tetramethylsilane to give stable,isolatable products o f C-H activation, i.e. metallation at a carbon of the reagent with extrusion o f
R-H.

The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) [VL" -H(Nujol) 1345 cm-'11 is readily formed?' by hydrogenolysis of (1) [reaction (i), Scheme 1 ;pentane solution, 20 "C, 1 atm H,].

As shown in reaction (iii), Scheme 1, exchange with D, also occurs in pentane at 20 "C.

Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and forma- tion of (3) plus H, is disfavoured thermodynamically.

Only C2HD5
is observed when (C2D5),0 is used suggesting a direct attack of hydride on the carbon cx to oxygen,

Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H, or CH,.

Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH, or
H2
(respectively) at 20 "C in toluene or pentane to give the 5-membered metallacycle, (7) (Scheme 2).

Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 "C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (I equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield ['H n.m.r. of (8) (CeD,,) 6 -0.39 (s, 2H, Lu-CH,), -0.03 (s, 9H, SiMe,), 1.98 (s, 30H, C,Me5); 13C n.m.r. (C&) 6 4.8 (SiMe,), 11.5 (C5Me5),
22.96
(Lu-CH,), and 118.54 p.p.m. (C5Me,)].

For R = H rather than CH3,reaction (viii) is readily reversible and the hydride (2) is thus a catalyst for the H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D, or COD6.

In conclusion, the reactions described demonstrate the following important points. C-H activation is a general phenomenon for both lanthanide alkyls and lanthanide hydrides. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable,show a remarkable level of reactivity; however, this reactivity can be quite selective giving high yields of a single product.

Finally, the products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves and not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.

The document discusses the synthesis, structure, and catalytic properties of lutetium hydrides and alkyls in C-H bond activation reactions. These reactions involve the activation of C-H bonds in various organic compounds, leading to metallation reactions with the production of hydrogen or other byproducts. The hydride species (2) is particularly noted for its ability to undergo hydrogenolysis and H/D exchange, facilitating reactions with a variety of substrates. The reactions demonstrate high selectivity and yield of single products, highlighting the unique reactivity of lutetium complexes in C-H activation. These findings suggest the potential utility of lutetium hydrides and alkyls as catalysts in organic synthesis.
