"bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)lutetium complexes Lu( 75-C5Me5)
2R
(R = Me, H) react at 20-50 °C in hydrocarbon solvents with benzene, pyridine, the ylide CH2PPh3, and tetramethylsilane to give stable, isolatable products of C-H activation, i.e., metallation at a carbon of the reagent with extrusion of R-H."

"The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) [VL" -H(Nujol) 1345 cm-'1 is readily formed by hydrogenolysis of (1) [reaction (i), Scheme 1 ;pentane solution, 20 °C, 1 atm H,]."

"As shown in reaction (ii), Scheme 1, exchange with D also occurs in pentane at 20 °C forming the deuteride, Lu(q5-CSMe5),D [vLu-D(NujoI) 975 cm-l]."

"A more important non-degenerate intermolecular C-H activation between the hydride (2) and benzene occurs wherein hydrogen is liberated and the phenyl complex (3) is formed."

"Co-ordination of Lewis bases to the hydride (2) inevitably results in further activation of the ligand [reactions (v), (vi), and (vii), Schemes I and 2]."

"Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and formation of (3) plus H is disfavoured thermodynamically."

"Complex (4) is the only doubly metallated isomer formed, presumably for steric reasons."

"Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H or CH."

"Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH or H2 respectively at 20 °C in toluene or pentane to give the 5-membered metallacycle, (7)."

"Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (I equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield."

"In conclusion, the reactions described demonstrate the following important points. C-H activation is a general phenomenon for both lanthanide alkyls and lanthanide hydrides. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable, show a remarkable level of reactivity; however, this reactivity can be quite selective giving high yields of a single product."

The document describes the synthesis and properties of lutetium-based complexes capable of activating C-H bonds in various reactions. These include activation of both sp2 and sp3 bonds, activation of silyl-methyl C-H groups, and the ability to act as catalysts in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The reactions proceed under mild conditions and involve mechanisms such as hydrogenolysis, metalla-tion, and coordination chemistry. The complexes show high reactivity and selectivity, leading to the formation of stable products. The document also highlights the stability and isolatability of the lutetium complexes, which contrasts with the more transient nature of the reactions they participate in.
