As shown in reaction (iii), Scheme 1, exchange with D, also occurs in pentane at 20 "C.

Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and forma- tion of (3) plus H, is disfavoured thermodynamically.

Only C2HD5
is observed when (C2D5),0 is used suggesting a direct attack of hydride on the carbon cx to oxygen,

Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H, or CH,.

Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH, or
H2
(respectively) at 20 "C in toluene or pentane to give the 5-membered metallacycle, (7) (Scheme 2).

Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 "C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (I equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield ['H n.m.r. of (8) (CeD,,) 6 -0.39 (s, 2H, Lu-CH,), -0.03 (s, 9H, SiMe,), 1.98 (s, 30H, C,Me5); 13C n.m.r.

For R = H rather than CH3,reaction (viii) is readily reversible and the hydride (2) is thus a catalyst for the H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D, or COD6.

In conclusion, the reactions described demonstrate the following important points. C-H activation is a general phenomenon for both lanthanide alkyls and lanthanide hydrides. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable,show a remarkable level of reactivity; however, this reactivity can be quite selective giving high yields of a single product.

Finally, the products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves and not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.

Answer: The literature describes the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of lutetium-based complexes in C-H bond activation reactions. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable, show a remarkable level of reactivity. The hydride (2) is readily formed by hydrogenolysis of (1). The activation of sp2 and sp3 C-H bonds occurs through both intra- and intermolecular reactions. The formation of products is thermodynamically disfavored, but can be forced by specific methods. Complex (4) is the only doubly metallated isomer formed due to steric reasons. Coordination of Lewis bases leads to further activation of the ligand. Pyridine coordination results in initial adduct formation followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine. Addition of CH2PPh3 leads to the formation of metallacycles. The hydride (2) acts as a catalyst for H/D exchange with tetramethylsilane. There are precedents for intramolecular activation of silyl-methyl C-H groups in uranium chemistry, and intermolecular activation of tetramethylsilane is common. The products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves, often not easily prepared by other routes.
