R-H.
I report here that lutetium-alkyl and -hydride derivatives can activate sp2 C-H bonds in both intra- and inter-molecular reactions and even activate the sp3 bonds of SiMe,. That these reactions occur under mild conditions with hydrocarbons of very low acidity is extraordinary for stable, isolatable com- plexes.
The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) [VL" -H(Nujol) 1345 cm-'1 is readily formed?' by hydrogenolysis of (1) [reaction (i), Scheme 1 ;pentane solution, 20 "C, 1 atm H,]. This hydride rapidly undergoes H/D exchange when dissolved in deuteri- ated arenes [benzene or toluene, reaction (ii)] at 20 "C forming the deuteride, Lu(q5-CSMe5),D [vLu-D(NujoI) 975 cm-l]. As shown in reaction (ii), Scheme 1, exchange with D, also occurs in pentane at 20 "C.

(phenyl C-Lu)]. Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and forma- tion of (3) plus H, is disfavoured thermodynamically. The reaction can be forced by purging H2 from the solution or by coupling reactions (i) and (ii). Thus, a benzene solution of (1) and (2) (10: I )  in a closed vessel is converted completely into (3) over several hours via coupled hydrogenolysis and metalla- tion. [Methyl complex (1) does react directly with benzene but more slowly than the hydride (2).] A slower reaction of the phenyl group of (3) with hydride (2) (1 : 1 in hexane, 25 "C) gives the interesting p-metallated complex (4) [IH n.m.r. of (4) (C,D,,) 6 1.85 (s, 30H, C,Me,) and 6.60(s, 4H, aryl); 13C n.m.r.

metallated isomer formed, presumably for steric reasons.
Co-ordination of Lewis bases to the hydride (2) inevitably results in further activation of the ligand [reactions (v), (vi),and (vii), Schemes I and 21. The diethyl ether adduct of (2),2 stable below -30 "C, extrudes ethane on warming to give Lu(T-CM,),OE,(5) [IH n.m.r. of (5) (CeDG) 6 1.42 (t, JHH

277 Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H, or CH,. The structure of the product (6) (from X-ray crystallo- graphy3) shows the o-metallated pyridine ring to lie in the plane between the two q5-C5Me,rings, with both C and N co- ordinated to the Lu atom ['H n.m.r. of (6) (C,D,,) 8 1.75 (s, 30H, C5Me5),

133.81 (Cc,Cd), 145.3 (Ca), and 234.26 p.p.m. (Ce)]. The
kinetics of formation of (6) are first order in (1)apyridine adduct but show virtually no dependence on the excess of pyridine, suggesting an intramolecular reaction. Interestingly a similar o-metallation reported for Ti(C5H5)2R complexes only occurs with 2-substituted pyridines, not with pyridine itelf.
Further examples of intramolecular aryl C-H activation,but now at the &position, are observed with ylide complexes.
Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH, or

Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 "C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (I equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield ['H n.m.r. of (8) (CeD,,) 6 -0.39 (s, 2H, Lu-CH,), -0.03 (s, 9H, SiMe,), 1.98 (s, 30H, C,Me5); 13C n.m.r. (C&) 6 4.8 (SiMe,), 11.5 (C5Me5),
22.96
(Lu-CH,), and 118.54 p.p.m. (C5Me,)]. For R = H rather than CH3,reaction (viii) is readily reversible and the hydride (2) is thus a catalyst for the H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D, or COD6.
Precedents for intramole- cular activation of silyl-methyl C-H groups exist in uranium chemist-y.$ Other examples of such ready intermolecular activation of tetramethylsilane are  n c o m m o n .  * Organo- lanthanide complexes containing the CH,SiMe3 ligand have been prepared,gp10 however, by metathetical routes.
In conclusion, the reactions described demonstrate the following important points. C-H activation is a general phenomenon for both lanthanide alkyls and lanthanide hydrides. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable,show a remarkable level of reactivity; however, this reactivity can be quite selective giving high yields of a single product.
Finally, the products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves and not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.
