in hydrocarbon solvents with benzene, pyridine, the ylide CH2PPh3, and tetramethylsilane to give stable, isolatable products of C-H activation, i.e. metallation at a carbon of the reagent with extrusion of
R-H.

The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) [VL" -H(Nujol) 1345 cm-'11 is readily formed?' by hydrogenolysis of (1) [reaction (i), Scheme 1; pentane solution, 20 "C, 1 atm H,]. This hydride rapidly undergoes H/D exchange when dissolved in deuterated arenes [benzene or toluene, reaction (ii)] at 20 "C forming the deuteride, Lu(q5-CSMe5),D [vLu-D(NujoI) 975 cm-l].

As shown in reaction (ii), Scheme 1, exchange with D, also occurs in pentane at 20 "C.

Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and formation of (3) plus H, is disfavoured thermodynamically.

Co-ordination of Lewis bases to the hydride (2) inevitably results in further activation of the ligand [reactions (v), (vi),and (vii), Schemes I and 21. The diethyl ether adduct of (2),2 stable below -30 "C, extrudes ethane on warming to give Lu(T-CM,),OE,(5) [IH n.m.r. of (5) (CeDG) 6 1.42 (t, JHH

277 Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H, or CH,.

Only C2HD5
is observed when (C2D5),0 is used suggesting a direct attack of hydride on the carbon cx to oxygen, and not a possible mechanism involving initial metallation at the P-carbon atom,

Further examples of intramolecular aryl C-H activation, but now at the &position, are observed with ylide complexes.
Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH, or

Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 "C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (I equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield ['H n.m.r. of (8) (CeD,,) 6 -0.39 (s, 2H, Lu-CH,), -0.03 (s, 9H, SiMe,), 1.98 (s, 30H, C,Me5); 13C n.m.r. (C&) 6 4.8 (SiMe,), 11.5 (C5Me5),
22.96
(Lu-CH,), and 118.54 p.p.m. (C5Me,)].

For R = H rather than CH3, reaction (viii) is readily reversible and the hydride (2) is thus a catalyst for the H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D, or COD6.

In conclusion, the reactions described demonstrate the following important points. C-H activation is a general phenomenon for both lanthanide alkyls and lanthanide hydrides. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable, show a remarkable level of reactivity; however, this reactivity can be quite selective giving high yields of a single product.

Finally, the products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves and not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.

I thank R. M. Swiatek for technical assistance and G. W. Parshall for his comments.
