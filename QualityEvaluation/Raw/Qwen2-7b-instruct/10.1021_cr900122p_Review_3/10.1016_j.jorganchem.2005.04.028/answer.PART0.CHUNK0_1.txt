[1] "While the material prepared in C6H6, 1=SiO2-700C6H6,is highly active in the metathesis of propene (TOF(5 min) = 0.89 s1 with equilibrium reached within 25 min),1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 is much less active (TOF(5 min) = 0.001 s1), and [1/SiO2-(700)]THF is completely inactive (Table 2)."
[2] "Moreover, when 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 was contacted with propene a second time after evacuation of the gas phase (1 h, 30 C, 1.34 Pa), the initial rate slightly increases (0.13 s1), which is consistent with a displacement of CH2Cl2 as the first loading of propene was evacuated."
[3] "The material 1=SiO2-700C6H6 also catalyses the metathesis of liquid olefins such as 1-octene, for which 1300 equiv. are equilibrated in only 1 h, which is similar to what is usually observed for homogenous Mo-based catalysts [44,45], and much lower than those observed with the best Ru-catalysts [28]."
[4] "Moreover, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (tBuCH@CH3) and trans 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene (tBuCH@CHMe) are formed in a 2.5:1 ratio, albeit only in small amounts,i.e., 0.15 equiv./Mo. 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butene is the major cross-metathesis product, as observed for homogeneous catalysts and (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) [38,43], because the favoured pathway involves the metallacyclobutane intermediate for which [1,2]-interac- tions are avoided and [1,3]-interactions are minimised (Scheme 3) [46]."
[5] "The material 1=SiO2-700C6H6 also catalyses the metathesis of liquid olefins such as 1-octene, for which 1300 equiv. are equilibrated in only 1 h, which is similar to what is usually observed for homogenous Mo-based catalysts [44,45], and much lower than those observed with the best Ru-catalysts [28]."
[6] "For comparison, 3 h 30 are necessary to obtain an equilibrated mixture for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CH- tBu)(CH2tBu) under the same experimental conditions,while (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates before reaching 25 TON."
[7] "In trying to trap this reactive intermediate complex, 3m was heated in the presence of trimethylphosphine, and it generated (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(P(CH3)3)2 (4m) as a 10:1 mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo."
[8] "Moreover, 3m is stable up to 60 C in C6D6 solution for weeks, and it slowly decomposes at 110 C over several hours. Furthermore, when 3m is heated at a temperature as high as 80 C in the presence of 1-octene, the NMR spectrum is unaltered, and no olefin metathesis takes place. It is necessary to carry out this reaction at 110 C to observe a quantitative transformation of 1-octene (12 equiv.) into ethylene and 7-tetradecene along with the decomposition of 3m into a complex reaction mixture."

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are highly active in propene metathesis, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides show much lower activity. Contacting alumina-supported thorium hydrides with propene again after evacuation of the gas phase leads to a slight increase in the initial rate, indicating a displacement of the first loading of propene.
2. Liquid olefins like 1-octene can be efficiently metathesized using silica-supported zirconium hydrides, with equilibrium reached in a shorter time compared to homogeneous molybdenum-based catalysts and the best ruthenium catalysts.
3. The major cross-metathesis product is 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, which forms in a 2.5:1 ratio with trans 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene, showing a pathway that avoids [1,2]-interactions and minimizes [1,3]-interactions.
4. When 3m is heated in the presence of trimethylphosphine, it generates a complex mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers, with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo.
5. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides can efficiently catalyze the metathesis of liquid olefins like 1-octene, achieving equilibrium in a short time frame, comparable to homogenous molybdenum-based catalysts but faster than the best ruthenium catalysts.
6. Under the same experimental conditions, (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) requires significantly longer time to reach equilibrium, while (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates prematurely.
7. Heating 3m in the presence of trimethylphosphine results in the generation of a complex mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers, with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo.
8. 3m remains stable up to 60°C, slowly decomposing at 110°C. Heating 3m at 80°C in the presence of 1-octene does not induce metathesis, but at 110°C, it transforms 1-octene into ethylene and 7-tetradecene, along with the decomposition of 3m into a complex reaction mixture.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢在丙烯的均裂反应中表现出高活性，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢活性较低。在氧化铝支持的钍化氢中再次接触丙烯并排出气体后，初始速率略有增加，表明首次加载的丙烯被置换。
2. 对于如辛烯这样的液态烯烃，硅酸盐支持的锆化氢可以高效催化，与同质钼基催化剂相比，达到平衡所需的时间较短，但比最好的钌催化剂快。
3. 主要的交叉均裂产物是3,3-二甲基-1-丁烯，其与顺式4,4-二甲基-2-戊烯的比率约为2.5:1，显示避免[1,2]-相互作用并最小化[1,3]-相互作用的途径。
4. 当3m在三甲基膦存在下加热时，它生成了一种包含其顺式和反式碳烯旋转异构体的复杂混合物，并释放出2个tBuCH3/Mo。
5. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢可以高效催化液态烯烃如辛烯的均裂，达到平衡所需的时间与同质钼基催化剂相似，但比最好的钌催化剂快。
6. 在相同的实验条件下，(SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)需要更长的时间才能达到平衡，而(SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2在达到25吨之前就失活。
7. 加热3m在三甲基膦的存在下导致生成一种包含其顺式和反式碳烯旋转异构体的复杂混合物，并释放出2个tBuCH3/Mo。
8. 3m在60°C稳定，逐渐分解在110°C。在80°C加热3m在1-octene的存在下不会诱导均裂，但在110°C下，它将1-octene转化为乙烯和7-十四烯，同时3m分解成复杂的反应混合物。
