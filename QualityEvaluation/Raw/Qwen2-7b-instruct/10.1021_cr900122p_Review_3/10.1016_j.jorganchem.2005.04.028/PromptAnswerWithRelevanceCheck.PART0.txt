[1] "While the material prepared in C6H6, 1=SiO2-700C6H6,is highly active in the metathesis of propene (TOF(5 min) = 0.89 s1 with equilibrium reached within 25 min),1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 is much less active (TOF(5 min) = 0.001 s1), and [1/SiO2-(700)]THF is com- pletely inactive (Table 2)."
[2] "Moreover, when 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 was contacted with propene a second time after evacuation of the gas phase (1 h, 30 C, 1.34 Pa), the initial rate slightly increases (0.13 s1), which is consistent with a displace- ment of CH2Cl2 as the first loading of propene was evacuated."
[3] "The initial rate of 1=SiO2-700C6H6 is comparable to those reported for (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 and (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) (Table 3) [36,38,43]. Moreover, the rate is much greater than those observed for Mo-based heterogeneous catalysts, MoO3/ S (S = SiO2, Al2O3), which typically work under much higher temperature conditions, ca. 150250 C. It is however still lower than those reported for comparable molybdenum homogeneous catalysts [44,45]."
[4] "The material 1=SiO2-700C6H6 also catalyses the metathesis of liquid olefins such as 1-octene, for which 1300 equiv. are equilibrated in only 1 h, which is similar to what is usually observed for homogenous Mo-based catalysts [44,45], and much lower than those observed with the best Ru-catalysts [28]."
[5] "For comparison, 3 h 30 are necessary to obtain an equil- ibrated mixture for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) under the same experimental conditions,while (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates be- fore reaching 25 TON."
[6] "Finally, 700 productive TONs are reached in 24 h when 2000 equiv. of ethyl oleate are used, which is a little lower than what was found for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)."
[7] "The complex 3m has a bipyramidal trigonal geometry with the three alkyl substituents in the basal positions;the N and the O atoms occupying the two apical posi- tions."
[8] "Moreover,performing an
HSQC
experiment showed that the signals at 13.67 and 14.23 displayed,respectively, a correlation with signals in the 13C dimen- sion at
313.0
(1JCH = 110 Hz) and

1. The silica-supported zirconium hydride prepared in C6H6 (1=SiO2-700C6H6) is highly active in propene metathesis, achieving a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.89 s−1, compared to the much lower TOF of 0.001 s−1 for the silica-supported zirconium hydride prepared in CH2Cl2 (1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2). The material prepared in THF ([1/SiO2-(700)]THF) is completely inactive in propene metathesis.

2. When 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 is contacted with propene a second time after removing the gas phase, the initial rate increases to 0.13 s−1, indicating the displacement of CH2Cl2 from the first loading of propene.

3. The initial rate of 1=SiO2-700C6H6 is comparable to those reported for other zirconium hydrides and thorium hydrides. It is faster than many molybdenum-based heterogeneous catalysts, but slower than certain molybdenum-based homogeneous catalysts.

4. 1=SiO2-700C6H6 also efficiently catalyzes the metathesis of liquid olefins like 1-octene, achieving equilibrium in just 1 hour, which is similar to molybdenum-based homogeneous catalysts but faster than the best ruthenium catalysts.

5. The reaction time required to reach equilibrium for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) under the same conditions is longer (3 h 30) than for 1=SiO2-700C6H6, and (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates before reaching 25 turnovers.

6. By using 2000 equivalents of ethyl oleate, 700 productive turnovers are achieved in 24 hours with 1=SiO2-700C6H6, which is slightly lower than the turnovers achieved with (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu).

7. The complex 3m has a bipyramidal trigonal geometry, with the three alkyl substituents positioned at the base and the nitrogen and oxygen atoms at the apices.

8. Performing a HSQC experiment revealed correlations between signals at 13.67 and 14.23 ppm in the 1H dimension and signals at 313.0 ppm (1JCH = 110 Hz) and 321.0 ppm (1JCH = 136 Hz) in the 13C dimension, indicating the presence of two distinct alkylidene rotamers in the complex.

1.X在C6H6中制备的二氧化硅支持锆氢化物在丙烯的位移反应中非常活跃（每分钟周转数为0.89 s−1，平衡在25分钟内达到），相比之下，X在CH2Cl2中制备的二氧化硅支持锆氢化物的初始速率仅为0.001 s−1。X在THF中制备的材料（[1/SiO2-(700)]THF）完全不活性丙烯的位移反应。

2. 当对1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2进行第二次接触丙烯并在去除气体相后移除时，初始速率增加到0.13 s−1，表明首次加载丙烯后CH2Cl2的置换。

3. 1=SiO2-700C6H6的初始速率与报道的其他锆氢化物和钍氢化物相当。它比许多钼基异质催化剂更快，但比某些钼基均相催化剂慢。

4. 在相同的实验条件下，1=SiO2-700C6H6能够高效催化液态烯烃如1-辛烯的位移反应，仅需1小时即可达到平衡，这类似于钼基均相催化剂，但比最佳铑催化剂更快。

5. 对于（SiO）Re（CtBu）（@CHtBu）（CH2tBu），在相同条件下达到平衡所需的时间更长（3小时30分钟），而（SiO）Mo（CtBu）（CH2tBu）2在达到25次周转之前已失效。

6. 使用2000等当量的乙基醋酸酯，1=SiO2-700C6H6在24小时内实现了700次有效的周转，这略低于（SiO）Re（CtBu）（@CHtBu）（CH2tBu）的周转。

7. 复合物3m具有双锥三角几何结构，三个烷基取代基位于底部，氮和氧原子位于顶部。

8. 执行HSQC实验揭示了1H维中信号在13.67和14.23 ppm之间的相关性以及13C维中信号在313.0 ppm（1JCH = 110 Hz）和321.0 ppm（1JCH = 136 Hz）之间的相关性，表明复合物中存在两种不同的烷基二烯体异构体。

[7] "In trying to trap this reactive intermediate complex, 3m was heated in the presence of trimethylphosphine, and it generated (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(P(CH3)3)2 (4m) as a 10:1 mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo."
[8] "Moreover, 3m is stable up to 60 C in C6D6 solution for weeks, and it slowly decomposes at 110 C over several hours. Furthermore, when 3m is heated at a temperature as high as 80 C in the presence of 1-octene, the NMR spectrum is unaltered, and no olefin metathesis takes place. It is necessary to carry out this reaction at 110 C to observe a quantitative transformation of 1-octene (12 equiv.) into ethylene and 7-tetradecene along with the decomposition of 3m into a complex reaction mixture."

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are highly active in propene metathesis, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides show much lower activity. Contacting alumina-supported thorium hydrides with propene again after evacuation of the gas phase leads to a slight increase in the initial rate, indicating a displacement of the first loading of propene.
2. Liquid olefins like 1-octene can be efficiently metathesized using silica-supported zirconium hydrides, with equilibrium reached in a shorter time compared to homogeneous molybdenum-based catalysts and the best ruthenium catalysts.
3. The major cross-metathesis product is 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, which forms in a 2.5:1 ratio with trans 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene, showing a pathway that avoids [1,2]-interactions and minimizes [1,3]-interactions.
4. When 3m is heated in the presence of trimethylphosphine, it generates a complex mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers, with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo.
5. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides can efficiently catalyze the metathesis of liquid olefins like 1-octene, achieving equilibrium in a short time frame, comparable to homogenous molybdenum-based catalysts but faster than the best ruthenium catalysts.
6. Under the same experimental conditions, (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) requires significantly longer time to reach equilibrium, while (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates prematurely.
7. Heating 3m in the presence of trimethylphosphine results in the generation of a complex mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers, with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo.
8. 3m remains stable up to 60°C, slowly decomposing at 110°C. Heating 3m at 80°C in the presence of 1-octene does not induce metathesis, but at 110°C, it transforms 1-octene into ethylene and 7-tetradecene, along with the decomposition of 3m into a complex reaction mixture.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢在丙烯的均裂反应中表现出高活性，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢活性较低。在氧化铝支持的钍化氢中再次接触丙烯并排出气体后，初始速率略有增加，表明首次加载的丙烯被置换。
2. 对于如辛烯这样的液态烯烃，硅酸盐支持的锆化氢可以高效催化，与同质钼基催化剂相比，达到平衡所需的时间较短，但比最好的钌催化剂快。
3. 主要的交叉均裂产物是3,3-二甲基-1-丁烯，其与顺式4,4-二甲基-2-戊烯的比率约为2.5:1，显示避免[1,2]-相互作用并最小化[1,3]-相互作用的途径。
4. 当3m在三甲基膦存在下加热时，它生成了一种包含其顺式和反式碳烯旋转异构体的复杂混合物，并释放出2个tBuCH3/Mo。
5. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢可以高效催化液态烯烃如辛烯的均裂，达到平衡所需的时间与同质钼基催化剂相似，但比最好的钌催化剂快。
6. 在相同的实验条件下，(SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)需要更长的时间才能达到平衡，而(SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2在达到25吨之前就失活。
7. 加热3m在三甲基膦的存在下导致生成一种包含其顺式和反式碳烯旋转异构体的复杂混合物，并释放出2个tBuCH3/Mo。
8. 3m在60°C稳定，逐渐分解在110°C。在80°C加热3m在1-octene的存在下不会诱导均裂，但在110°C下，它将1-octene转化为乙烯和7-十四烯，同时3m分解成复杂的反应混合物。

[1] "The reaction of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and SiO2-(700) generates (SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) (2) when performed in C6H6 1=SiO2-700C6H6. The grafting occurs presumably by protonation of the nitrido ligand to the form an intermediate (SiO)Mo(@NH)- (CH2tBu)3 (3), a pentacoordinated complex, which decomposes into 2 and 2,2-dimethylpropane."
[2] "While 1=SiO2-700C6H6 is highly active in olefin metathesis, the preparation of [1/SiO2-(700)] in THF or CH2Cl2 yields inactive or poorly active catalysts."
[3] "The preparation of this material can be easily performed on 1 g scales, but it can be readily scale-up to 10100 g scale, replacing C6H6 by toluene since 1 and SiO2-(700) are readily accessible."
[4] "In contrast, when Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 reacts with a molecular silanol derivative, which we and others have typically used to model the surface of SiO2-(700), it yields a very stable complex,(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(@ NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3m), which does not spontaneously generate 2,2-dimethylpropane and an alkylidene complex in contrast to the surface complex."
[5] "Moreover, 3m does not catalyse olefin metathesis at room temperature as it does not already contain the initiating carbene ligand, and it is necessary to heat up the reaction mixture to 110 C to obtain some catalytic activity."
[6] "In trying to trap this reactive intermediate complex, 3m was heated in the presence of trimethylphosphine, and it generated (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(P(CH3)3)2 (4m) as a 10:1 mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo."

1. The reaction of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and partially dehydroxylated silica (SiO2-(700)) in toluene leads to the formation of (SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) (2), which is highly active in olefin metathesis. This process involves the protonation of the nitrido ligand, forming an intermediate (SiO)Mo(@NH)- (CH2tBu)3 (3), which decomposes into 2 and 2,2-dimethylpropane.

2. Preparing silica-supported catalysts in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or chloroform (CH2Cl2) results in inactive or poorly active catalysts compared to the toluene-solubilized version.

3. Large-scale preparation of the catalyst can be achieved, extending from 1 gram to 100 grams, by replacing toluene with a suitable solvent considering the availability of both Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and SiO2-(700).

4. Reacting Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 with a molecular silanol derivative (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOH yields a stable complex (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(@ NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3m), which lacks spontaneous 2,2-dimethylpropane and alkylidene complex generation, unlike its surface counterpart.

5. Complex 3m does not exhibit catalytic activity at room temperature unless heated to 110°C, which indicates the absence of the initiating carbene ligand.

6. Treating complex 3m with trimethylphosphine under heat generates a mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers (4m), releasing 2 tBuCH3/Mo.

1. 将Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3和部分脱羟基的硅酸盐（SiO2-(700)）在二甲苯中反应，生成（SiO）Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)（2），这使其在烯烃环化反应中非常活跃。此过程涉及氮化物配体的质子化，形成中间体（SiO）Mo(@NH)-（CH2tBu）3（3），它分解为2和2,2-二甲基丙烷。

2. 在四氢呋喃（THF）或氯仿（CH2Cl2）中制备硅酸盐支持催化剂导致活性较低或无活性，与在二甲苯溶剂中的版本相比。

3. 可以实现从1克到100克的大规模制备催化剂，通过替换二甲苯为适合的溶剂，考虑到Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3和SiO2-(700)的可用性。

4. 将Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3与分子型硅醇衍生物（c-C5H9）7Si7O12SiOH反应产生稳定复合物（c-C5H9）7Si7O12SiOMo(@ NH)(CH2tBu)3（3m），它缺乏自发生成2,2-二甲基丙烷和烷基亚胺复合物，与它的表面等价物不同。

5. 复合物3m在室温下不表现出催化活性，除非加热至110°C，这表明缺失起始碳烯配体。

6. 在热处理下将复合物3m与三甲基膦处理，产生其顺式和反式碳烯异构体（4m）的混合物，并释放出2 tBuCH3/Mo。
