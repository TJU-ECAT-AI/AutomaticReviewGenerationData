[1] "The reaction of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and SiO2-(700) generates (SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) (2) when performed in C6H6 1=SiO2-700C6H6. The grafting occurs presumably by protonation of the nitrido ligand to the form an intermediate (SiO)Mo(@NH)- (CH2tBu)3 (3), a pentacoordinated complex, which decomposes into 2 and 2,2-dimethylpropane."
[2] "While 1=SiO2-700C6H6 is highly active in olefin metathesis, the preparation of [1/SiO2-(700)] in THF or CH2Cl2 yields inactive or poorly active catalysts."
[3] "The preparation of this material can be easily performed on 1 g scales, but it can be readily scale-up to 10100 g scale, replacing C6H6 by toluene since 1 and SiO2-(700) are readily accessible."
[4] "In contrast, when Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 reacts with a molecular silanol derivative, which we and others have typically used to model the surface of SiO2-(700), it yields a very stable complex,(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(@ NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3m), which does not spontaneously generate 2,2-dimethylpropane and an alkylidene complex in contrast to the surface complex."
[5] "Moreover, 3m does not catalyse olefin metathesis at room temperature as it does not already contain the initiating carbene ligand, and it is necessary to heat up the reaction mixture to 110 C to obtain some catalytic activity."
[6] "In trying to trap this reactive intermediate complex, 3m was heated in the presence of trimethylphosphine, and it generated (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(P(CH3)3)2 (4m) as a 10:1 mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo."

1. The reaction of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and partially dehydroxylated silica (SiO2-(700)) in toluene leads to the formation of (SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) (2), which is highly active in olefin metathesis. This process involves the protonation of the nitrido ligand, forming an intermediate (SiO)Mo(@NH)- (CH2tBu)3 (3), which decomposes into 2 and 2,2-dimethylpropane.

2. Preparing silica-supported catalysts in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or chloroform (CH2Cl2) results in inactive or poorly active catalysts compared to the toluene-solubilized version.

3. Large-scale preparation of the catalyst can be achieved, extending from 1 gram to 100 grams, by replacing toluene with a suitable solvent considering the availability of both Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and SiO2-(700).

4. Reacting Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 with a molecular silanol derivative (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOH yields a stable complex (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(@ NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3m), which lacks spontaneous 2,2-dimethylpropane and alkylidene complex generation, unlike its surface counterpart.

5. Complex 3m does not exhibit catalytic activity at room temperature unless heated to 110°C, which indicates the absence of the initiating carbene ligand.

6. Treating complex 3m with trimethylphosphine under heat generates a mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers (4m), releasing 2 tBuCH3/Mo.

1. 将Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3和部分脱羟基的硅酸盐（SiO2-(700)）在二甲苯中反应，生成（SiO）Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)（2），这使其在烯烃环化反应中非常活跃。此过程涉及氮化物配体的质子化，形成中间体（SiO）Mo(@NH)-（CH2tBu）3（3），它分解为2和2,2-二甲基丙烷。

2. 在四氢呋喃（THF）或氯仿（CH2Cl2）中制备硅酸盐支持催化剂导致活性较低或无活性，与在二甲苯溶剂中的版本相比。

3. 可以实现从1克到100克的大规模制备催化剂，通过替换二甲苯为适合的溶剂，考虑到Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3和SiO2-(700)的可用性。

4. 将Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3与分子型硅醇衍生物（c-C5H9）7Si7O12SiOH反应产生稳定复合物（c-C5H9）7Si7O12SiOMo(@ NH)(CH2tBu)3（3m），它缺乏自发生成2,2-二甲基丙烷和烷基亚胺复合物，与它的表面等价物不同。

5. 复合物3m在室温下不表现出催化活性，除非加热至110°C，这表明缺失起始碳烯配体。

6. 在热处理下将复合物3m与三甲基膦处理，产生其顺式和反式碳烯异构体（4m）的混合物，并释放出2 tBuCH3/Mo。
