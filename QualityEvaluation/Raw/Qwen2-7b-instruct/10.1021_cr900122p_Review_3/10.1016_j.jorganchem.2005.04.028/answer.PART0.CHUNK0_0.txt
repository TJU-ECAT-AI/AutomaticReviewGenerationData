[1] "While the material prepared in C6H6, 1=SiO2-700C6H6,is highly active in the metathesis of propene (TOF(5 min) = 0.89 s1 with equilibrium reached within 25 min),1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 is much less active (TOF(5 min) = 0.001 s1), and [1/SiO2-(700)]THF is com- pletely inactive (Table 2)."
[2] "Moreover, when 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 was contacted with propene a second time after evacuation of the gas phase (1 h, 30 C, 1.34 Pa), the initial rate slightly increases (0.13 s1), which is consistent with a displace- ment of CH2Cl2 as the first loading of propene was evacuated."
[3] "The initial rate of 1=SiO2-700C6H6 is comparable to those reported for (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 and (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) (Table 3) [36,38,43]. Moreover, the rate is much greater than those observed for Mo-based heterogeneous catalysts, MoO3/ S (S = SiO2, Al2O3), which typically work under much higher temperature conditions, ca. 150250 C. It is however still lower than those reported for comparable molybdenum homogeneous catalysts [44,45]."
[4] "The material 1=SiO2-700C6H6 also catalyses the metathesis of liquid olefins such as 1-octene, for which 1300 equiv. are equilibrated in only 1 h, which is similar to what is usually observed for homogenous Mo-based catalysts [44,45], and much lower than those observed with the best Ru-catalysts [28]."
[5] "For comparison, 3 h 30 are necessary to obtain an equil- ibrated mixture for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) under the same experimental conditions,while (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates be- fore reaching 25 TON."
[6] "Finally, 700 productive TONs are reached in 24 h when 2000 equiv. of ethyl oleate are used, which is a little lower than what was found for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)."
[7] "The complex 3m has a bipyramidal trigonal geometry with the three alkyl substituents in the basal positions;the N and the O atoms occupying the two apical posi- tions."
[8] "Moreover,performing an
HSQC
experiment showed that the signals at 13.67 and 14.23 displayed,respectively, a correlation with signals in the 13C dimen- sion at
313.0
(1JCH = 110 Hz) and
321.0
(1JCH =
136 Hz) ppm as resolved doublets."

1. The silica-supported zirconium hydride prepared in C6H6 (1=SiO2-700C6H6) is highly active in propene metathesis, achieving a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.89 s−1, compared to the much lower TOF of 0.001 s−1 for the silica-supported zirconium hydride prepared in CH2Cl2 (1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2). The material prepared in THF ([1/SiO2-(700)]THF) is completely inactive in propene metathesis.

2. When 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 is contacted with propene a second time after removing the gas phase, the initial rate increases to 0.13 s−1, indicating the displacement of CH2Cl2 from the first loading of propene.

3. The initial rate of 1=SiO2-700C6H6 is comparable to those reported for other zirconium hydrides and thorium hydrides. It is faster than many molybdenum-based heterogeneous catalysts, but slower than certain molybdenum-based homogeneous catalysts.

4. 1=SiO2-700C6H6 also efficiently catalyzes the metathesis of liquid olefins like 1-octene, achieving equilibrium in just 1 hour, which is similar to molybdenum-based homogeneous catalysts but faster than the best ruthenium catalysts.

5. The reaction time required to reach equilibrium for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) under the same conditions is longer (3 h 30) than for 1=SiO2-700C6H6, and (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates before reaching 25 turnovers.

6. By using 2000 equivalents of ethyl oleate, 700 productive turnovers are achieved in 24 hours with 1=SiO2-700C6H6, which is slightly lower than the turnovers achieved with (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu).

7. The complex 3m has a bipyramidal trigonal geometry, with the three alkyl substituents positioned at the base and the nitrogen and oxygen atoms at the apices.

8. Performing a HSQC experiment revealed correlations between signals at 13.67 and 14.23 ppm in the 1H dimension and signals at 313.0 ppm (1JCH = 110 Hz) and 321.0 ppm (1JCH = 136 Hz) in the 13C dimension, indicating the presence of two distinct alkylidene rotamers in the complex.

1.X在C6H6中制备的二氧化硅支持锆氢化物在丙烯的位移反应中非常活跃（每分钟周转数为0.89 s−1，平衡在25分钟内达到），相比之下，X在CH2Cl2中制备的二氧化硅支持锆氢化物的初始速率仅为0.001 s−1。X在THF中制备的材料（[1/SiO2-(700)]THF）完全不活性丙烯的位移反应。

2. 当对1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2进行第二次接触丙烯并在去除气体相后移除时，初始速率增加到0.13 s−1，表明首次加载丙烯后CH2Cl2的置换。

3. 1=SiO2-700C6H6的初始速率与报道的其他锆氢化物和钍氢化物相当。它比许多钼基异质催化剂更快，但比某些钼基均相催化剂慢。

4. 在相同的实验条件下，1=SiO2-700C6H6能够高效催化液态烯烃如1-辛烯的位移反应，仅需1小时即可达到平衡，这类似于钼基均相催化剂，但比最佳铑催化剂更快。

5. 对于（SiO）Re（CtBu）（@CHtBu）（CH2tBu），在相同条件下达到平衡所需的时间更长（3小时30分钟），而（SiO）Mo（CtBu）（CH2tBu）2在达到25次周转之前已失效。

6. 使用2000等当量的乙基醋酸酯，1=SiO2-700C6H6在24小时内实现了700次有效的周转，这略低于（SiO）Re（CtBu）（@CHtBu）（CH2tBu）的周转。

7. 复合物3m具有双锥三角几何结构，三个烷基取代基位于底部，氮和氧原子位于顶部。

8. 执行HSQC实验揭示了1H维中信号在13.67和14.23 ppm之间的相关性以及13C维中信号在313.0 ppm（1JCH = 110 Hz）和321.0 ppm（1JCH = 136 Hz）之间的相关性，表明复合物中存在两种不同的烷基二烯体异构体。
