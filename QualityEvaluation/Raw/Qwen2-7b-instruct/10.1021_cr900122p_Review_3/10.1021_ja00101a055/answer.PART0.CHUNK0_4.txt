The study compares the reactivity of the iridium-oxygen bond in silica-supported Cp*Ir[silica](Ph)(PMe3) to understand its role in C-H bond activation reactions. It contrasts the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in processes such as H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. These processes involve mechanisms including σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Reaction rates, selectivity, and the contributions of these mechanisms are analyzed.
