The selective oxidation of paraffins involves several key aspects of catalyst design. Among these, vanadium plays a preferred role due to its ability to facilitate the selective oxidation of alkanes effectively. Its isolation within a quasi-inert matrix enhances stability, ensuring that the catalyst maintains its efficiency over multiple reactions. The stability of the product is crucial for achieving consistent results, while multifunctionality, which includes both catalytic activity and the ability to explain reaction mechanisms, is essential for optimizing catalyst performance. The type of C-H bond activation influences reaction rates and selectivity, and the balance between acidity and basicity affects the catalytic efficiency, particularly in processes like H/D exchange and alkane metathesis.
