[1] "Grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes, [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C selectively yields an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies."
[2] "However, only 30% of the surface silanols react, independently of reaction time."
[3] "DFT calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand."
[4] "This also induces a change of geometry from a distorted tetrahedron into a butterfly structure having apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands, and a lone pair occupying the position of a fifth coordination site."
[5] "Investigation of grafting reaction pathways shows that s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond of either the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, stabilized by the coordination of a silanol, is favoured; the latter being preferred because it involves a rather flat free energy profile and because the bis-alkylidene intermediate has not been experimentally observed."

This study discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported osmium complexes in comparison to alumina-supported thorium complexes for C-H bond activation reactions. The osmium complexes undergo isomerization upon grafting, changing from a bis-alkylidene structure to an alkyl alkylidyne structure. This isomerization is driven by the substitution of a strong s-donor alkyl ligand with a weaker s-donor siloxy ligand, which results in a change of geometry from a distorted tetrahedron to a butterfly structure. The s-bond metathesis pathway, favored by the coordination of silanol, explains the formation of the alkyl alkylidyne structure. The process is energetically favorable due to the stability gain of the alkyl alkylidyne structure over the bis-alkylidene structure when a strong s-donor ligand is replaced by a weaker one. This contrasts with alumina-supported thorium complexes, which do not undergo similar isomerization and structural changes upon grafting. The differences in structure and reactivity between the osmium and thorium complexes are attributed to the heterogeneity of silica surfaces, which influences the grafting process and leads to lower metal loading in osmium complexes compared to thorium complexes. Further investigation is needed to understand the role of this heterogeneity on structure and activity.

本文研究了二氧化硅支持的锇复合物和氧化铝支持的钍复合物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。锇复合物在接枝后发生异构化，从二烷基亚甲基结构转变为烷基亚甲基结构。这种异构化是由强给电子烷基配体被较弱给电子硅氧烷配体取代驱动的，导致从扭曲四面体结构到蝴蝶结构的几何变化。通过硅醇的配合，s键裂合途径解释了亚甲基结构的形成。这一过程的能量优势归因于当强给电子配体被较弱配体取代时，亚甲基结构相对于二烷基亚甲基结构的稳定性增加。这与氧化铝支持的钍复合物不同，这些复合物不会经历类似的异构化和结构变化。锇和钍复合物之间的结构和反应性的差异归因于二氧化硅表面的异质性，这影响了接枝过程并导致锇复合物中金属负载较低，而钍复合物中则较高。需要进一步研究以了解这种异质性对结构和活性的影响。
