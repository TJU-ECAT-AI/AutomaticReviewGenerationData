[1] "Grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes,[Os(=CHtBu)2-(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C selectively yields an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)-(CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies."
[2] "However, only 30% of the surface silanols react, independently of reaction time."
[3] "The grafting process corresponds to a replacement of one alkyl by a siloxy ligand along with an isomerisation of the metal fragments from a bis- alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne."
[4] "DFT calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand."
[5] "Investigation of grafting reaction pathways shows that s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond of either the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, stabilized by the coordination of a silanol, is favoured."
[6] "Note that the surface chemistry of this d2 Os complex greatly differs from what has been observed for d0 alkylidene complexes in several aspects."

The preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions is distinct. For the Os bisalkylidene complexes grafted on silica, a selective formation of an alkyl alkylidyne complex occurs. Only 30% of the surface silanols react, regardless of the reaction duration. This grafting process involves replacing one alkyl ligand with a siloxy ligand, accompanied by an isomerization of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene to an alkyl alkylidyne. DFT calculations reveal that the bis-alkylidene is energetically favored over the alkyl alkylidyne for the perhydrocarbyl complex, but the latter becomes more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand. The geometry changes from a distorted tetrahedron to a butterfly structure with apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands, and a lone pair occupying the position of a fifth coordination site. The s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond, either in the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, is favored in the grafting reaction pathway. 

In contrast, the surface chemistry of d2 Os complexes differs significantly from that of d0 alkylidene complexes. This difference is attributed to the distinct reactivity of surface silanols, possibly influenced by their local environment, such as the presence or absence of neighboring siloxane bridges. The heterogeneity of silica surfaces has implications for structure and activity, but further investigation is needed to elucidate the nature and role of this heterogeneity.

Zirconium hydrides和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备方式有所不同。对于Os二烷基烯丙基复合物在硅胶上的接枝，会形成一种烷基烷基烯丙基复合物的选择性形成。只有30%的表面硅醇发生反应，无论反应时间如何。这种接枝过程包括用一个硅氧烷基团替换一个烷基基团，并伴随着金属片段从二烷基烯丙基到烷基烷基烯丙基的异构化。DFT计算显示，对于perhydrocarbyl复合物，二烷基烯丙基是能量上更优的异构体，而当强s-供体烷基基团之一被较弱的s-供体硅氧烷基团取代时，烷基烷基烯丙基异构体变得更稳定。几何结构从扭曲的四面体变为具有硅氧烷和烷基烯丙基的蝴蝶结构，以及占据第五配位位置的孤对。在接枝反应途径中，金属烷基键的σ-键裂解受到硅醇的稳定，无论是二烷基烯丙基复合物还是吸附的烷基烷基烯丙基异构体，都是受青睐的。

相比之下，Os复合物的表面化学与d0烷基烯丙基复合物大不相同。这种差异归因于表面硅醇的反应性不同，可能受到其局部环境的影响，例如邻近的硅氧烷桥的存在与否。硅胶表面的异质性对结构和活性有影响，但需要进一步的研究来阐明这种异质性的性质及其在结构和活性中的作用。

This study discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported osmium complexes in comparison to alumina-supported thorium complexes for C-H bond activation reactions. The osmium complexes undergo isomerization upon grafting, changing from a bis-alkylidene structure to an alkyl alkylidyne structure. This isomerization is driven by the substitution of a strong s-donor alkyl ligand with a weaker s-donor siloxy ligand, which results in a change of geometry from a distorted tetrahedron to a butterfly structure. The s-bond metathesis pathway, favored by the coordination of silanol, explains the formation of the alkyl alkylidyne structure. The process is energetically favorable due to the stability gain of the alkyl alkylidyne structure over the bis-alkylidene structure when a strong s-donor ligand is replaced by a weaker one. This contrasts with alumina-supported thorium complexes, which do not undergo similar isomerization and structural changes upon grafting. The differences in structure and reactivity between the osmium and thorium complexes are attributed to the heterogeneity of silica surfaces, which influences the grafting process and leads to lower metal loading in osmium complexes compared to thorium complexes. Further investigation is needed to understand the role of this heterogeneity on structure and activity.

本文研究了二氧化硅支持的锇复合物和氧化铝支持的钍复合物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。锇复合物在接枝后发生异构化，从二烷基亚甲基结构转变为烷基亚甲基结构。这种异构化是由强给电子烷基配体被较弱给电子硅氧烷配体取代驱动的，导致从扭曲四面体结构到蝴蝶结构的几何变化。通过硅醇的配合，s键裂合途径解释了亚甲基结构的形成。这一过程的能量优势归因于当强给电子配体被较弱配体取代时，亚甲基结构相对于二烷基亚甲基结构的稳定性增加。这与氧化铝支持的钍复合物不同，这些复合物不会经历类似的异构化和结构变化。锇和钍复合物之间的结构和反应性的差异归因于二氧化硅表面的异质性，这影响了接枝过程并导致锇复合物中金属负载较低，而钍复合物中则较高。需要进一步研究以了解这种异质性对结构和活性的影响。

The study reveals that the grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes onto silica partially dehydroxylated at 700°C results in the formation of an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]. This transformation is energetically favored, with the bis-alkylidene being the preferred isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex. Replacing one alkyl ligand with a siloxy ligand not only changes the geometry from a distorted tetrahedron to a butterfly structure, but also increases the stability of the alkyl alkylidyne isomer. The process is driven by s-bond metathesis, which is favored over other mechanisms due to its lower activation energy. However, only 30% of the surface silanols participate in the reaction, suggesting that the reactivity of surface silanols may be influenced by their local environment.

研究发现，将Os二烷基金属络合物嫁接到部分脱水至700°C的硅酸盐上，可生成烷基烷基烯丙基复合物[(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]。这一转变在能量上是被优先考虑的，对于氢化碳络合物，二烷基络合物是首选异构体。用较弱的烷氧基取代一个烷基不仅改变了几何形状，从扭曲的四面体变为蝴蝶状结构，而且增加了烷基烷基烯丙基异构体的稳定性。这一过程由σ键裂解驱动，其优势在于较低的活化能。然而，只有30%的表面硅醇参与反应，这表明表面硅醇的反应性可能受到其局部环境的影响。

The preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides involves distinct mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions. For silica-supported zirconium hydrides, H/D exchange typically occurs via [1,2]-addition of the silanol to the alkylidene ligand. This process is favored over direct s-bond metathesis, as it involves a lower activation energy. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, often exhibit direct s-bond metathesis without isomerization during the grafting process. The selectivity of these reactions can be influenced by factors such as reaction rates, which are determined by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the involved reactions. In terms of chain walking, the ability of the catalyst to move along the alkane chain for metathesis reactions may vary depending on the support material and the specific conditions of the reaction. The role of hydrogenolysis in these processes can also play a significant part in determining the overall selectivity of the reactions, as it can lead to side reactions that compete with the desired C-H bond activation.

在硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物的制备中，它们在C-H键活化反应中的机制存在显著差异。对于硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物，H/D交换通常通过将硅醇添加到烷基酮基团上实现。这一过程由于其较低的活化能而被优先考虑。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物往往表现出直接的σ键互换，而无需异构化即可进行接枝过程。这些反应的选择性可以由反应速率等因素决定，这些因素由涉及反应的热力学和动力学确定。关于链行走，在这些过程中，催化剂沿烷烃链进行代谢的能力可能因支持材料和反应条件的不同而有所不同。氢解离在这些过程中也可能扮演重要角色，因为它可能导致与所需C-H键活化竞争的副反应。
