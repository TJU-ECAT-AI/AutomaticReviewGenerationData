[1] "Grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes,[Os(=CHtBu)2-(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C selectively yields an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)-(CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies."
[2] "However, only 30% of the surface silanols react, independently of reaction time."
[3] "The grafting process corresponds to a replacement of one alkyl by a siloxy ligand along with an isomerisation of the metal fragments from a bis- alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne."
[4] "DFT calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand."
[5] "Investigation of grafting reaction pathways shows that s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond of either the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, stabilized by the coordination of a silanol, is favoured."
[6] "Note that the surface chemistry of this d2 Os complex greatly differs from what has been observed for d0 alkylidene complexes in several aspects."

The preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions is distinct. For the Os bisalkylidene complexes grafted on silica, a selective formation of an alkyl alkylidyne complex occurs. Only 30% of the surface silanols react, regardless of the reaction duration. This grafting process involves replacing one alkyl ligand with a siloxy ligand, accompanied by an isomerization of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene to an alkyl alkylidyne. DFT calculations reveal that the bis-alkylidene is energetically favored over the alkyl alkylidyne for the perhydrocarbyl complex, but the latter becomes more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand. The geometry changes from a distorted tetrahedron to a butterfly structure with apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands, and a lone pair occupying the position of a fifth coordination site. The s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond, either in the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, is favored in the grafting reaction pathway. 

In contrast, the surface chemistry of d2 Os complexes differs significantly from that of d0 alkylidene complexes. This difference is attributed to the distinct reactivity of surface silanols, possibly influenced by their local environment, such as the presence or absence of neighboring siloxane bridges. The heterogeneity of silica surfaces has implications for structure and activity, but further investigation is needed to elucidate the nature and role of this heterogeneity.

Zirconium hydrides和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备方式有所不同。对于Os二烷基烯丙基复合物在硅胶上的接枝，会形成一种烷基烷基烯丙基复合物的选择性形成。只有30%的表面硅醇发生反应，无论反应时间如何。这种接枝过程包括用一个硅氧烷基团替换一个烷基基团，并伴随着金属片段从二烷基烯丙基到烷基烷基烯丙基的异构化。DFT计算显示，对于perhydrocarbyl复合物，二烷基烯丙基是能量上更优的异构体，而当强s-供体烷基基团之一被较弱的s-供体硅氧烷基团取代时，烷基烷基烯丙基异构体变得更稳定。几何结构从扭曲的四面体变为具有硅氧烷和烷基烯丙基的蝴蝶结构，以及占据第五配位位置的孤对。在接枝反应途径中，金属烷基键的σ-键裂解受到硅醇的稳定，无论是二烷基烯丙基复合物还是吸附的烷基烷基烯丙基异构体，都是受青睐的。

相比之下，Os复合物的表面化学与d0烷基烯丙基复合物大不相同。这种差异归因于表面硅醇的反应性不同，可能受到其局部环境的影响，例如邻近的硅氧烷桥的存在与否。硅胶表面的异质性对结构和活性有影响，但需要进一步的研究来阐明这种异质性的性质及其在结构和活性中的作用。
