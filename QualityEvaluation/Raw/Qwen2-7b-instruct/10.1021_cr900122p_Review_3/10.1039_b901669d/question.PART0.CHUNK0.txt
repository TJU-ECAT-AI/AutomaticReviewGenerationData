Grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes, [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C selectively yields an alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies, but 70% of the silanols remains unreacted.
Grafting corresponds to a replacement of one alkyl by a siloxy ligand and induces the isomerisation of the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene to an alkyl alkylidyne. Molecular (B3PW91) and periodic DFT-calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the alkyl ligands is replaced by a siloxy ligand. The change of the nature of the ligand is accompanied with a change of geometry: from a distorted tetrahedral structure for [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] to a butterfly-geometry with apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands for [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]. Finally, DFT calculations show that grafting occurs via a s-bond metathesis between the silanol and a metalalkyl bond and not through the typical addition of the silanol onto the alkylidene ligand.

Introduction Grafting well-defined metal complexes on oxides and partic- ularly silica has allowed the preparation of numerous well- defined surface complexes.1 This approach has been used to develop single-site heterogeneous catalysts for a wide range of applications (alkene hydrogenation, alkene polymerization and metathesis, alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis), which can be understood at a molecular level and thereby tuned through structurereactivity relationship.15 In the particular case of silica,it was noted very early that the silanols of silica surfaces can be advantageously used as efficient solid ligands to activate a metal center.6 Over the years, it has been shown that highly dehydroxylated silica, such as those obtained upon treatment under vacuum at 700 C (SiO2-(700)), contain mainly isolated silanols and can therefore be viewed as a large h1-siloxy ligand. Thus grafting metal complexes XMLn on SiO2-(700) can be used to quan- titatively generate the corresponding SiOMLn surface complexes along with one molecule of XH. Additionally, during this grafting step, no structural change is usually observed for the remaining spectator ligands.1 Here we show, through a combined use of ex- periment and theory, that grafting the perhydrocarbyl complex 1,[Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], a d2 ML4 bis-alkylidene complex, is not quantitative (presence of residual surface silanols) and yields aUniversit e de Lyon, Institut de Chimie de Lyon, C2P2, CNRSUniversit e Lyon 1ESCPE Lyon, ESCPE Lyon, F-308-43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69616, Villeurbanne Cedex, France.

DFT calculations were carried out to understand the observed metal fragment isomerisation of these d2 ML4 complexes upon grafting (bis-alkylidene alkyl alkylidyne), a process never observed for the corresponding d0 ML4 homologues.713 We describe the origin of the relative stabilities,determine grafting reaction pathways and discuss consequences.

Experimental All experiments were carried out by using standard air free methodology in a glove box under Ar, on a Schlenk line, or in Schlenk-type apparatus interfaced to a high vacuum line (10-5 Torr). The complex [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] (1) was pre- pared according to the literature procedure.14 CH2Cl2 was distilled over P2O5 and stored over 3 A molecular sieves. Pentane was distilled from NaK under N2. Propene and ethylene (U, Air liquide) were purified over R311 BASF catalyst/MS 4 A prior to use. Cis-2-pentene was degassed, distilled over Na and stored under 3 A molecular sieves. Silica (Aerosil Degussa, 200 m2g-1) was compacted with distilled water, calcined under air at 500 C for 2 h and treated under vacuum (500 C, 12 h and 700 C,4 h) (support referred to as SiO2-(700)). Gas-phase analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a KCl/Al2O3 on a fused silica column (50 m  0.32 mm). Elemental analysis was performed at the Mikroanalytisches Labor PASCHER in Germany. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 550-FT by using an infrared cell equipped with CaF2 windows, allowing in situ studies. Typically 16 scans were accumulated for each spectrum (resolution, 4 cm-1). Liquid state NMR spectra were recorded in C6D6 using a Bruker AC 300 spectrometer and solid state NMR spectra were recorded under MAS on a Bruker Avance This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Dalton Trans., 2009, 58795886  5879 Published on 17 March 2009.

The samples were introduced in a 4 mm zirconia rotor in the glove box and tightly closed. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield from SiMe4 ( 0.1 and 1 ppm for 1H and 13C NMR spectra,respectively).
Grafting of 1 on SiO2-(700) monitored by infrared spectroscopy Silica (2650 mg) was pressed into a 18 mm self-supporting disk and put into a sealed glass high-vacuum reactor equipped with CaF2 windows. After calcination at 500 C for 2 h, the silica disk was partially dehydroxylated under vacuum (500 C, 14 h and 700 C, 4 h). The disk was then immersed in a mixture of 1 (3 equiv./SiOH) in pentane (10 mL) at 25 C for 3.5 h followed by two pentane washings and a drying step under vacuum (10-5 Torr) at room temperature. An IR spectrum was recorded before and after impregnation.
Preparation of [1/SiO2-(700)] by impregnation A mixture of 1 (1 equiv. per SiOH) and SiO2-(700) (200 mg, 0.06 mmol OH) in pentane (5 mL) was stirred at 25 C for 3.5 h. After filtration, the solid was washed 4 times with pentane. The resulting colored powder was dried under vacuum (10-5 Torr, 30 min) to yield 197 mg of [1/SiO2-(700)]. Elemental analysis of [1/SiO2-(700)]: Os: 1.42%wt, C: 1.23%wt. 1H MAS NMR: 0.94 (CH2tBu), 1.18 (CtBu), 1.84 (SiOH), 3.29 (CHaHbtBu), 4.93 (CHaHbtBu). 13C CP MAS NMR: 22.6 (CH2tBu), 29.4 (CMe3), 35.3 (CH2CMe3), 53.6 (CCMe3).
Preparation of [1*/SiO2-(700)] This compound was prepared as the unlabelled compound starting with 5% 13C labeled [Os(=C*HtBu)2(C*H2tBu)2] pre- pared from 10% 13C labeled [Ta(=C*HtBu)(C*H2tBu)3]15 and [Os(O)2(CH2tBu)2].14 Reaction of propene with [1/SiO2-(700)] The solid [1/SiO2-(700)] (4 mmol Os) was loaded in a 38 mL reactor flask and propene (525 Torr, 1.0 mmol, 184 equiv.) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred and small aliquots were analysed by GC over time.
Reaction of ethene with [1/SiO2-(700)] The solid [1/SiO2-(700)] (4 mmol Os) was loaded in a 32 mL reactor flask and ethene (670 Torr, 1.1 mmol, 320 equiv.) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred and small aliquots were analysed by GC over time.
Reaction of cis-2-pentene with [1/SiO2-(700)] The solid [1/SiO2-(700)] (4 mmol) was loaded in a 38 mL reactor flask and cis-2-pentene (345 Torr, 0.8 mmol, 143 equiv.) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred and small aliquots were analysed by GC over time.

Computational details The Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)(X) and Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2(X) (X = CH2tBu or the siloxy group of amorphous silica surface) complexes have been modeled using two sets of molecular calculations: (1) a small DFT model where the tBu groups have been substituted by methyl groups and the surface is represented by OSiH3 (XQ) and (2) a large model computed using the ONIOM16 approach (XL) where all tBu groups have been included and the surface is represented by [OSi(OSiH3)3]. A fully DFT periodic model has also been used for the grafted complex (2) only (2S).
The reaction mechanisms have been explored only with the smaller (XQ) model.
Molecular DFT calculations have been performed with the hybrid B3PW91 density functional,17,18 as implemented in the Gaussian03 package.19 The Os and Si atoms have been represented with the quasi relativistic effective core pseudo-potentials (RECP) of the Stuttgart group and the associated basis sets augmented with a polarization function.2023 The C, H, N and O atoms have been represented with 6-31G(d,p) basis sets.24 For the ONIOM calculations, the calculations were conducted in two steps. The geometry optimization was carried out using a DFT/DFT approach. The inner layer is defined by the atoms present in the small model and the level of calculations is that used for the small model. The outer layer is calculated also at the DFT level but with a basis set with no polarization function on Os and Si and a 3-21G basis set for C, O and H. In a second step, single- point calculations with the basis set used for the inner layer were carried out. The geometry optimizations were performed without any symmetry constraint, and the nature of the extrema (local minima or transition states) was checked by analytical frequency calculations. The discussion of the results is based on the electronic energies E without any ZPE corrections because inclusion of the ZPE corrections does not significantly modify the results. The free energy values G have been computed with Gaussian03 at 298.15 K and P = 1 atm.
DFT periodic calculations, carried out with VASP,25,26 have been performed using a dehydroxylated (110) cristobalite model for sil- ica and a methodology described previously.2729 The calculations were carried out with the PBEPBE density functional30 and the projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism.31,32 As calibrated in earlier works,27 the plane-wave energy cut-off has been fixed to 400 eV and the Brillouin zone has been represented by a (2,2,1) mesh.

Experimental studies Grafting of 1 on silica [1/SiO2].
After immersing a silica disk partially dehydroxylated at 700 C (SiO2-(700), 0.26 mmol accessible OH/g of silica) for 3.5 h in a pale orange solution containing an excess of [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] (1) in pentane at 25 C, the disk was slightly coloured. After washing twice with pentane to remove the excess of complex and then drying under vacuum (10-5 Torr), recording an IR spectrum (Fig. S1) showed that the band attributed to isolated silanol groups at 3747 cm-1 decreased (35% free OH consumed), and a broad band appeared in agreement with the presence of the silanols interacting 5880  Dalton Trans., 2009, 58795886 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Published on 17 March 2009.

These bands are assigned to n(CH) and d(CH) vibrations of the alkyl ligands respectively. When grafting of 1 (1 equiv./OH) was carried out on larger quantities of a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C (SiO2-(700), 0.2 g, 0.052 mmol SiOH) by impregnation in pentane at 25 C over 3.5 h, silica homogeneously changed color and the solution was partially discolored. Osmium elemental analysis on the resulting solid was
1.41%wt. This loading corresponded to 0.074 mmol Os/g and
to the consumption of only ca. 30% of the available surface silanols (0.26 mmol OH/g for SiO2-(700)), which is consistent with IR data (vide supra). Note that a longer reaction time did not increase Os loading. Moreover, carbon elemental analysis is 1.23
0.1%wt, which corresponds to 14  1 C/Os and thereby shows
the presence of three remaining C5 ligands per Os. Moreover,this system was characterized by solid state NMR. First, the 1H MAS NMR spectrum of [1/SiO2] displays signals at 0.95, 1.2,
1.8, 3.3 and 4.9 ppm (Fig. S2a), clearly showing the absence of
alkylidene protons, expected at a much lower field (between 6 20 ppm). The two intense peaks at 0.95 and 1.2 ppm in a 2:1 relative intensity, are consistent with the presence of two types of tBu-containing ligands present in a 2-to-1 ratio. The peak at 1.8 ppm is typical of residual silanols, which is consistent with the low Os loadings and the IR data. Finally, the two peaks at 3.30 and 4.94 ppm, in a 1:1 ratio, were tentatively attributed to two diastereotopic protons of a neopentyl ligand by comparison with known molecular complexes.14 These data suggest the formation of [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (2-yne) in place of [(SiO)Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)] (2-bis-ene) (Scheme 1).
Scheme 1 Grafting of the bis-alkylidene complex 1 on SiO2-(700) and resulting surface complexes 2.
This attribution was further confirmed by
1H DQ NMR
(Fig. S3),33 by the presence of two off-diagonal correlations at the sum of the chemical shifts of these two protons, which shows that they are spatially close. This assignment is further corroborated by direct detection and CP-MAS 13C NMR of [1/SiO2] (Fig. S4):the two peaks in a 1:2 ratio at 22 and 29 ppm can be attributed to the methyl groups of the neopentylidyne and the neopentyl ligands, respectively; the corresponding quaternary carbons being also observed in a 1:2 ratio at 54 (CCMe3) and 35 (CH2CMe3) ppm. However, no peak associated with the carbons directly bound to Os can be detected. Note that this surface complex like 1 is not very stable (it fully decomposes at room temperature within 24h), which prevents the use of a long accumulation time. Using the corresponding 13C labelled compound [1*/SiO2] (5%), it was possible to detect, albeit with a poor signal to noise ratio, the alkylidyne and the methylene carbons of the neopentyl ligands at 263 ppm and 22 ppm, respectively (See Fig. S4bc). Note,however, that good quality spectra were difficult to obtain because of the low concentration of these species (partial grafting) and the thermal instability of these systems (48 h stability window at room temperature). Nonetheless, combining all the available data clearly shows that the reaction of [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] (1-bis- ene), a mixture of anti,anti- and anti,syn-bis-alkylidene complexes,with a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C gives 2-yne, a well- defined alkylidyne Os. This is noteworthy, because, in contrast to d0 ML4 complexes, for which no structural change has been observed, the metal fragment of this d2 ML4 Os complex changed from bis-alkylidene to alkyl alkylidyne upon grafting.1113 In terms of reactivity, [1/SiO2-(700)] reacts with propene (270 1600 equiv/Os) to give ethene (5.7 equiv), butenes (6.9 equiv),2,2-dimethylpropane (0.6 equiv), higher alkene homologues:pentenes (1.2 equiv), hexenes (4.1 equiv) and 3,3-dimethylbutene (1.7 ;equiv). The nature of the products clearly shows that several reactions concomitantly take place: alkene metathesis,dimerization (oxidative coupling) and isomerisation, albeit with a fast deactivation. Additionally, the reaction of [1/SiO2-(700)] with ethene (320 equiv) yields propene (0.5 equiv), 1-butene (0.3 equiv),cis- (0.2 equiv) and trans 2-butene (0.6 equiv). Finally, this reaction of [1/SiO2-(700)] with cis 2-pentene (210 equiv) yields mainly to the isomerisation of this substrate into a thermodynamic mixture of pentene isomers (18.8, 78.8 and 2.4% of cis 2-pentene, trans 2-pentene and 1-pentene) along with trace amounts of 3-hexenes (0.2 equiv), probably formed via metathesis. The overall reactivity of [1/SiO2-(700)] with alkenes shows that hydrides are probably generated in the presence of alkenes and catalyse isomerisation.
However, the high unstability of this system makes it an unsuitable catalyst precursor, in contrast to the equivalent d0 Systems [(SiO)M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (M = Mo11 and W12,13,34,35), which are highly efficient alkene metathesis catalysts.

Relative stability of bis-alkylidene vs. alkyl alkylidyne complexes.
The relative stability of bis-alkylidene and alkyl alkylidyne isomeric complexes depends on the identity of the spectator ligands.8,9 The bis-alkylidene [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] (1-bis-ene) is observed in the case of perhydrocarbyl complexes (and not the alkyl alkylidyne isomer [Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3],1-yne), while the contrary is found for the silica supported system,i.e. observation of [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (2-yne) rather than [(SiO)Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)] (2-bis-ene). These structural preferences have been investigated by DFT calculations using the three types of models described in the computational details: (1) small molecular models calculated at the full DFT level (XQ), (2) large molecular models calculated with the ONIOM approach (XL), (3) periodic surface models (XS).
Perhydrocarbyl complexes 1.
The bis-alkylidene complex [Os=CHR)2(CH2R)2] exists as three isomers differing by the position of the R group of the alkylidene ligands, anti (a) or syn (s). With the small molecular models (R = Me), the energies of the three bis-alkylidene isomers span only a 1.5 kcal mol-1 range with the following order of decreasing stability: (a,a)-, (s,a)-, and (s,s)- 1Q-bis-ene (Fig. 1). In contrast, the alkyl alkylidyne isomer 1Q-yne,[Os(CMe)(CH2Me)3], lies 14.7 kcal mol-1 above the most stable bis-alkylidene complex, (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene. With the large molecular models, the (s,a)-1L-bis-ene is marginally more stable than the (a,a)-isomer (-1.5 kcal mol-1), but the (s,s)-isomer has not been This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Dalton Trans., 2009, 58795886  5881 Published on 17 March 2009.

Fig. 1 Optimised geometries for bis-alkylidene and alkyl alkylidyne isomers of the perhydrocarbyl complex 1 obtained by calculations and corresponding schematic structures with: (a) the small 1Q (R = CH3) and (b) the large model 1L (R = tBu). located as a minimum on the potential energy surface, probably because of steric crowding associated with the two tBu groups of the alkylidene ligands pointing towards each other. The alkyl alkylidyne complex 1L-yne remains significantly higher in energy,i.e. 16.2 kcal mol-1 above the most stable (s,a)-1L-bis-ene isomer.
In terms of the structure, the bis-alkylidene complexes 1Q-bis- ene have distorted tetrahedral geometries with an angle of ca. 124between the two alkyl groups and a smaller one between the two coplanar alkylidene ligands, which is 99, 107to 115 for (a,a)-, (s,a)- and (s,s)-1Q-bis-ene, respectively. For 1L-bis- ene, the steric bulk of the tBu group marginally modifies the geometries: the angles between the two neopentyl ligands and the two neopentylidene ligands in the (s,a)-isomer are 122and 111,respectively, and they are 126and 94in the (a,a)-isomer. The alkyl alkylidyne complexes, 1Q-yne and 1L-yne, adopt a trigonal pyramidal structure with one alkyl ligand at the apical position;the alkylidyne being one of the three basal ligands. Overall, the cal- culated relative energies are in good agreement with experimental observations, i.e. the (s,a)- and (a,a)-1-bis-ene are the only observed complexes with the former being slightly more abundant.14 Siloxy complexes 2.
Replacing one alkyl by a siloxy ligand greatly changes the relative stabilities of bis-alkylidene and alkyl alkylidyne complexes (Fig. 2). With the small molecular models,the alkyl alkylidyne complex, 2Q-yne, lies only 0.7 kcal mol-1 above (a,a)-2Q-bis-ene, the most stable bis-alkylidene isomer. The three bis-alkylidene isomers are in decreasing order of stability: (a,a)-,(s,a)-, (s,s)-2Q-bis-ene, as already found for 1Q-bis-ene, but with a larger energy span of 4.8 kcal mol-1. With the large molecular models, the alkyl alkylidyne complex 2L-yne is the most stable isomer, the (a,a)- and (s,a)-2L-bis-ene being 4.9 and 5.4 kcal mol-1 Fig. 2 Optimised geometries for bis-alkylidene and alkyl alkylidyne iso- mers of the siloxy complex 2 obtained by calculations and corresponding schematic structures with: (a) the small model 2Q (R = CH3; X = H),(b) the large model 2L (R = tBu; X = OSiH3), (c) the periodic surface 2S model (R = tBu; X = O of silica surface). above 2L-yne, respectively. The (s,s)-isomer has not been located as for the perhydrocarbyl case (1L-bis-ene). Using the cristobalite surface models, the alkyl alkylidyne complex 2S-yne is also more stable than the bis-alkylidene complexes by 0.4 and 3.6 kcal mol-1 for (a,a)- and (s,a)-2S-bis-ene, respectively.
In terms of structure, the bis-alkylidene siloxy complexes 2-bis- ene resemble the bis-alkylidene perhydrocarbyl complexes 1-bis- ene. In contrast, the alkyl alkylidyne siloxy complexes 2-yne have a butterfly structure with a large angle between the alkylidyne and the siloxy ligands (153for 2Q-yne, 145for 2L-yne and 154for 2S-yne) and a small one between the two alkyl ligands (101for 2Q-yne, 87for 2L-yne and 93for 2S-yne).
On the origin of structural preferences.
The geometry of these tetra-coordinated d2 ML4 complexes significantly varies with the identity of the spectator ligand. The perhydrocarbyl and the siloxy bis-alkylidene complexes have both a pseudo-tetrahedral structure. In contrast, the corresponding alkylidyne isomers adopt 5882  Dalton Trans., 2009, 58795886 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Published on 17 March 2009. Downloaded by Temple University on 30/10/2014 04:29:55. different geometries: a trigonal pyramidal structure with an apical alkyl group for the perhydrocarbyl complex vs. a butterfly structure with a siloxy ligand nearly trans to the alkylidyne for the siloxy complex. The unique tetrahedral geometry for the bis- alkylidene and the two geometries for the alkylidyne complexes can be rationalized by a qualitative energy diagram (Scheme 2).
As already described for d0 ML4 group 6 and Re complexes,the degeneracy within the e and t2 orbital sets is lifted by the presence of the p-bonds.36 Therefore, for the three coordination geometries, the diagrams show the presence of a non-degenerated non-bonding d orbital able to accommodate the 2 electrons of OsVI and another two d-orbitals spatially orientated to establish the OsC p-bonds associated with the two alkylidene or the alkylidyne ligands. For the butterfly structure, the p-bonds are formed with two non-bonding metal d orbitals, while in the case of the tetrahedron one of the p-bonds uses a metal d orbital with some s-bond antibonding character. What distinguishes these three isomers is the trans effect associated with the s-bonded Os- ligands. In a tetrahedron, there is no mutually trans ligand thus allowingtheaccommodationofligandswithalargetranseffectlike perhydrocarbyls. In the case of a butterfly structure, the two apical ligands are mutually trans, and it is preferable that one of them has a weak trans effect (i.e. siloxy ligand). Since the alkylidyne occupies the other apical site due to the dppp interactions, the preferred structure has apical alkylidyne and siloxy ligands. This leaves a lone pair on the metal pointing away from two basal ligands. In contrast to the butterfly structure, the trigonal pyramid has no ligand trans to each other, but three coplanar basal ligands,which exert a moderate mutual trans effect. As a consequence,the trigonal pyramid can be a high lying minimum, above the preferred tetrahedral structure when all basal ligands have strong trans effect such as for the perhydrocarbyl complex.

The p label indicates the orbitals that have the proper symmetry to enter dp/pp interactions. The two electrons on Os have been localized in the orbital that is occupied according to the calculations.
The d0 ML4 group 6 complexes and presently studied d2 ML4 Os complexes have different structural preferences. The alkyl alkylidyne d0 ML4 complexes are more stable than the bis- alkylidene isomers and adopt a pseudo-tetrahedral geometry, e.g. [M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] and [(SiO)M(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (Mo11 and W12,13). Computational studies have shown that this preference is in fact general.710 In contrast, the structural preference is ligand dependant for d2 complexes. One clear difference between the d0 and d2 species is that alkyl-alkylidyne d2 complexes adopt a butterfly structure. Because of the large angle between two ligands in a butterfly structure, trans effects are important and lead in turn to a noticeable influence of the type of ligands (strong vs. weak s-donor ligands) on the relative energy of bis-alkylidene vs. alkyl-alkylidyne isomers. In the case of perhydrocarbyl ligands,no alkyl-alkylidyne d2 OsL4 complex has been characterized;however such a species was proposed as an intermediate to account for H/D-isotope exchanges in bis-alkylidene complexes.
Such an intermediate could be trapped as a bis-pyridine adduct [(TfO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3(Py)2].14 Noteworthy coordination of additional ligands on ML4 d0 complexes induces the reverse effect and stabilizes the bis-alkylidene isomers.9,10 Overall, the calculated relative stabilities obtained with the three models are consistent with experiment: the observed structure of the silica supported system corresponds to an alkyl alkylidyne surface complex 2-yne, while it is the bis-alkylidene (1-bis-ene) for the perhydrocarbyl complex. Additionally, calculations show that 2-yne probably adopts a butterfly structure and that the geometry at the metal center changes upon grafting in the case of a d2 ML4 system. This is in sharp contrast with what has been observed for d0 alkylidene28,3740 or alkylidyne1113,37 ML4 systems since they keep their tetrahedral geometry upon grafting. Noteworthy the butterfly structure bonded to the surface via one of the apical sites has a lone pair on the metal pointing away from the two basal alkyl ligands and thus taking the place of a fifth coordination site.
4.2.2.
Grafting reaction pathways.
To further understand the formation of 2-yne from 1-bis-ene, the reaction pathways describing the grafting on silica have been investigated by DFT calculations within the molecular approach using the small models (XQ) and the most stable (a,a)-isomer of the bis-alkylidene complex, (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene.
Four pathways differing by their first step have been found:(1) Reaction of the silanol with one metalligand s-bond of (a,a)-1-bis-ene yielding (a,a)-2-bis-ene and an alkane (Pathway 1,s-bond metathesis, Scheme 3),(2) Addition of the silanol to the metalligand p-bond of (a,a)- 1-bis-ene yielding a pentacoordinated trisalkylalkylidene complex (Pathway 2: [1,2]-addition, Scheme 3),(3) Isomerisation of (a,a)-1-bis-ene into 1-yne before grafting (Pathway 3, Scheme 4),(4) Isomerisation of (a,a)-1-bis-ene into 1-yne upon grafting (Pathway 4, Scheme 4).
We describe the results of the calculations using the electronic energies E and then the free energies G (values in parentheses in Schemes 3 and 4).
Note first that the reaction energies of 1Q-bis-ene plus silanol giving either 2Q-bis-ene or 2Q-yne plus an alkane are -23.2 and -22.5 kcal mol-1, respectively; showing that the anchoring process of this Os complex on silica is highly exothermic.
Pathway 1.
Reaction of the silanol with one metalligand s-bond of (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene occurs via a five coordinated TBP transition state with the apical siloxy group being trans to either an alkyl or an alkylidene ligand with associated energy barriers of 30.1 and 22.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. This yields RCH3 and This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Dalton Trans., 2009, 58795886  5883 Published on 17 March 2009. Downloaded by Temple University on 30/10/2014 04:29:55.

Energy barriers are given above reaction arrows with respect to the starting point of the elementary step. All energy values are given in kcal mol-1 and those in parentheses correspond to free energies.
(a,a)-2Q-bis-ene with a favourable energy of reaction of -23.2 kcal mol-1. The most favourable transition state has one alkylidene trans to the siloxy group since this orientation favours the distortion of the initial tetrahedron, which has no vacant site.
Conversion of (a,a)-2Q-bis-ene into 2Q-yne is almost athermic, but it requires another high energy step to form the OsVIII hydrido intermediate 3Q which lies 23.1 kcal mol-1 above (a,a)-2Q-bis-ene.
Pathway 2.
[1,2]-Addition of the OH bond to one of the metalligand p-bonds of (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene occurs via five coordi- nated TBP transition states with the apical siloxy group being trans to either an alkyl or an alkylidene ligand with energy barriers of
38.4 and 29.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. These two transition states
lead to two pentacoordinated trisalkylalkylidenesiloxy complexes with either an alkyl (4aQ) or an alkylidene (4bQ) trans to the siloxy ligand with a slightly favourable energy of reaction of -0.4 and -5.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. Like in the first step of Pathway 1, the approach of the siloxy group trans to the alkylidene is much more favoured, but [1,2]-addition is strongly disfavoured compared to s-bond metathesis (Pathway 1). These intermediates 4Q can evolve via a-H abstraction into 2Q-yne and RCH3 directly with an energy barrier of 22.3 kcal mol-1. Alternatively, this can take place in three steps via formation of (a,a)-2Q-bis-ene, but it involves much higher transition states (ca. 40 kcal mol-1 above the most stable intermediate 4bQ).
Pathway 3.
First, (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene undergoes isomerisation into 1Q-yne in a two-step process starting with an a-H transfer of the alkylidene hydrogen onto Os leading to a high energy OsVIII hydrido intermediate 5Q followed by the migration of the hydride ligand to the remaining alkylidene ligand. The a-H transfer step has an energy barrier of 36.5 kcal mol-1 and leads to 5Q, which lies 27.8 kcal mol-1 above (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene. Species 5Q evolves with an energy barrier of 6.9 kcal mol-1 into the more stable 1Q-yne,which lies 14.7 kcal mol-1 above (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene. Coordination of the silanol stabilizes 1Q-yne either as square-based pyramid [1Q-yne·SiOH-SBP] or trigonal bipyramid [1Q-yne·SiOH-TBP] adducts, but they are still less stable than separated reactants by 6.2 and 8.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. The TBP adduct [1Q-yne·SiOH- TBP] directly gives 2Q-yne and RCH3 via s-bond metathesis with a relatively low energy barrier of 8.9 kcal mol-1. Alternatively, H-transfer of the silanol to the alkylidyne ligand in [1Q-yne·SiOH- SBP] gives 2Q-yne via 4aQ, but this step requires a much higher energy barrier of 33.2 kcal mol-1.
Pathway 4.The (a,a)-1-bis-ene can also give [1Q-yne·SiOH- TBP] via a two-step process starting by an a-H transfer upon coordination of silanol followed by a-H migration. The resulting hexacoordinated intermediate [5Q·SiOH] lies 22.5 kcal mol-1 above the separated reactants and requires a relatively high energy barrier of 34.6 kcal mol-1, and it evolves into [1Q-yne·SiOH-TBP] with a low barrier of 6.3 kcal mol-1. From this intermediate, 2Q-yne can be obtained as described in Pathway 3.
Comparison between these grafting mechanisms is best carried out considering Gibbs free energies (G) because of the change of molecularities at different stages of the reaction pathways (values in parenthesis in Schemes 3 and 4 plus Fig. 3). In the first step of Pathways 1, 2 and 4, the energies of the transition states increase, because of the loss of translational entropy associated with the participation of the silanol. In contrast, no such loss of translational entropy affects the first step of Pathway 3. As a result, the activation energies of the first step of Pathways 1 and 3 are comparable (within 1.5 kcal mol-1) and much lower that these associated with Pathways 2 and 4 (6.5 and 12.4 kcal mol-1 higher in free energies compared to Pathway 1, respectively).
Therefore, grafting of the bisalkylidene perhydrocarbyl complex 1-bis-ene to form the siloxy supported alkylidyne complex 2-yne can take place via two accessible pathways (Pathways 1 and 3,5884  Dalton Trans., 2009, 58795886 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Published on 17 March 2009. Downloaded by Temple University on 30/10/2014 04:29:55.Fig. 3 Free energy profiles for Pathways 1 and 3 and entry points for Pathways 2 and 4. For Pathway 3, 1Q/SiO2 represents the most stable pentacoordinated silanol adduct of 1Q-yne and corresponds to 1Q-yne-SiOH-SBP. All free energy values are given in parentheses with respect to separated reactants ((a,a)-1-bis-ene and SiOH); parentheses with a  indicate that it corresponds to a transition state.
Fig. 3). Both involve a s-bond metathesis between OH and Malkyl bonds, occurring on either the bis-alkylidene (1-bis-ene) or the alkyl alkylidyne complex (1-yne). The major difference be- tween Pathways 1 and 3 is that the former implies a grafting process associated with two elementary steps with high energy barriers (33 and 31.5 kcal mol-1) while the latter has a rather flat free energy profile, after a first step requiring an activation barrier of
34.5 kcal mol-1. Experimental results showed the selective forma-
tion of 2-yne at room temperature and the absence of intermediates like 2-bis-ene. Therefore, combining experimental and theoretical data suggest that Pathway 3 is the most likely grafting process.
Note also that both kinetic and thermodynamic considerations favour the formation of 2-yne upon reaction of 1-bis-ene with a silanol.

Conclusion Grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes,[Os(=CHtBu)2- (CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C se- lectively yields an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)- (CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies. However, only 30% of the surface silanols react, independently of reaction time. The grafting process corresponds to a replacement of one alkyl by a siloxy ligand along with an isomerisation of the metal fragments from a bis- alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne. DFT calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand. This also induces a change of geometry from a distorted tetrahedron into a butterfly structure having apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands, and a lone pair occupying the position of a fifth coordination site. Investigation of grafting reaction pathways shows that s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond of either the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, stabilized by the coordination of a silanol, is favoured; the latter being preferred because it involves a rather flat free energy profile and because the bis-alkylidene intermediate has not been experimentally observed. Note that the surface chemistry of this d2 Os complex greatly differs from what has been observed for d0 alkylidene complexes in several aspects:for the latter (1) grafting involves either [1,2]-addition of the silanol on the alkylidene (Ta37 and Re38) or direct s-bond metathesis without isomerisation (Mo39,40 and W28), (2) grafting is typically quantitative and (3) no major change of geometry/structure is observed. This suggest that the low Os loading, independently of reaction time and despite a highly favoured thermodynamic for grafting, results from the different reactivity of surface silanols,probably induced by their local environment, i.e. the presence or not of neighboring siloxane bridges. The heterogeneity of silica surfaces has been previously observed in related studies concerning the formation of zirconium hydride surface species33c and the presence of various sites in Cr-based polymerisation catalysts.41 Here, grafting leads to an isomerisation of the d2 ML4 fragment from a tetrahedron into a butterfly structure, where a lone pair occupies a fifth coordination site. While this process could readily occur on some more readily accessible silanols (30%), it could be hindered for most sites (70%) having relatively close siloxane bridges; the direct consequence being a lower metal loading. This study provides more evidence for the heterogeneous environment of silanols on amorphous silica surface, but further investigation on the nature and the role of this heterogeneity on structure and activity is clearly needed.
