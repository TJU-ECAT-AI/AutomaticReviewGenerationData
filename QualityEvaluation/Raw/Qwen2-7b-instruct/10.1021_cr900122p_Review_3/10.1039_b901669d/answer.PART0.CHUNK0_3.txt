[1] "Grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes, [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C selectively yields an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies."
[2] "However, only 30% of the surface silanols react, independently of reaction time."
[3] "DFT calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand."
[4] "This also induces a change of geometry from a distorted tetrahedron into a butterfly structure having apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands, and a lone pair occupying the position of a fifth coordination site."
[5] "Investigation of grafting reaction pathways shows that s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond of either the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, stabilized by the coordination of a silanol, is favoured; the latter being preferred because it involves a rather flat free energy profile and because the bis-alkylidene intermediate has not been experimentally observed."

The study reveals that the grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes onto silica partially dehydroxylated at 700°C results in the formation of an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]. This transformation is energetically favored, with the bis-alkylidene being the preferred isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex. Replacing one alkyl ligand with a siloxy ligand not only changes the geometry from a distorted tetrahedron to a butterfly structure, but also increases the stability of the alkyl alkylidyne isomer. The process is driven by s-bond metathesis, which is favored over other mechanisms due to its lower activation energy. However, only 30% of the surface silanols participate in the reaction, suggesting that the reactivity of surface silanols may be influenced by their local environment.

研究发现，将Os二烷基金属络合物嫁接到部分脱水至700°C的硅酸盐上，可生成烷基烷基烯丙基复合物[(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]。这一转变在能量上是被优先考虑的，对于氢化碳络合物，二烷基络合物是首选异构体。用较弱的烷氧基取代一个烷基不仅改变了几何形状，从扭曲的四面体变为蝴蝶状结构，而且增加了烷基烷基烯丙基异构体的稳定性。这一过程由σ键裂解驱动，其优势在于较低的活化能。然而，只有30%的表面硅醇参与反应，这表明表面硅醇的反应性可能受到其局部环境的影响。
