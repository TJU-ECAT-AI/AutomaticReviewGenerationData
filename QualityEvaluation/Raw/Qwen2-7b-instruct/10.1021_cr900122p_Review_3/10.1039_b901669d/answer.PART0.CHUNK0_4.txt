<p>The grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes, [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C selectively yields an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(SiO)Os(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies.</p>
<p>However, only 30% of the surface silanols react, independently of reaction time.</p>
<p>The grafting process corresponds to a replacement of one alkyl by a siloxy ligand along with an isomerisation of the metal fragments from a bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne.</p>
<p>DFT calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand.</p>
<p>This also induces a change of geometry from a distorted tetrahedron into a butterfly structure having apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands, and a lone pair occupying the position of a fifth coordination site.</p>
<p>Investigation of grafting reaction pathways shows that s-bond metathesis of a metalalkyl bond of either the bis-alkylidene complex or the adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, stabilized by the coordination of a silanol, is favoured; the latter being preferred because it involves a rather flat free energy profile and because the bis-alkylidene intermediate has not been experimentally observed.</p>

The preparation of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides involves distinct mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions. For silica-supported zirconium hydrides, H/D exchange typically occurs via [1,2]-addition of the silanol to the alkylidene ligand. This process is favored over direct s-bond metathesis, as it involves a lower activation energy. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, often exhibit direct s-bond metathesis without isomerization during the grafting process. The selectivity of these reactions can be influenced by factors such as reaction rates, which are determined by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the involved reactions. In terms of chain walking, the ability of the catalyst to move along the alkane chain for metathesis reactions may vary depending on the support material and the specific conditions of the reaction. The role of hydrogenolysis in these processes can also play a significant part in determining the overall selectivity of the reactions, as it can lead to side reactions that compete with the desired C-H bond activation.

在硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物的制备中，它们在C-H键活化反应中的机制存在显著差异。对于硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物，H/D交换通常通过将硅醇添加到烷基酮基团上实现。这一过程由于其较低的活化能而被优先考虑。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物往往表现出直接的σ键互换，而无需异构化即可进行接枝过程。这些反应的选择性可以由反应速率等因素决定，这些因素由涉及反应的热力学和动力学确定。关于链行走，在这些过程中，催化剂沿烷烃链进行代谢的能力可能因支持材料和反应条件的不同而有所不同。氢解离在这些过程中也可能扮演重要角色，因为它可能导致与所需C-H键活化竞争的副反应。
