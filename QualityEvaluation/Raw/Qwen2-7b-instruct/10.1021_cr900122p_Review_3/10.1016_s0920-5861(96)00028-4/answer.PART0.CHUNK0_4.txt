C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products.

The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn.

Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites. Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2).

The mechanism in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involves the sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane aromatization turnover. This limits the rate and selectivity of the reaction on H-ZSM5. The initial dehydrogenation of propane to propene, rapid oligomerization-cracking of alkene intermediates, and the cyclization and aromatization of these alkenes into stable C6+ aromatics occur in parallel with acid-catalyzed and thermal cracking reactions to form methane and ethane.

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit comparable rates of C-H bond activation across the mentioned materials, albeit with enhanced rates of chemical conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuteration upon introduction of Ga and Zn cations. The formation of propene is notably faster on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, yet the C-H bond activation dynamics remain unaffected by the presence of these metals. The catalytic activity of Ga and Zn sites facilitates the recombination of hydrogen atoms derived from C-H bond cleavage, thereby accelerating propene formation and enhancing aromatic selectivity. Acid sites within the Brönsted framework are primarily responsible for C-H bond activation, with Ga and Zn cations enabling more efficient turnover of these sites without the necessity for hydrogen transfer or cracking reactions. This mechanism ensures the rapid and selective conversion of light alkanes into valuable products, such as aromatic compounds and hydrogen, by bypassing the formation of undesired by-products like methane and ethane.

在二氧化硅负载的锆化氢和氧化铝负载的钍化氢中，C-H键活化的速率在上述材料之间相当，但引入镓和锌离子后，化学转化、氢解离和从D2引入反应产物中的氘原子的速率增加。丙烯的形成在Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上显著更快，但C-H键活化速率对镓和锌的存在依赖性较弱。镓和锌位点通过促进酸位点的氢原子重新组合成全部氢（H2），加速丙烯的形成并提高芳烃的选择性。酸位点主要负责C-H键活化，而镓和锌位点使这些位点的周转更高效，无需氢转移或裂解反应。这种机制确保了轻烷基化合物快速、选择性地转化为有价值的产物，如芳香化合物和氢气，同时避免生成诸如甲烷和乙烷等副产品。
