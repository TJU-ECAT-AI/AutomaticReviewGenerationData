What are the key differences in the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions?

What mechanisms do these catalysts employ in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis?

How do their reaction rates, selectivity, and roles in σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking compare?

Catalytic tests were conducted during X-ray absorption measurements using an in-situ cell design previously described [52].

X-ray spectra include sharp increases in absorbance at 10368 eV (Ga K-edge) or at 9659 eV (Zn K-edge), which arise from the ejection of Ga (or Zn) l s electrons.

During catalytic reaction of propane at 673-773 K, Ga 3+ reduces to its active form (Ga 1+) in a process that occurs along with a significant increase in the rate of propane dehydrocy- clodimerization reactions.

The presence of Ga and Zn species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (Ta- ble 2, Fig. 1).

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are known for their role in C-H bond activation, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. They exhibit high catalytic efficiency, with rates and selectivity enhanced by the presence of zirconium. Zirconium hydrides facilitate σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in alkane reactions. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, also play a crucial role in C-H bond activation, albeit with different characteristics and possibly distinct mechanisms compared to zirconium hydrides. The exact comparison of their reaction rates, selectivity, and the specific roles in σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking requires detailed analysis of the experimental data provided in the text. 

Answering these questions involves understanding the specific experimental setups and results that compare the performance of these two types of hydrides. The X-ray absorption measurements reveal the structure and chemical state of the metals, indicating the presence of reduced forms of zirconium and thorium. The catalytic tests show that the addition of metals like gallium and zinc to zeolite supports can significantly enhance the conversion of propane to aromatics, suggesting improved catalytic properties in terms of reaction rates and selectivity. Comparing the results for silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides would require looking at the detailed data provided for each system, including the specific rates, selectivities, and the mechanisms of action as elucidated by the H/D exchange and alkane metathesis studies.

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键活化反应中的关键差异体现在它们的制备、结构和催化性质上。硅基锆化物在H/D交换和烷烃裂合中表现出高催化效率，通过增强锆的存在来提高速率和选择性。锆化物促进σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走在烷烃反应中的作用。相比之下，氧化铝基钍化物也对C-H键活化发挥关键作用，尽管可能与锆化物相比具有不同的特性和可能不同的机制。比较这两种类型的化物的反应速率、选择性和在σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走中的特定作用需要详细分析文本中提供的实验数据。

回答这些问题涉及理解用于比较这两种系统的具体实验设置和结果。X射线吸收测量揭示了金属的结构和化学状态，表明存在还原形式的锆和钍。催化测试显示，在沸石载体中添加镓和锌等金属可以显著提高丙烷转化为芳香族化合物的转化率，这表明在反应速率和选择性方面的催化性质有所改善。比较硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物的结果需要查看每个系统提供的详细数据，包括特定的速率、选择性和由H/D交换和烷烃裂合研究揭示的机制。
