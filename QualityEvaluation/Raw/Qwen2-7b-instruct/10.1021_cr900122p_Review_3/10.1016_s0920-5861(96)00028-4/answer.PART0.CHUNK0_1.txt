[1] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate,and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorp- tion, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products."

The literature discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The key differences lie in their supports and the nature of the metal hydrides. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are noted for their enhanced C-H bond activation abilities, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are also capable of these reactions, but their mechanisms differ due to the different metal and support materials. Reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are central to understanding these processes. The literature emphasizes that modifications with exchanged Ga and Zn cations in zeolite supports like H-ZSM5 can significantly boost hydrogen disposal rates, propane turnover, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies reveal that C-H bond activation rates are comparable across H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, indicating a similar mechanism. However, Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation, enhancing the catalytic efficiency of these systems.

文献讨论了硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。关键区别在于它们的支撑材料和金属化氢化合物的性质。硅基锆化物在H/D交换和烷烃互变异构反应中表现出增强的C-H键激活能力。氧化铝基钍化物也具备这些反应，但由于不同的金属和支撑材料，其机制有所不同。反应速率、选择性和σ键互变异构、氢解离和链行走的作用是理解这些过程的核心。文献强调，在如H-ZSM5等沸石支持的系统中，通过交换镓和锌离子可以显著提高氢的处置速率、丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性。同位素研究揭示了H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5中的C-H键激活速率相似，表明了类似的机制。然而，镓和锌离子增加了化学丙烷转化、重组合氢解离和D-原子整合的速率，提高了这些系统的催化效率。
