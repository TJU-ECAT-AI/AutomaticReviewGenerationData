[1] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products."
[2] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
[3] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites."
[4] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all hydrogen (H2). This removal of H-atoms by the recombination is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes."

1. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were found to increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity. The studies indicated that C-H bond activation occurred at comparable rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but the exchange of Ga and Zn ions accelerated chemical propane conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation into reaction products.

2. The initial propene formation rate was notably higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5. However, isotopic data from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures revealed that the C-H bond activation rate was not significantly influenced by the presence of Ga and Zn.

3. Over Na-ZSM5, it was confirmed that C-H bond activation predominantly occurred on Brönsted acid sites.

4. Ga and Zn functioned as 'portholes' that catalyzed the recombination of H-atoms, derived from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, into all hydrogen (H2). This hydrogen recombination process facilitated the removal of H-atoms, minimizing the formation of by-products like methane and ethane, and enhancing the extraction of valuable H2 from light alkanes with high selectivity.

1. 在这种五硅铝酸盐改性后，镓和锌的离子增加氢的丢弃率、丙烷转化率以及芳香选择性。研究显示，在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上，C-H键活化速率相似，但交换后的镓和锌离子加速了丙烷的化学转化、重组合氢解离以及从反应产物中引入D-原子的速率。

2. 镓/H-ZSM5和锌/H-ZSM5上的初始丙烯形成速率明显高于H-ZSM5。然而，来自C3H8/C3D8混合物的同位素数据表明，C-H键活化速率对镓和锌的存在依赖性较弱。

3. 在Na-ZSM5上，证实了C-H键活化主要发生在Brönsted酸性位点上。

4. 镓和锌作为“港口”，催化了由酸催化C-H键断裂产生的氢的再组合为全部氢（H2）。这一氢再组合过程促进了H-原子的去除，减少了甲烷和乙烷等副产品的形成，并提高了从轻烷烃中高选择性提取有价值H2的能力。
