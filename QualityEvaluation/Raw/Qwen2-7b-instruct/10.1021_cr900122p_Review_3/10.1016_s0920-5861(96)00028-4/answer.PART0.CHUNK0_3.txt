<question>
Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

Unfortunately, the provided document does not contain specific details about the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It focuses on the dehydrocyclodimerization of light alkanes on modified H-ZSM5 zeolites, including the role of metal cations and acid sites in these reactions. There are no references to zirconium hydrides or thorium hydrides, nor any information on their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis. 

Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested comparison and contrasts regarding the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions.

不幸的是，提供的文档并未包含关于二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构或催化性能的特定细节。它主要关注了在H-ZSM5改性沸石上轻烷烃的脱氢二聚反应，包括金属离子和酸中心在这类反应中的作用。文档中没有提及锆化物或钍化物，也没有关于它们在H/D交换或烷烃环化方面的机制、反应速率、选择性和σ键环化、氢解离和链行走在它们活性中的意义的相关信息。

因此，我无法提供关于二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质的比较和对比。
