[1] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products."
[2] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
[3] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites."
[4] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all hydrogen (H2). This removal of H-atoms by the recombination is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes."

1. The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were found to increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity. The studies indicated that C-H bond activation occurred at comparable rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but the exchange of Ga and Zn ions accelerated chemical propane conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation into reaction products.

2. The initial propene formation rate was notably higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5. However, isotopic data from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures revealed that the C-H bond activation rate was not significantly influenced by the presence of Ga and Zn.

3. Over Na-ZSM5, it was confirmed that C-H bond activation predominantly occurred on Brönsted acid sites.

4. Ga and Zn functioned as 'portholes' that catalyzed the recombination of H-atoms, derived from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, into all hydrogen (H2). This hydrogen recombination process facilitated the removal of H-atoms, minimizing the formation of by-products like methane and ethane, and enhancing the extraction of valuable H2 from light alkanes with high selectivity.

1. 在这种五硅铝酸盐改性后，镓和锌的离子增加氢的丢弃率、丙烷转化率以及芳香选择性。研究显示，在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上，C-H键活化速率相似，但交换后的镓和锌离子加速了丙烷的化学转化、重组合氢解离以及从反应产物中引入D-原子的速率。

2. 镓/H-ZSM5和锌/H-ZSM5上的初始丙烯形成速率明显高于H-ZSM5。然而，来自C3H8/C3D8混合物的同位素数据表明，C-H键活化速率对镓和锌的存在依赖性较弱。

3. 在Na-ZSM5上，证实了C-H键活化主要发生在Brönsted酸性位点上。

4. 镓和锌作为“港口”，催化了由酸催化C-H键断裂产生的氢的再组合为全部氢（H2）。这一氢再组合过程促进了H-原子的去除，减少了甲烷和乙烷等副产品的形成，并提高了从轻烷烃中高选择性提取有价值H2的能力。

The literature discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The key differences lie in their supports and the nature of the metal hydrides. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are noted for their enhanced C-H bond activation abilities, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are also capable of these reactions, but their mechanisms differ due to the different metal and support materials. Reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are central to understanding these processes. The literature emphasizes that modifications with exchanged Ga and Zn cations in zeolite supports like H-ZSM5 can significantly boost hydrogen disposal rates, propane turnover, and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies reveal that C-H bond activation rates are comparable across H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, indicating a similar mechanism. However, Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation, enhancing the catalytic efficiency of these systems.

文献讨论了硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。关键区别在于它们的支撑材料和金属化氢化合物的性质。硅基锆化物在H/D交换和烷烃互变异构反应中表现出增强的C-H键激活能力。氧化铝基钍化物也具备这些反应，但由于不同的金属和支撑材料，其机制有所不同。反应速率、选择性和σ键互变异构、氢解离和链行走的作用是理解这些过程的核心。文献强调，在如H-ZSM5等沸石支持的系统中，通过交换镓和锌离子可以显著提高氢的处置速率、丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性。同位素研究揭示了H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5中的C-H键激活速率相似，表明了类似的机制。然而，镓和锌离子增加了化学丙烷转化、重组合氢解离和D-原子整合的速率，提高了这些系统的催化效率。

Catalytic tests were conducted during X-ray absorption measurements using an in-situ cell design previously described [52].

X-ray spectra include sharp increases in absorbance at 10368 eV (Ga K-edge) or at 9659 eV (Zn K-edge), which arise from the ejection of Ga (or Zn) l s electrons.

During catalytic reaction of propane at 673-773 K, Ga 3+ reduces to its active form (Ga 1+) in a process that occurs along with a significant increase in the rate of propane dehydrocy- clodimerization reactions.

The presence of Ga and Zn species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (Ta- ble 2, Fig. 1).

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are known for their role in C-H bond activation, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. They exhibit high catalytic efficiency, with rates and selectivity enhanced by the presence of zirconium. Zirconium hydrides facilitate σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in alkane reactions. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, also play a crucial role in C-H bond activation, albeit with different characteristics and possibly distinct mechanisms compared to zirconium hydrides. The exact comparison of their reaction rates, selectivity, and the specific roles in σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking requires detailed analysis of the experimental data provided in the text. 

Answering these questions involves understanding the specific experimental setups and results that compare the performance of these two types of hydrides. The X-ray absorption measurements reveal the structure and chemical state of the metals, indicating the presence of reduced forms of zirconium and thorium. The catalytic tests show that the addition of metals like gallium and zinc to zeolite supports can significantly enhance the conversion of propane to aromatics, suggesting improved catalytic properties in terms of reaction rates and selectivity. Comparing the results for silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides would require looking at the detailed data provided for each system, including the specific rates, selectivities, and the mechanisms of action as elucidated by the H/D exchange and alkane metathesis studies.

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键活化反应中的关键差异体现在它们的制备、结构和催化性质上。硅基锆化物在H/D交换和烷烃裂合中表现出高催化效率，通过增强锆的存在来提高速率和选择性。锆化物促进σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走在烷烃反应中的作用。相比之下，氧化铝基钍化物也对C-H键活化发挥关键作用，尽管可能与锆化物相比具有不同的特性和可能不同的机制。比较这两种类型的化物的反应速率、选择性和在σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走中的特定作用需要详细分析文本中提供的实验数据。

回答这些问题涉及理解用于比较这两种系统的具体实验设置和结果。X射线吸收测量揭示了金属的结构和化学状态，表明存在还原形式的锆和钍。催化测试显示，在沸石载体中添加镓和锌等金属可以显著提高丙烷转化为芳香族化合物的转化率，这表明在反应速率和选择性方面的催化性质有所改善。比较硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物的结果需要查看每个系统提供的详细数据，包括特定的速率、选择性和由H/D交换和烷烃裂合研究揭示的机制。

Unfortunately, the provided document does not contain specific details about the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It focuses on the dehydrocyclodimerization of light alkanes on modified H-ZSM5 zeolites, including the role of metal cations and acid sites in these reactions. There are no references to zirconium hydrides or thorium hydrides, nor any information on their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis. 

Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested comparison and contrasts regarding the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions.

C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D2 into reaction products.

The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn.

Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites. Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2).

The mechanism in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involves the sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane aromatization turnover. This limits the rate and selectivity of the reaction on H-ZSM5. The initial dehydrogenation of propane to propene, rapid oligomerization-cracking of alkene intermediates, and the cyclization and aromatization of these alkenes into stable C6+ aromatics occur in parallel with acid-catalyzed and thermal cracking reactions to form methane and ethane.

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit comparable rates of C-H bond activation across the mentioned materials, albeit with enhanced rates of chemical conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuteration upon introduction of Ga and Zn cations. The formation of propene is notably faster on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, yet the C-H bond activation dynamics remain unaffected by the presence of these metals. The catalytic activity of Ga and Zn sites facilitates the recombination of hydrogen atoms derived from C-H bond cleavage, thereby accelerating propene formation and enhancing aromatic selectivity. Acid sites within the Brönsted framework are primarily responsible for C-H bond activation, with Ga and Zn cations enabling more efficient turnover of these sites without the necessity for hydrogen transfer or cracking reactions. This mechanism ensures the rapid and selective conversion of light alkanes into valuable products, such as aromatic compounds and hydrogen, by bypassing the formation of undesired by-products like methane and ethane.

在二氧化硅负载的锆化氢和氧化铝负载的钍化氢中，C-H键活化的速率在上述材料之间相当，但引入镓和锌离子后，化学转化、氢解离和从D2引入反应产物中的氘原子的速率增加。丙烯的形成在Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上显著更快，但C-H键活化速率对镓和锌的存在依赖性较弱。镓和锌位点通过促进酸位点的氢原子重新组合成全部氢（H2），加速丙烯的形成并提高芳烃的选择性。酸位点主要负责C-H键活化，而镓和锌位点使这些位点的周转更高效，无需氢转移或裂解反应。这种机制确保了轻烷基化合物快速、选择性地转化为有价值的产物，如芳香化合物和氢气，同时避免生成诸如甲烷和乙烷等副产品。
