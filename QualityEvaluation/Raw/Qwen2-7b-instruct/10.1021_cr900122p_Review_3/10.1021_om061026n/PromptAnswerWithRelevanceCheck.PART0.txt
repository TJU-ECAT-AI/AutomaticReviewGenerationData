Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

[1] "In papers with more than one author, the asterisk indicates the name of the author to whom inquiries about the paper should be addressed."
[2] "The intermediate shown in Scheme 5 is drawn incorrectly (extra carbon in the ring backbone) and should be as follows:"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The authors of the paper are F. Basuli, B. C. Bailey, L. A. Watson, J. Tomaszewski, J. C. Huffman, and D. J. Mindiola. Inquiry about the paper should be directed to the author marked with an asterisk. The intermediate depicted in Scheme 5 has an incorrect representation; it should be redrawn without the extra carbon in the ring backbone.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
论文作者包括F. Basuli、B. C. Bailey、L. A. Watson、J. Tomaszewski、J. C. Huffman和D. J. Mindiola。关于论文的问题应直接向标注有星号的作者提出。方案5中显示的中间体绘制不正确，应该去掉环骨架中的额外碳原子。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

The provided document does not contain information about the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, including details on their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, the requested comparison cannot be made based on the content provided.

[1] "Four-coordinate titanium alkylidene complexes have been synthesized and studied in relation to their reactivity and kinetic properties involving the terminal neopentylidene functionality."
[2] "The intermediate shown in Scheme 5 is drawn incorrectly (extra carbon in the ring backbone) and should be as follows:"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The synthesis and study of four-coordinate titanium alkylidene complexes have been conducted focusing on their reactivity and kinetic properties related to the terminal neopentylidene functionality. An error was identified in the depiction of an intermediate in Scheme 5, where an extra carbon atom was present in the ring backbone; the correct representation was provided.
