The synthesis and study of four-coordinate titanium alkylidene complexes have been conducted focusing on their reactivity and kinetic properties related to the terminal neopentylidene functionality. An error was identified in the depiction of an intermediate in Scheme 5, where an extra carbon atom was present in the ring backbone; the correct representation was provided.
