[1] "Complex la reacts in neat C6D6 to produce quantitatively (by NMR) the [1-2H] neopentyl L2H5] phenyl complex (C5H5)2 Ti(CHDCMe3)(C6D5) [2H6]-3a, with the selective incorporation of one deuterium on the neopentyl a-carbon."
[2] "In the presence of THF a product is formed concurrently that indicates at least one alternative reaction pathway for these unsaturated alkylidene intermediates."
[3] "The efficiency of this trapping is substrate-dependent, as can be seen from competition experiments with the ring-expansion reaction in the presence of THF."

The document describes the generation of reactive titanocene neopentylidene species capable of intermolecular addition of both sp2- and sp3-C-H bonds to the Ti=CHR double bond. These species are obtained from the reaction of dichlorides with Mg(CH2CMe3)2-dioxane in diethyl ether. The document also mentions the observation of intermolecular activation of benzylic sp3-CH bonds and aliphatic C-H bonds on titanocene alkylidene intermediates, with the efficiency of trapping being substrate-dependent.

文档描述了生成能够对Ti=CHR双键进行间分子添加的反应性钛碳双键二聚体物种，这些物种能够与sp2-和sp3-C-H键反应。这些物种通过二氯化物与Mg(CH2CMe3)2-二氧烷在二乙醚中的反应获得。文档还提到了对叔丁基、苯基等基团的sp3-C-H键的间分子激活，并指出捕获效率依赖于底物。
