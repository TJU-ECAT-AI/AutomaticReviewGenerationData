[1] "Recent investigations of the reactivity of metal-nonmetal multiple bonds have involved activation of hydrocarbon C-H bonds by di-metal imido species."
[2] "Intermolecular addition of a C-H bond to an M=NR functionality constitutes the microscopic reverse of α-elimination from metal-hydrocarbyl-amido complexes."
[3] "The bis-neopentyl complexes 1 are thus convenient precursors of titanocene alkylide species under mild conditions."
[4] "In solution at 20 °C, la has a half-life of 56 min, while this is only 20 min for the methylcyclopentadienyl derivative lb, showing that alkyl substitution on the cyclopentadienyl ligand facilitates the a-H abstraction process."
[5] "In the presence of THF a product is formed concurrently that indicates at least one alternative reaction pathway for these unsaturated alkylidene intermediates."
[6] "In conclusion, titanocene bis(neopenty1) complexes form convenient precursors of unsaturated alkylidene species that are able to effect intermolecular C-H activation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature describes the synthesis and characterization of titanocene bis(neopentyl) complexes, which serve as convenient precursors for the formation of unsaturated alkylidene species capable of intermolecular C-H activation. These complexes are generated under mild conditions, and their stability is influenced by alkyl substitution on the cyclopentadienyl ligand. The reaction pathways involve a-hydrogen abstraction and intermolecular addition of both sp2- and sp3-C-H bonds to the Ti=C double bond. The efficiency of trapping by C-H bonds is substrate-dependent, with competition experiments revealing different trapping efficiencies in various solvents. The mechanism of intermolecular C-H activation involves the activation of hydrocarbon C-H bonds by reactive titanocene neopentylidene intermediates, which contrasts with α-elimination reactions from metal-hydrocarbyl-amido complexes.

文献描述了钛酸二正戊基复合物的合成和表征，这些复合物作为生成不饱和烷基烯类物种的方便前体，能够实现分子间C-H活化。这些复合物在温和条件下生成，其稳定性受到环戊二烯基配体上烷基取代的影响。反应途径包括α-氢原子抽取和对sp2-和sp3-C-H键的分子间添加到Ti=C双键。C-H键的捕获效率依赖于底物，竞争实验揭示了不同溶剂中的捕获效率。分子间C-H激活的机制涉及通过活性钛酸二正戊基烯类中间体活化碳氢化合物C-H键，这与从金属-烃酰胺复合物的α消除反应形成对比。

The document describes the generation of reactive titanocene neopentylidene species capable of intermolecular addition of both sp2- and sp3-C-H bonds to the Ti=CHR double bond. These species are obtained from the reaction of dichlorides with Mg(CH2CMe3)2-dioxane in diethyl ether. The document also mentions the observation of intermolecular activation of benzylic sp3-CH bonds and aliphatic C-H bonds on titanocene alkylidene intermediates, with the efficiency of trapping being substrate-dependent.
