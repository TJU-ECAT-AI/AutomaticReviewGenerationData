The literature describes the synthesis and characterization of titanocene bis(neopentyl) complexes, which serve as convenient precursors for the formation of unsaturated alkylidene species capable of intermolecular C-H activation. These complexes are generated under mild conditions, and their stability is influenced by alkyl substitution on the cyclopentadienyl ligand. The reaction pathways involve a-hydrogen abstraction and intermolecular addition of both sp2- and sp3-C-H bonds to the Ti=C double bond. The efficiency of trapping by C-H bonds is substrate-dependent, with competition experiments revealing different trapping efficiencies in various solvents. The mechanism of intermolecular C-H activation involves the activation of hydrocarbon C-H bonds by reactive titanocene neopentylidene intermediates, which contrasts with α-elimination reactions from metal-hydrocarbyl-amido complexes.

文献描述了钛酸二正戊基复合物的合成和表征，这些复合物作为生成不饱和烷基烯类物种的方便前体，能够实现分子间C-H活化。这些复合物在温和条件下生成，其稳定性受到环戊二烯基配体上烷基取代的影响。反应途径包括α-氢原子抽取和对sp2-和sp3-C-H键的分子间添加到Ti=C双键。C-H键的捕获效率依赖于底物，竞争实验揭示了不同溶剂中的捕获效率。分子间C-H激活的机制涉及通过活性钛酸二正戊基烯类中间体活化碳氢化合物C-H键，这与从金属-烃酰胺复合物的α消除反应形成对比。
