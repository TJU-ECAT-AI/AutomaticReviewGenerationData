The study focuses on the detailed structural investigation of grafted complexes formed on partially dehydroxylated silica and alumina supports. The grafted complexes display high activity in alkane metathesis reactions. Structures of these complexes were explored using spectroscopic techniques. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides were prepared through a metal alkyl transfer process, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides were synthesized using an ion-exchange method. Notably, the silica-supported complexes exhibit better stability than their alumina counterparts. The mechanisms underlying H/D exchange involve σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis. In alkane metathesis, chain walking is identified as a significant process.

研究主要关注在部分脱水硅和氧化铝支持下接枝复合物的详细结构研究。这些接枝复合物在烷烃裂合反应中表现出高活性。通过光谱技术探索了这些复合物的结构。通过金属烷基转移过程制备了硅支持的锆化氢，而铝支持的钍化氢则是通过离子交换方法合成的。值得注意的是，硅支持的复合物比其铝支持的同系物具有更好的稳定性。H/D交换机制涉及σ键裂合和氢解离。在烷烃裂合中，链行走被识别为一个关键过程。
