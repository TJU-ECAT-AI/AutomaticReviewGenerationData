1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides were prepared by grafting [Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] onto partially dehydroxylated silica. These complexes demonstrated high activity in alkane metathesis, with improved reaction rates and selectivity compared to the base materials. The mechanism involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking.

2. No relevant quotes regarding alumina-supported thorium hydrides were found in the document.

1. 通过将[Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3]嫁接到部分脱羟基的硅上，制备了硅支持的锆化氢。这些复合物在烷烃裂合中表现出高活性，与基本材料相比，反应速率和选择性得到了改善。机制涉及σ键裂合、氢解离和链行走。

2. 文档中没有找到关于氧化铝支持的钍化氢的相关引用。
