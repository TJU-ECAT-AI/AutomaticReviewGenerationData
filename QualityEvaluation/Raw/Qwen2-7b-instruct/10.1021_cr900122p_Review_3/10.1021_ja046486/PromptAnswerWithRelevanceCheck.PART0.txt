The study focuses on the detailed structural investigation of grafted complexes formed on partially dehydroxylated silica and alumina supports. The grafted complexes display high activity in alkane metathesis reactions. Structures of these complexes were explored using spectroscopic techniques. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides were prepared through a metal alkyl transfer process, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides were synthesized using an ion-exchange method. Notably, the silica-supported complexes exhibit better stability than their alumina counterparts. The mechanisms underlying H/D exchange involve σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis. In alkane metathesis, chain walking is identified as a significant process.
