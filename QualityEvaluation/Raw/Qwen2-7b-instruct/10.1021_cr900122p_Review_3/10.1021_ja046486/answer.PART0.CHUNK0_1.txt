The study detailed structural investigations of the grafting of [Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] and [Cp*TaMe4] on silica partially dehydroxylated at 700°C. It determined the activity of the grafted complexes towards alkane metathesis and compared silica-supported zirconium hydrides with alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. Mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis were explored, along with the discussion of reaction rates, selectivity, and the involvement of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.
