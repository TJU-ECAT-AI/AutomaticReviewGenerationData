[1] "Cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) are dehydrogenated at <80 °C to the corresponding cycloalkenes by (Ar,P)2ReH,in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene."
[2] "There appears to be a general trend towards more efficient dehydrogenation with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride (1)."
[3] "Finely divided rhenium metal is very reactive and burns to the heptaoxide."
[4] "However, the yield of cyclo-octene (65 %) from cyclo-octane and (lb) was unaffected when the reaction was carried out in the presence of air."
[5] "It is interesting to note that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane stops at cyclohexene, whereas a reaction involving metallic rhenium would have been expected to lead to several steps."
[6] "We therefore believe that these dehydrogenations proceed essentially according to the mechanism outlined in Scheme 1, the key step (3 + 5) being the (reversible) oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a co-ordinatively unsaturated intermediate such as (3), followed by (reversible) p-elimination (5 --f 7)."

The study described in the document focuses on the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes using rhenium complexes, specifically the bisphosphine rhenium heptahydrides (1) in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene as a hydrogen acceptor. The process occurs under mild conditions, with higher yields observed when using heptahydrides with electron-releasing ligands. The dehydrogenation is believed to proceed through a mechanism involving oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a co-ordinatively unsaturated intermediate, followed by p-elimination. The study does not compare silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, nor does it detail their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis. It also does not discuss reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking in these processes.

本文研究的是环烷烃通过rhenium复合物，特别是七氢化磷二芳基rhenium（1）在3,3-二甲基丁烯存在下的脱氢作用。该过程在温和条件下进行，使用电子释放配体的七氢化物时观察到更高的产率。认为脱氢过程通过氧化加成的机制进行，环烷烃与一个协调不饱和中间体反应，随后进行p消除。研究没有比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物或氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的作用，也没有详细描述它们在H/D交换或烷烃裂解中的机制。它也不讨论反应速率、选择性或σ键重排、氢解离或链行走在这些过程中的角色。
