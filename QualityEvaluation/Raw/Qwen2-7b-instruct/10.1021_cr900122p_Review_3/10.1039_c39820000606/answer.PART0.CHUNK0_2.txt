[1] "Cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) are dehydrogenated at <80°C to the corresponding cycloalkenes by (Ar,P)2ReH,in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene."
[2] "There appears to be a general trend towards more efficient dehydrogenation with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride (1)."
[3] "Processes involving radicals (i.e., abstraction of H from the cycloalkane), or free metal particles (e.g., colloidal rhenium), do not seem to be responsible for these dehydrogenations."
[4] "The yields (by n.m.r.) of (6a), (6b), and (6c) were 10, 25, 2, and 45 %, respectively."
[5] "It is interesting to note that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane stops at cyclohexene, whereas a reaction involving metallic rhenium would have been expected to lead to several steps."

This study discusses the activation of C-H bonds in cycloalkanes by rhenium complexes. Specifically, cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) are dehydrogenated at temperatures below 80°C using (Ar,P)2ReH complexes in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene. There is an observed trend where more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride lead to more efficient dehydrogenation. Processes involving radicals or free metal particles are not found to be responsible for these dehydrogenations. The yields for the formation of cyclopentadienyl dihydrides (6a), (6b), and (6c) were 10%, 25%, 2%, and 45% respectively. Notably, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane halts at cyclohexene, suggesting that a reaction involving metallic rhenium would likely produce multiple products.

本文研究了rhenium复合物激活环烷烃中的C-H键。具体来说，使用(Ar,P)2ReH复合物和3,3-二甲基丁烯在低于80°C的温度下对CnH2n（n = 6, 7, 8）环烷烃进行脱氢反应。观察到随着七亚甲基中的电子释放配体数量增加，脱氢反应效率提高的趋势。未发现涉及自由基或自由金属颗粒的过程是导致这些脱氢反应的原因。形成环戊二烯二氢化物（6a）、（6b）和（6c）的产率分别为10%、25%、2%和45%。值得注意的是，环己烷的脱氢反应在环己烯停止，这表明使用金属rhenium的反应可能会产生多个产物。
