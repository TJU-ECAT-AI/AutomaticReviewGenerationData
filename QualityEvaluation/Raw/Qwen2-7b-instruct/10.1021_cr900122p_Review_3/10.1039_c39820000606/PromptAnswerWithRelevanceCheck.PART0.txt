[3] "Finely divided rhenium metal is very reactive and burns to the heptaoxide."
[4] "no bicyclohexyl, which would be expected in a reaction involving cyclohexyl radicals, could be detected in the reaction mixture from cyclohexane and (lb)."
[5] "These dehydrogenations proceed essentially according to the mechanism outlined in Scheme 1, the key step (3 + 5) being the (reversible) oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a co-ordinatively unsaturated intermediate such as (3), followed by (reversible) p-elimination (5 --f 7)."

The study discusses the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes using rhenium complexes. Cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) are dehydrogenated at temperatures below 80°C to form the corresponding cycloalkenes. The efficiency of the dehydrogenation process increases with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride. Rhenium metal, when finely divided, is highly reactive, burning to heptaoxide. However, no bicyclohexyl could be detected in the reaction mixture from cyclohexane and the heptahydride, suggesting that the reaction does not involve cyclohexyl radicals. The mechanism proposed for these dehydrogenations involves oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a coordinately unsaturated intermediate followed by reversible p-elimination.

研究讨论了使用铑复合物对环烷烃的脱氢作用。环烷烃CnH2n（n = 6，7，8）在低于80°C的温度下被脱氢形成相应的环烯烃。脱氢过程的效率随着七亚甲基中释放电子能力更强的配体而增加。当铑金属细分为时，其高度反应性，燃烧生成七氧化物。然而，在环己烷和七亚甲基的反应混合物中没有检测到双环己基，这表明反应不涉及环己基自由基。提出的机制涉及将环烷烃添加到共配合物不饱和中间体上进行氧化，随后是可逆的p消除。

This study reports the activation of C-H bonds in cycloalkanes by rhenium complexes under mild conditions. The rhenium complexes used are bisphosphine rhenium heptahydrides (1), and they react with 3,3-dimethylbutene as a hydrogen acceptor. The process leads to the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes to form cycloalkenes.

本文研究的是环烷烃通过rhenium复合物，特别是七氢化磷二芳基rhenium（1）在3,3-二甲基丁烯存在下的脱氢作用。该过程在温和条件下进行，使用电子释放配体的七氢化物时观察到更高的产率。认为脱氢过程通过氧化加成的机制进行，环烷烃与一个协调不饱和中间体反应，随后进行p消除。研究没有比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物或氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的作用，也没有详细描述它们在H/D交换或烷烃裂解中的机制。它也不讨论反应速率、选择性或σ键重排、氢解离或链行走在这些过程中的角色。

The process leads to the formation of cycloalkenes. It is observed that the efficiency of dehydrogenation increases with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride. The yields of cyclopentadienyl dihydrides (6a,6b,6c) range from 10% to 45%. The reaction mechanism involves oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a coordinatively unsaturated intermediate, followed by p-elimination. The study suggests that the dehydrogenation stops at cyclohexene, deviating from the expected outcome with metallic rhenium, which typically leads to multiple steps in the reaction sequence.
