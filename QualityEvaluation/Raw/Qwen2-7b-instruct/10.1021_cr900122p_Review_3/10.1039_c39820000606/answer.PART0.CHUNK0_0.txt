[1] "Cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) are dehydrogenated at <80 °C to the corresponding cycloalkenes by (Ar,P)2ReH,in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene."
[2] "There appears to be a general trend towards more efficient dehydrogenation with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride (1)."
[3] "Finely divided rhenium metal is very reactive and burns to the heptaoxide."
[4] "no bicyclohexyl, which would be expected in a reaction involving cyclohexyl radicals, could be detected in the reaction mixture from cyclohexane and (lb)."
[5] "These dehydrogenations proceed essentially according to the mechanism outlined in Scheme 1, the key step (3 + 5) being the (reversible) oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a co-ordinatively unsaturated intermediate such as (3), followed by (reversible) p-elimination (5 --f 7)."

The study discusses the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes using rhenium complexes. Cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) are dehydrogenated at temperatures below 80°C to form the corresponding cycloalkenes. The efficiency of the dehydrogenation process increases with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride. Rhenium metal, when finely divided, is highly reactive, burning to heptaoxide. However, no bicyclohexyl could be detected in the reaction mixture from cyclohexane and the heptahydride, suggesting that the reaction does not involve cyclohexyl radicals. The mechanism proposed for these dehydrogenations involves oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a coordinately unsaturated intermediate followed by reversible p-elimination.

研究讨论了使用铑复合物对环烷烃的脱氢作用。环烷烃CnH2n（n = 6，7，8）在低于80°C的温度下被脱氢形成相应的环烯烃。脱氢过程的效率随着七亚甲基中释放电子能力更强的配体而增加。当铑金属细分为时，其高度反应性，燃烧生成七氧化物。然而，在环己烷和七亚甲基的反应混合物中没有检测到双环己基，这表明反应不涉及环己基自由基。提出的机制涉及将环烷烃添加到共配合物不饱和中间体上进行氧化，随后是可逆的p消除。
