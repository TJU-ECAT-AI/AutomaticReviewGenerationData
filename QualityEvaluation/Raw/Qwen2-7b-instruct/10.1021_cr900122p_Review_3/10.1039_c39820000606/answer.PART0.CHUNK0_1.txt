<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This study reports the activation of C-H bonds in cycloalkanes by rhenium complexes under mild conditions. The rhenium complexes used are bisphosphine rhenium heptahydrides (1), and they react with 3,3-dimethylbutene as a hydrogen acceptor. The process leads to the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes to form cycloalkenes.

这项研究报道了在温和条件下，rhenium配合物激活环烷烃中的C-H键。使用的rhenium配合物是bisphosphine rhenium heptahydrides（1），它们与3,3-二甲基丁烯作为氢接受体反应。该过程导致环烷烃脱氢形成环烯烃。

Similarly, after heating at 80 C for 1 h, cycloheptane gave cycloheptene (30%), and cyclo-octane gave cyclo-octene (65 %).
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
When heated at 80°C for one hour, cycloheptane produced cycloheptene with a 30% yield, while cyclo-octane resulted in cyclo-octene with a 65% yield.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
当加热至80°C一小时后，cycloheptane生成了30%的cycloheptene，而cyclo-octane生成了65%的cyclo-octene。

<quotes>
There appears to be a general trend towards more efficient dehydrogenation with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride (1).
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There seems to be a general trend indicating that dehydrogenation becomes more efficient with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride (1).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
存在一种普遍趋势，表明在heptahydride（1）中，随着释放电子的配体数量增加，脱氢作用变得更加有效。

<quotes>
Processes involving radicals (i.e., abstraction of H from the cycloalkane), or free metal particles (e.g., colloidal rhenium),do not seem to be responsible for these dehydrogenations.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Radical processes, including hydrogen abstraction from the cycloalkane, or free metal particles such as colloidal rhenium, do not appear to be responsible for these dehydrogenations.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
涉及自由基的过程，包括从环烷烃中抽象氢，或如胶态rhenium这样的自由金属颗粒，并不被认为是这些脱氢作用的原因。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
It is interesting to note that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane stops at cyclohexene,whereas a reaction involving metallic rhenium would have been expected to lead to
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Notably, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane halts at cyclohexene, whereas a reaction involving metallic rhenium might have led to further stages.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
值得注意的是，环己烷的脱氢作用在环己烯处停止，而涉及金属rhenium的反应本应导致后续阶段。

<quotes>
Finely divided rhenium metal is very reactive and burns to the heptaoxide;e the yield of cjrclo-octene (65 %) from cyclo- octane and (lb) was unaffected, however, when the reaction was carried out in the presence of air, and cyclo-octene was still formed (30% yield) even when pure oxygen was bubbled through the mixture during the reaction.
</quotes>

Fine rhenium metal is highly reactive and combusts to heptaoxide. However, the yield of cyclo-octene from cyclo-octane and (lb) remained unchanged when the reaction was conducted in air, and cyclo-octene was still produced (30% yield) even when pure oxygen was bubbled through the mixture during the reaction.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
细粒度的rhenium金属非常活泼并燃烧成heptaoxide。然而，在空气中进行反应时，cyclo-octane和(lb)产生的cyclo-octene的产率未受影响，并且即使在反应过程中通过混合物吹入纯氧，仍然产生了cyclo-octene（30%产率）。
