Cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) are dehydrogenated at <80
"C
to the corresponding cycloalkenes by (Ar,P)2ReH,in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene.

There appears to be a general trend towards more efficient dehydrogenation with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride (1).

The yields (by n.m.r.) of (6a),$ (6b),4 and (6c)S were 10,25,2 and 45 %, respectively.

The organometallic component of the reaction mixture, which is soluble in acetone and dichloro- methane, has not yet been characterised.

The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane stops at cyclohexene,whereas a reaction involving metallic rhenium would have been expected to lead to several steps

We thank the Compagnie des MCtaux PrCcieux for a generous loan of rhenium.

This study reports on the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes (n = 6, 7, 8) by rhenium complexes (Ar,P)2ReH under mild conditions in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene. The process leads to the formation of cycloalkenes. It is observed that the efficiency of dehydrogenation increases with more electron-releasing ligands in the heptahydride. The yields of cyclopentadienyl dihydrides (6a,6b,6c) range from 10% to 45%. The reaction mechanism involves oxidative addition of the cycloalkane to a coordinatively unsaturated intermediate, followed by p-elimination. The study suggests that the dehydrogenation stops at cyclohexene, deviating from the expected outcome with metallic rhenium, which typically leads to multiple steps in the reaction sequence.

这项研究报道了在存在3,3-二甲基丁烯的情况下，由Ar,P)2ReH制备的rhenium复合物在温和条件下对环烷烃（n=6,7,8）的脱氢反应。该过程导致环烯烃的形成。观察到脱氢效率随着七氢化物中电子释放配体的增加而提高。cyclopentadienyl dihydrides（6a,6b,6c）的产率范围从10%到45%。反应机制涉及环烷烃与配合物中的协调性不饱和中间体的氧化添加，随后是p-消除。研究表明，脱氢反应在环己烯停止，偏离了使用金属rhenium时通常预期的多个步骤反应序列的结果。
