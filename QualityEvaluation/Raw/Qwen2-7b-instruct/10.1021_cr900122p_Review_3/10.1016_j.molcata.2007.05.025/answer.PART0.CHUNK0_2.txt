The study investigates the adsorption of methane, ethane, and pentane on the -alumina (110C) surface using semi-empirical (PM3) cluster calculations. For methane, the most favorable reaction involves the abstraction of an H atom forming a CO bond. For ethane and pentane, the abstraction of two H atoms results in the formation of an alkene being the most favorable reaction. The surface Al atoms facilitate these reactions but do not participate directly in bond formation. The energy barriers for these reactions vary depending on the hydrogenation degree of the models used, with barriers around 60-70 kcal/mol on one model and 26-37 kcal/mol on another.

该研究使用半经验（PM3）簇计算方法，探讨了甲烷、乙烷和戊烷在-氧化铝（110C）表面的吸附作用。对于甲烷，最有利的反应是脱去一个H原子并形成CO键。对于乙烷和戊烷，脱去两个H原子形成烯烃是最有利的反应。表面Al原子促进这些反应，但不直接参与形成化学键。这些反应的能量壁垒取决于所使用的模型的氢化程度，其中一种模型的能量壁垒约为60-70 kcal/mol，另一种约为26-37 kcal/mol。
