[1] "It is found that the abstraction of an H atom accompanied by the formation of a CO bond is the most favorable reaction for methane on the alumina surface."
[2] "For ethane and pentane-alumina interactions, the abstraction of two H atoms accompanied by the formation of an alkene is the most favorable reaction."
[3] "On both models, the most energetically favorable first reaction step for methane is H abstraction from the carbon (C1) position, with C1 bonding to a surface oxygen."
[4] "Under certain conditions these reactions can be exothermic. The lowest energy barriers to these reactions are around 60-70 kcal/mol on H8Al40O64 model and around 26-37 kcal/mol on Al48O72 model."

The document investigates the adsorption of methane, ethane, and pentane on the alumina (110C) surface using semi-empirical (PM3) cluster calculations. It finds that for methane, the abstraction of an H atom followed by the formation of a CO bond is the most favorable reaction. For ethane and pentane, the abstraction of two H atoms leads to the formation of an alkene, which is considered the most favorable reaction. On both models studied, the most energetically favorable initial step for methane involves H abstraction from the carbon (C1) position, with the C1 bonding to a surface oxygen atom. These reactions can be exothermic under specific conditions, with the lowest energy barriers being approximately 60-70 kcal/mol on one model and around 26-37 kcal/mol on another model.

本文利用半经验（PM3）簇计算研究了甲烷、乙烷和戊烷在氧化铝（110C）表面的吸附。它发现，对于甲烷，脱氢并形成CO键是其最有利的反应。对于乙烷和戊烷，脱去两个H原子生成烯烃被认为是最佳反应。在所研究的两种模型中，甲烷最有利的第一步反应涉及从碳（C1）位置脱去H原子，C1与表面氧原子结合。这些反应在特定条件下可以放热，最低的能量壁垒约为60-70 kcal/mol在一个模型上和大约26-37 kcal/mol在另一个模型上。
