[1] "The interpretation of H/D exchange between surface OH- groups of a metal oxide and CD4 as an indication of strong Br onsted acidity [14] was questioned by Engelhardt et al. [5,6], who proposed an alternative explanation that H/D exchange could be initiated by dissociative methane chemisorption over Lewis acid-Lewis base pair sites."
[2] "Such chemisorption would produce the surface species CD3 and D+, with the CD3 moiety bound to a valence unsaturated Al atom of Lewis acid character."
[3] "Previously we applied theoretical calculations to gain insight into the interaction of 1-hexene with -alumina, and found the interaction to be purely repulsive at valence unsaturated surface Al sites [14]."
[4] "By contrast, investigations of the interactions of simple alcohols with -alumina showed participation of the surface Lewis acid sites [15]."
[5] "On both models, the most energetically favorable first reaction step for methane is H abstraction from the carbon (C1) position, with C1 bonding to a surface oxygen."
[6] "For ethane and pentane, the most energetically favorable first reaction step is the dehydrogenation of two H atoms from different carbon atoms."
[7] "In pentane-alumina interactions, the two H atoms are abstracted from C2 and C3, respectively, producing 2-pentene."
[8] "The lowest energy barriers to these reactions are around 60-70 kcal/mol on H8Al40O64 model and around 26-37 kcal/mol on Al48O72 model."

This study focuses on the interactions of methane, ethane, and pentane with the (110C) surface of -alumina. The research uses semi-empirical cluster calculations to analyze the adsorption processes. For methane, the most favorable reaction involves the abstraction of an H atom accompanied by the formation of a CO bond. In contrast, for ethane and pentane, the most favorable reactions involve the abstraction of two H atoms leading to the formation of an alkene. The surface aluminum atoms facilitate these reactions but do not directly participate in the bond formation. The energy barriers for these reactions range from approximately 60-70 kcal/mol to around 26-37 kcal/mol depending on the model used.

本研究主要关注甲烷、乙烷和戊烷与α-氧化铝(110C)表面的相互作用。使用半经验性簇集计算方法来分析吸附过程。对于甲烷，最有利的反应是脱氢并形成CO键。相反，对于乙烷和戊烷，最有利的反应是脱去两个氢原子形成烯烃。表面的铝原子促进了这些反应，但并未直接参与键的形成。这些反应的能量壁垒在大约60-70 kcal/mol到约26-37 kcal/mol之间，具体取决于所使用的模型。
