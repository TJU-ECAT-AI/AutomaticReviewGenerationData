The study investigates the adsorption of methane, ethane, and pentane on the (-alumina)110C surface through semi-empirical PM3 cluster calculations. The key findings indicate that methane reacts via abstraction of an H atom leading to a CO bond formation, while for ethane and pentane, the most favorable reaction involves the abstraction of two H atoms resulting in an alkene formation. Surface aluminum atoms facilitate these reactions without being directly involved in the bond formation. This contrasts with the interactions of simple alcohols with (-alumina), which demonstrate participation of the surface Lewis acid sites.

该研究通过半经验的PM3簇计算，探讨了甲烷、乙烷和戊烷在(-氧化铝)110C表面的吸附。主要发现显示，甲烷通过脱氢形成CO键的反应最有利；而对于乙烷和戊烷与(-氧化铝)的相互作用，则是通过脱去两个氢原子并形成烯烃来实现。表面的铝原子促进了这些反应的发生，但并未直接参与键的形成。这与简单醇类物质与(-氧化铝)的相互作用有所不同，后者显示出表面Lewis酸位点的参与。

The document investigates the adsorption of methane, ethane, and pentane on the alumina (110C) surface using semi-empirical (PM3) cluster calculations. It finds that for methane, the abstraction of an H atom followed by the formation of a CO bond is the most favorable reaction. For ethane and pentane, the abstraction of two H atoms leads to the formation of an alkene, which is considered the most favorable reaction. On both models studied, the most energetically favorable initial step for methane involves H abstraction from the carbon (C1) position, with the C1 bonding to a surface oxygen atom. These reactions can be exothermic under specific conditions, with the lowest energy barriers being approximately 60-70 kcal/mol on one model and around 26-37 kcal/mol on another model.

本文利用半经验（PM3）簇计算研究了甲烷、乙烷和戊烷在氧化铝（110C）表面的吸附。它发现，对于甲烷，脱氢并形成CO键是其最有利的反应。对于乙烷和戊烷，脱去两个H原子生成烯烃被认为是最佳反应。在所研究的两种模型中，甲烷最有利的第一步反应涉及从碳（C1）位置脱去H原子，C1与表面氧原子结合。这些反应在特定条件下可以放热，最低的能量壁垒约为60-70 kcal/mol在一个模型上和大约26-37 kcal/mol在另一个模型上。

[1] "The interpretation of H/D exchange between surface OH- groups of a metal oxide and CD4 as an indication of strong Br onsted acidity [14] was questioned by Engelhardt et al. [5,6], who proposed an alternative explanation that H/D exchange could be initiated by dissociative methane chemisorption over Lewis acid-Lewis base pair sites."
[2] "Such chemisorption would produce the surface species CD3 and D+, with the CD3 moiety bound to a valence unsaturated Al atom of Lewis acid character."

[6] "For ethane and pentane, the most energetically favorable first reaction step is the dehydrogenation of two H atoms from different carbon atoms."
[7] "In pentane-alumina interactions, the two H atoms are abstracted from C2 and C3, respectively, producing 2-pentene."

This study focuses on the interactions of methane, ethane, and pentane with the (110C) surface of -alumina. The research uses semi-empirical cluster calculations to analyze the adsorption processes. For methane, the most favorable reaction involves the abstraction of an H atom accompanied by the formation of a CO bond. In contrast, for ethane and pentane, the most favorable reactions involve the abstraction of two H atoms leading to the formation of an alkene. The surface aluminum atoms facilitate these reactions but do not directly participate in the bond formation. The energy barriers for these reactions range from approximately 60-70 kcal/mol to around 26-37 kcal/mol depending on the model used.

1. The study investigates the adsorption of methane, ethane, and pentane on -alumina (110C) surfaces using semi-empirical (PM3) cluster calculations. The most favorable reaction for methane involves the abstraction of an H atom forming a CO bond. For ethane and pentane, the most favorable reaction includes the abstraction of two H atoms leading to the formation of an alkene.

2. The surface aluminum atoms facilitate the reactions, although they do not participate directly in the bond formation. This indicates that the surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the interactions of these hydrocarbons with the alumina surface.

3. The research findings highlight the importance of understanding the specific mechanisms governing the interactions between hydrocarbons and -alumina surfaces, which can inform the development of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

4. The study provides insights into the role of surface Al sites in promoting chemisorption reactions, such as H abstraction, which can lead to the formation of CO bonds in methane and alkenes in ethane and pentane reactions. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of surface chemistry and catalysis.
