1. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides and silica-supported zirconium hydrides both activate C-H bonds in alkane hydrogenolysis reactions. However, alumina-supported thorium hydrides can cleave the carbon-carbon (CC) bond of ethane, while silica-supported zirconium hydrides cannot.

2. The mechanism for the formation of the zirconium hydrides involves opening siloxane bridges and creating bonds between zirconium and silicon, as well as hydrogen.

3. In the case of the alumina-supported thorium hydrides, they can cleave the CC bond of ethane due to a different mechanism compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides, which are unable to cleave the CC bond of ethane.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct characteristics and mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. 

1. **Preparation and Structure**: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are synthesized by grafting tetraneopentylzirconium complex onto partially dehydroxylated silica followed by hydrogen treatment. The alumina-supported thorium hydrides are prepared through impregnation of thorium(VII) oxide on alumina. These materials show well-defined structures due to the SOMC approach, which allows for precise control over composition and distribution of active sites.

2. **Catalytic Properties**:
   - **H/D Exchange**: Zirconium hydrides catalyze the H/D exchange in alkanes via a -alkyl transfer mechanism. This contrasts with the mechanism proposed for group 4 catalysts, indicating unique reactivity patterns.
   - **Alkane Metathesis**: The silica-supported thorium hydrides exhibit a specific activity where they catalytically hydrogenolyze ethane into methane, demonstrating a different mechanism compared to group 4 catalysts. This suggests the involvement of a four-centered -bond metathesis transition state, oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway, or carbenic mechanism in the metathesis process.

3. **Reaction Rates and Selectivity**: The silica-supported zirconium hydrides show high catalytic performance in polyethylene depolymerization, while the silica-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate activity in alkane hydrogenolysis. The silica-supported thorium hydride also acts as a catalyst in alkane metathesis, transforming an alkane into its higher and lower homologues, with the presence of a concurrent unproductive reaction (scrambling) during the process.

4. **Mechanism Insights**: The mechanisms underlying these reactions involve a combination of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The detailed mechanisms are elucidated through the characterization of the catalysts, providing insights into the active sites' electronic configurations, coordination environments, and reaction intermediates.

5. **Comparison**: The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ significantly in their mechanisms of action, selectivity, and the types of reactions they catalyze. Zirconium hydrides are effective in H/D exchange and polyethylene depolymerization, while thorium hydrides are active in alkane hydrogenolysis and alkane metathesis, showcasing distinct reactivity profiles.

[1] "The well-defined silica-supported zirconium monohydride (as the major species) and dihydride species [(SiO)3ZrH and (SiO)2ZrH2] have been synthesised and characterized thanks to recent spectroscopic developments. These supported catalysts have been found to be very active in the polyethylene depolymerisation reaction."
[2] "The catalyst system able to achieve such kind of reaction should therefore be able to polymerise olefins. We chose a silica or silica alumina zirconium hydride-supported species,which were good candidates to fulfil these requirements (in- sertion of olefins [5461], alkane hydrogenolysis [6264])."
[3] "As the olefin polymerisation is thermodynamically very favoured at moderate temperature, the reverse reaction of depolymerisation is really disfavoured at low or moderate temperatures. Therefore, the depolymerisation of poly- olefins is a very challenging goal!"
[4] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride, [(SiO)2TaH], and the silica-supported zirconium hydrides [(SiO)2ZrH2] and [(SiO)3ZrH] both catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes but with a major difference between the two metalstantalum hydride is able to cleave the CC bond of ethane whereas zirconium hydrides are not."
[5] "The well-defined tantalum hydride disiloxy-species 5 has been consecutively obtained by treatment of 4 under hydro- gen at 150 C (see Scheme 9) [73] and has been character- ized by IR and NMR spectroscopies."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides were synthesized and characterized for their depolymerization of polyethylene, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides were utilized for alkane hydrogenolysis. Both processes involve the insertion of olefins and hydrogenolysis of alkanes. However, they differ significantly in their mechanisms and applications. In depolymerization, zirconium hydrides undergo a -alkyl transfer mechanism, whereas in hydrogenolysis, they follow a different pathway. Thorium hydrides, on the other hand, show distinct activity in alkane hydrogenolysis compared to group 4 catalysts, indicating a unique mechanism for CC bond cleavage. The silica-supported tantalum hydride species 5 demonstrates capability for alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis, with the latter involving potential four-centered transition states or oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathways.

[1] "As the group 4 transition metal catalysts, it catalyses this reaction, but shows a particular activity: it catalytically hydrogenolyzes ethane into methane."
[2] "This unproductive reaction has a rate which is ca. five times faster than the productive metathesis reaction."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high catalytic activity in alkane hydrogenolysis, converting ethane into methane at 150°C. This process involves a unique mechanism that differs from group 4 catalysts, which typically produce methane/ethane mixtures. Additionally, they facilitate alkane metathesis, transforming an alkane into its higher and lower homologues. However, an unproductive process occurs concurrently, which is the scrambling of ethane, happening approximately five times faster than the productive metathesis reaction. A possible mechanism for CC bond cleavage in alkane hydrogenolysis involves a four-centred bond metathesis transition state, oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway, or carbenic mechanism, as depicted in Scheme 11.
