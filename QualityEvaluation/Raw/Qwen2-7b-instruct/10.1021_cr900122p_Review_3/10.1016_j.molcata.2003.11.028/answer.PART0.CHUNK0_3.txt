[1] "The well-defined silica-supported zirconium monohydride (as the major species) and dihydride species [(SiO)3ZrH and (SiO)2ZrH2] have been synthesised and characterized thanks to recent spectroscopic developments. These supported catalysts have been found to be very active in the polyethylene depolymerisation reaction."
[2] "The catalyst system able to achieve such kind of reaction should therefore be able to polymerise olefins. We chose a silica or silica alumina zirconium hydride-supported species,which were good candidates to fulfil these requirements (in- sertion of olefins [5461], alkane hydrogenolysis [6264])."
[3] "As the olefin polymerisation is thermodynamically very favoured at moderate temperature, the reverse reaction of depolymerisation is really disfavoured at low or moderate temperatures. Therefore, the depolymerisation of poly- olefins is a very challenging goal!"
[4] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride, [(SiO)2TaH], and the silica-supported zirconium hydrides [(SiO)2ZrH2] and [(SiO)3ZrH] both catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes but with a major difference between the two metalstantalum hydride is able to cleave the CC bond of ethane whereas zirconium hydrides are not."
[5] "The well-defined tantalum hydride disiloxy-species 5 has been consecutively obtained by treatment of 4 under hydro- gen at 150 C (see Scheme 9) [73] and has been character- ized by IR and NMR spectroscopies."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides were synthesized and characterized for their depolymerization of polyethylene, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides were utilized for alkane hydrogenolysis. Both processes involve the insertion of olefins and hydrogenolysis of alkanes. However, they differ significantly in their mechanisms and applications. In depolymerization, zirconium hydrides undergo a -alkyl transfer mechanism, whereas in hydrogenolysis, they follow a different pathway. Thorium hydrides, on the other hand, show distinct activity in alkane hydrogenolysis compared to group 4 catalysts, indicating a unique mechanism for CC bond cleavage. The silica-supported tantalum hydride species 5 demonstrates capability for alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis, with the latter involving potential four-centered transition states or oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathways.

硅基支持的锆氢化物被合成并表征用于聚乙烯降解，而氧化铝基支持的钍氢化物则用于烷烃氢解。这两种过程都涉及烯烃插入和烷烃氢解，但其机制和应用存在显著差异。在降解过程中，锆氢化物通过-烷基转移机制进行，而在氢解过程中，则遵循不同的途径。与第4组催化剂相比，钍氢化物在烷烃氢解中的活性表现出独特性，表明CC键断裂存在独特的机制。硅基支持的钽氢化物物种5显示出对烷烃氢解和重排的能力，其中重排过程可能涉及四中心过渡态或氧化加成/还原消除途径。
