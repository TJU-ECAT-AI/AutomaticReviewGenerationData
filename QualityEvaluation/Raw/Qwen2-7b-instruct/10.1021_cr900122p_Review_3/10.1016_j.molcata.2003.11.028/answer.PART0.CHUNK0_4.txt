[1] "As the group 4 transition metal catalysts, it catalyses this reaction, but shows a particular activity: it catalytically hydrogenolyzes ethane into methane."
[2] "This unproductive reaction has a rate which is ca. five times faster than the productive metathesis reaction."
[3] "A specific mechanism of CC bond cleavage and formation can be suggested such as a four centred -bond metathesis transition state, an oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway or a carbenic mechanism (see Scheme 11)."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high catalytic activity in alkane hydrogenolysis, converting ethane into methane at 150°C. This process involves a unique mechanism that differs from group 4 catalysts, which typically produce methane/ethane mixtures. Additionally, they facilitate alkane metathesis, transforming an alkane into its higher and lower homologues. However, an unproductive process occurs concurrently, which is the scrambling of ethane, happening approximately five times faster than the productive metathesis reaction. A possible mechanism for CC bond cleavage in alkane hydrogenolysis involves a four-centred bond metathesis transition state, oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway, or carbenic mechanism, as depicted in Scheme 11.

硅基载钛酸盐催化剂在烷烃氢解反应中表现出高催化活性，能够将乙烷转化为甲烷，在150°C下进行。这一过程涉及一种与第4组过渡金属催化剂不同的独特机制，后者通常产生甲烷/乙烷混合物。此外，它们还促进烷烃互换反应，将一个烷烃转化为其更高的和更低的同系物。然而，同时存在一个无产生成本的过程，即乙烷的混乱，其速率约为产生活性反应的五倍。CC键断裂的可能机制涉及四中心键互换过渡态、氧化添加/还原消除途径或碳烯机制，如方案11所示。
