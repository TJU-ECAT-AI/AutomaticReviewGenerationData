[1] "The silica-supported rhenium carbene species [(SiO)Re(C-t-Bu)(=CH-t-Bu)(CH2-t-Bu)] has been tested in the propene metathesis reaction. Its catalytic activity has been found to be high at moderate temperatures (initial T.O.F. = 0.25 mol/mol Re/s)."
[2] "The silicaalumina-supported zirconium hydride [(SiO)3ZrH] has been found to be very active in the polyethylene depolymerisation reaction."
[3] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] is active in the alkane hydrogenolysis reaction."
[4] "The catalyst system able to achieve such kind of reaction should therefore be able to polymerise olefins."
[5] "The silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica followed by a treatment under hydrogen."
[6] "The well-defined tantalum hydride disiloxy-species 5 has been consecutively obtained by treatment of 4 under hydrogen at 150 C."
