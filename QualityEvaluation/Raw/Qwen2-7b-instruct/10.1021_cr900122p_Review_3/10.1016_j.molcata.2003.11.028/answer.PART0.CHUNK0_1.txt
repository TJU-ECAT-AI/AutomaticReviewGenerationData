[1] "The well-defined silica-supported zirconium hydride, [(SiO)2ZrH], and the silica-supported zirconium hydrides [(SiO)2ZrH2] and [(SiO)3ZrH] both catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes but with a major difference between the two metalstantalum hydride is able to cleave the CC bond of ethane whereas zirconium hydrides are not."
[2] "This silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst has also been found to be active in the alkane metathesis reaction."
[3] "The mechanism of the formation of the zirconium hydrides (see Scheme 6(b)), which involves opening the siloxane bridges and formation of (ZrOSi) and (SiH) bonds close to each other."
[4] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride species converts alkanes including ethane into methane at 150 C, this rules out the -methyl transfer as the unique CC bond cleavage mechanism in the case of tantalum."
[5] "In contrast with these group 4 catalysts, the tantalum-supported species produces only methane as final product independently from the nature of the linear or branched initial alkane."

1. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides and silica-supported zirconium hydrides both activate C-H bonds in alkane hydrogenolysis reactions. However, alumina-supported thorium hydrides can cleave the carbon-carbon (CC) bond of ethane, while silica-supported zirconium hydrides cannot. These zirconium hydrides are also active in alkane metathesis reactions.

2. The mechanism for the formation of the zirconium hydrides involves opening siloxane bridges and creating bonds between zirconium and silicon, as well as hydrogen.

3. In the case of the alumina-supported thorium hydrides, they can cleave the CC bond of ethane due to a different mechanism compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides, which are unable to cleave the CC bond of ethane.

4. The silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst is active in alkane hydrogenolysis, producing methane from alkanes at 150°C, unlike the group 4 metal hydrides that produce methane/ethane mixtures.

5. The silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst exclusively produces methane, regardless of the nature of the initial alkane, unlike the group 4 metal hydrides that produce methane/ethane mixtures.

1. 硅酸支持的钍氢化物和硅酸支持的锆氢化物都能催化烷烃的氢解反应，激活C-H键。然而，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物可以断裂乙烷中的碳-碳（CC）键，而硅酸支持的锆氢化物不能。这些锆氢化物在烷烃互换反应中也表现出活性。

2. 形成锆氢化物的机制涉及打开硅氧烷桥，并在锆和硅之间以及氢原子之间形成键。

3. 对于氧化铝支持的钍氢化物而言，它们能够由于不同的机制断裂乙烷中的CC键，与硅酸支持的锆氢化物不同，后者无法断裂乙烷中的CC键。

4. 硅酸支持的钽氢化物催化剂在150°C下对烷烃进行氢解反应，产生甲烷，而不同于第四组过渡金属氢化物，后者产生甲烷/乙烷混合物。

5. 硅酸支持的钽氢化物催化剂仅产生甲烷，无论初始烷烃的性质如何，而第四组过渡金属氢化物会产生甲烷/乙烷混合物。
