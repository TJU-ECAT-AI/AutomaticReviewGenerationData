[1] "In the field of classical organometallic chemistry, numerous complexes of transition metals of Groups 3-5, lanthanides and actinides have been reported to activate the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes and aromatics."
[2] "These highly electrophilic complexes with a do configuration are commonly believed to activate the C-H bond of alkanes by a cr-bond metathesis mechanism."
[3] "We have therefore tried to see if other silica-supported early transition metal hydrides could lead to similar types of C-H bond activation, one of the objectives being a possible functionalisation after activation."
[4] "We report here that a silica-supported tantalum-hydride is also able to activate cyclooctane and methane to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species."
[5] "When 2a and 2b are treated under hydrogen (1 atm; 150 °C for 15 h), supported tantalum-hydride [Ta]s-H3 is formed."
[6] "Complex 3 exchanges reversibly with deuterium at room temperature as evidenced by the reversible shift under D2 and then H2 of the three IR bands at 1815, 1830 and 1855 cm-1."
[7] "Complex 3 reacts with water to liberate hydrogen and with Me1 to form CH4."
[8] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species."
[9] "To our knowledge, this is the first example of an intermolecular alkane activation on a supported tantalum hydride."
[10] "In the case of supported tantalum-hydride [Ta]s-H3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation."

1. The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in terms of their ability to activate C-H bonds. Zirconium hydrides are effective in activating both methane and higher alkanes through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism. In contrast, thorium hydrides exhibit different activation mechanisms and possibly different structures. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides have been found to be highly electrophilic, facilitating the activation of alkanes. However, the specific details of alumina-supported thorium hydrides' structure and mechanism are not provided in the literature.

2. The catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides involve the activation of C-H bonds through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism, leading to the formation of zirconium alkyls. These alkyls can then undergo further reactions, such as oxidation with molecular oxygen, to produce zirconium alkoxides, which react with acetic acid to yield alkyl acetates. The rate of these reactions depends on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalyst. The selectivity of the process is high, as evidenced by the specific products formed.

3. The mechanism for alkane metathesis in silica-supported zirconium hydrides involves a rearrangement of the alkane's carbon atoms, facilitated by the electrophilic nature of the zirconium center. The presence of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes allows for the selective transformation of alkanes into various alkyl derivatives. The rate of alkane metathesis increases with temperature, and the presence of certain substituents on the alkane can influence the reaction pathway and product distribution.

4. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides show differences in their catalytic properties and mechanisms. The former are capable of activating C-H bonds through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism, while the latter may utilize distinct mechanisms based on the properties of thorium and alumina. Both materials can facilitate the formation of alkyl derivatives, but the specifics of their structures, reactivity, and selectivity differ, influenced by factors such as the type of hydride, support material, and reaction conditions.

1. 硅基载锆化氢和氧化铝基载钍化氢在C-H键激活方面的制备、结构和催化性质有所不同。锆化氢能够有效地激活甲烷和高碳烷烃，并通过cr-键移位机制进行。相比之下，钍化氢的具体激活机制和结构可能不同。硅基载锆化氢因其高度电子亲性而被发现能够促进烷烃的激活。然而，铝基载钍化氢的具体结构和机制信息未在文献中提供。

2. 硅基载锆化氢的催化性质涉及通过cr-键移位机制激活C-H键，导致形成锆烷基。这些烷基随后可以进一步反应，如在分子氧的存在下进行氧化，生成锆醇，然后与乙酸反应以产生相应的烷基乙酸酯。这些反应的速度取决于温度、压力以及催化剂等因素。产物的选择性很高，体现在特定产物的形成上。

3. 硅基载锆化氢中烷基化的机制涉及烷烃碳原子的重排，得益于锆中心的电子亲性。σ-键移位、氢解和链行走等过程允许对烷烃进行选择性转化，形成各种烷基衍生物。随着温度的增加，烷基化反应速度增加，并且烷基上的某些取代基可以影响反应路径和产物分布。

4. 硅基载锆化氢和氧化铝基载钍化氢在催化性质和机制方面显示出差异。前者能够通过cr-键移位机制激活C-H键，而后者可能基于钍和氧化铝的特性采用不同的机制。两者都能促进烷基衍生物的形成，但它们的具体结构、活性和选择性受到诸如氢化物类型、支持材料和反应条件等因素的影响。
