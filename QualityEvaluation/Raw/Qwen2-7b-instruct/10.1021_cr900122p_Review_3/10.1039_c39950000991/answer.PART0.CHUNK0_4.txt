1. The silica-supported tantalum hydride complex 3 forms two surface species upon reaction with silanol groups of dehydroxylated silica, leading to liberation of neopentane. It reversibly exchanges with deuterium at room temperature, indicating its reactivity. Complex 3 reacts with water to release hydrogen and with Me1 to produce CH4. It spontaneously reacts with cyclooctane, forming a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex. The intensity of certain infrared bands decreases, and molecular hydrogen is produced, as confirmed by GC analysis. The reaction with ButNCO results in the evolution of CO2 and an expected supported imido-tantalum complex. Complex 3 also reacts with CD4, forming a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species under 100-150 "C conditions.

2. The mechanism for C-H bond activation by silica-supported tantalum hydride involves direct grafting of tantalum onto silica, leading to the formation of Si-O-Ta bonds, which make the tantalum very electrophilic. The isolated metallic centers and stabilization of highly coordinately unsaturated species contribute to the enhanced reactivity compared to molecular complexes. The subsequent oxidation step facilitates selective introduction of an oxygen atom into the alkane molecule.

3. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit differences in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides have been reported to activate C-H and C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4, respectively, forming corresponding surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed under molecular oxygen into the corresponding tantalum-alkoxy derivatives, which yield alkylacetates with acetic acid. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides have not been extensively discussed in this literature. The mechanisms for C-H bond activation involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, but specific details regarding these processes are not provided for alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

1. 3号硅支持钽氢化合物与去羟基化硅的硅醇基团反应，形成两种表面物种：约为65%的SiO-Ta(-CH2- CTV%)(=CH-CM)2a和约为35%的(zSi0)2Ta(-CH2- CMe3)(=CH-CMe3)2b，并释放出正戊烷。它在室温下可逆地与氘交换，表明其反应性。3号化合物与水反应释放氢气，并与Me1生成CH4。它在室温下自发与环癸烷蒸汽反应，形成一个钽环癸基表面复合物。某些红外谱带的强度降低，产生分子氢，这由GC分析证实。与ButNCO的反应导致CO2的释放和预期的受支持的酰基钽复合物。3号化合物也与CD4反应，在100-150 "C条件下形成一个钽-二甲基-脱氘基甲基物种。

2. 钽氢化合物硅支持的表面活性对于C-H键激活涉及直接将钽固定到硅上，形成Si-O-Ta键，使钽非常亲电。孤立的金属中心和高度配位不饱和物种的稳定化导致与分子复合物相比，提高了反应性。后续的氧化步骤允许选择性地向烷烃分子中引入氧原子。

3. 硅支持锆氢化合物和氧化铝支持钍氢化合物在准备、结构和催化性质方面表现出差异。硅支持锆氢化合物已报告能够激活环癸烷和CD4的C-H和C-D键，分别形成相应的表面复合物。这些复合物可以被分子氧气转化为对应的钽醇衍生物，进一步生成烷基乙酸酯。另一方面，氧化铝支持钍氢化合物在本文文献中未详细讨论。C-H键激活的机制涉及σ键互换、氢解离和链行走，但关于这些过程的具体细节并未提供给氧化铝支持钍氢化合物。
