1. The preparation of silica-supported tantalum hydride involves reacting the trisneopentyl(neopenty1idene)tantalum complex with silanol groups of dehydroxylated silica, leading to the formation of surface species 2a and 2b, which release neopentane upon treatment with hydrogen. 
2. Under hydrogen treatment, the supported tantalum-hydride forms with an IR band at 1830 cm-1 and shoulders at 1815 and 1855 cm-1.
3. Reversible exchange with deuterium at room temperature is demonstrated by the reversible shift of IR bands at 1815, 1830, and 1855 cm-1 under D2 and then H2.
4. The reaction of complex 3 with ButNCO results in the evolution of CO2 and an expected supported imido-tantalum complex, with an elemental analysis showing a 0.97 N : Ta ratio.
5. Complex 3 reacts with CD4 at 100-150 "C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species.

1. 制备二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物，通过将三叔戊基（叔戊基）tantalum复合物与脱羟基化的二氧化硅上的硅醇基团反应，产生表面物种2a和2b，这些物种在氢处理下释放出叔戊烷。
2. 在氢处理下，形成的支持钽氢化物具有1830 cm-1的IR带以及1815和1855 cm-1的肩峰。
3. 在室温下，通过D2和随后的H2的可逆变化来证实了与氘的可逆交换，IR带在1815、1830和1855 cm-1处发生可逆变化。
4. 复合物3与ButNCO反应产生CO2和预期的支撑酰基钽复合物，元素分析显示N：Ta比为0.97。
5. 复合物3在100-150 "C与CD4反应形成钽-二氘甲基物种。
