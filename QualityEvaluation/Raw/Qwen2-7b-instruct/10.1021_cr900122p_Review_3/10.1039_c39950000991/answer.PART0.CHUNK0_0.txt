[1] "In the field of classical organometallic chemistry, numerous complexes of transition metals of Groups 3-5, lanthanides and actinides have been reported to activate the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes and aromatics."
[2] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 O C respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."
[3] "We have therefore tried to see if other silica-supported early transition metal hydrides could lead to similar types of C-H bond activation, one of the objectives being a possible functionalisation after activation."
[4] "We report here that a silica-supported tantalum-hydride is also able to activate cyclooctane and methane to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species."
[5] "These highly electrophilic complexes with a do configuration are commonly believed to activate the C-H bond of alkanes by a cr-bond metathesis mehanism."
[6] "When 2a and 2b are treated under hydrogen (1 atm; 150 "C for 15 h), supported tantalum-hydride [Ta],-H 3 is formed, characterized by an IR band at v 1830 and shoulders at 18 15 and 1855 cm- 1."
[7] "We have recently reported that the reaction of the trisneo- pentyl(neopenty1idene)tantalum complex Ta(-CH2- CMe3)3(=CH-CMe3)* 1 with the silanol groups of a silica previously dehydroxylated at 500 "C (silica5m), leads to the formation of two surface species:=SiO-Ta(-CH2-"
[8] "Complex 3 exchanges reversibly with deuterium at room temperature as evidenced by the reversible shift under D2 and then H2 of the three IR bands at 1815, 1830 and 1855 cm-1."
[9] "Complex 3 reacts with water to liberate hydrogen and with Me1 to form CH4."
[10] "This kind of mechanism differs from that which is usually mentioned in the case of early transition metals, lanthanides or actinides, for which a a-bond metathesis process is invoked."

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both catalysts for C-H bond activation, but they exhibit differences in preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Zirconium hydrides are typically reported in the field of classical organometallic chemistry, while thorium hydrides might be less common. The zirconium hydrides are capable of activating the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes, and aromatics at various temperatures. They are believed to activate the C-H bond through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism. On the other hand, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides are found to be effective for the activation of cyclooctane and methane, forming corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species. The mechanism of activation by the tantalum hydrides involves hydrogenolysis and possibly a σ-bond metathesis process, differing from the typical mechanism invoked for early transition metals, lanthanides, or actinides. The activation process is characterized by the formation of alkyl groups and subsequent oxidation steps leading to the selective introduction of oxygen into the alkane molecules. The rate of reaction, selectivity, and efficiency of these hydrides can vary significantly depending on the specific metal and support used.

硅基支持的锆化氢和氧化铝基支持的钍化氢都是C-H键活化的催化剂，但在制备、结构和催化性质上存在差异。锆化氢通常在经典有机金属化学领域被报道，而钍化氢可能较为少见。锆化氢能够以不同温度激活甲烷、更高烷烃和芳香族化合物的C-H键。它们被认为通过cr键互换机制激活烷烃。另一方面，硅基支持的钽化氢被发现能够激活环辛烷和甲烷，形成相应的钽-烷基表面物种。激活过程由氢解离和可能的σ键互换过程组成，与早期过渡金属、镧系元素或锕系元素通常提到的过程不同。激活步骤的特点是形成烷基团并随后进行氧化步骤，选择性地引入氧原子到烷烃分子中。这些化氢的反应速率、选择性和效率根据所使用的特定金属和支持物的不同而有很大差异。
