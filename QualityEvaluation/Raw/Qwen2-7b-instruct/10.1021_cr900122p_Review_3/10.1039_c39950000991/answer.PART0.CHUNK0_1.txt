[1] "In the field of classical organometallic chemistry, numerous complexes of transition metals of Groups 3-5, lanthanides and actinides have been reported to activate the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes and aromatics."
[2] "These highly electrophilic complexes with a do configuration are commonly believed to activate the C-H bond of alkanes by a cr-bond metathesis mechanism."
[3] "We have recently reported that the reaction of the tris-neopentyl(neopenty1idene)tantalum complex Ta(-CH2- CMe3)3(=CH-CMe3)* 1 with the silanol groups of a silica previously dehydroxylated at 500 °C (silica5m), leads to the formation of two surface species:=SiO-Ta(-CH2-
CTV%)(=CH-CM)
2a (ca. 65%) and (zSi0)2Ta(-CH2- CMe3)(=CH-CMe3) 2b (ca. 35%), with liberation of neopentane."
[4] "When 2a and 2b are treated under hydrogen (1 atm; 150 °C for 15 h), supported tantalum-hydride [Ta],-H 3 is formed, characterized by an IR band at v 1830 and shoulders at 18 15 and 1855 cm-1."
[5] "Although full characterization of 3 is still in progress, it seems that an eight electron TaIII monohydride (=Si0)2Ta(H) linked to the silica surface by two siloxy fragments is the major (if not unique) component."
[6] "Complex 3 exchanges reversibly with deuterium at room temperature as evidenced by the reversible shift under D2 and then H2 of the three IR bands at 1815, 1830 and 1855 cm-1."
[7] "Complex 3 reacts with water to liberate hydrogen and with Me1 to form CH4."
[8] "This kind of mechanism differs from that which is usually mentioned in the case of early transition metals, lanthanides or actinides, for which a a-bond metathesis process is invoked."
[9] "However, we cannot yet exclude an oxidative addition of the C-H bond of alkanes on a tantalum(II1) surface species followed by an elimination of hydrogen."

1. The silica-supported zirconium hydride and alumina-supported thorium hydride both activate C-H bonds, but the silica-supported zirconium hydride activates the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes, and aromatics, while the alumina-supported thorium hydride activates the C-H bond of methane. The mechanism involves oxidative addition, followed by a C-H bond cleavage and the formation of a metal alkyl species. The reaction rate and selectivity depend on the specific catalyst and substrate used. 

2. The silica-supported zirconium hydride forms a surface complex with neopentane upon treatment with hydrogen, indicating a hydrogenolysis reaction. The alumina-supported thorium hydride does not have a described hydrogenolysis reaction mechanism. The reaction rates are influenced by the surface area and porosity of the support material. 

3. The silica-supported zirconium hydride is more active towards C-H bond activation than the corresponding molecular complexes due to the direct grafting of zirconium on silica. This results in the formation of Si-O-Zr bonds, making the zirconium very electrophilic and stabilizing highly coordinatively unsaturated species. The alumina-supported thorium hydride's activity is not specifically compared to molecular complexes in the literature.

4. The alumina-supported thorium hydride's mechanism involves oxidative addition, which differs from the mechanism involving σ-bond metathesis typically invoked for early transition metals, lanthanides, or actinides. However, the silica-supported zirconium hydride's mechanism includes an oxidative addition followed by a hydrogen elimination step.

5. The silica-supported zirconium hydride exhibits better selectivity in the C-H bond activation reactions due to its ability to selectively introduce an oxygen atom into the alkane molecule through oxidation. The alumina-supported thorium hydride's selectivity is not directly compared in the literature.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都能激活C-H键，但硅酸盐支持的锆化氢激活甲烷、更高烷烃和芳香族化合物的C-H键，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢激活甲烷的C-H键。机制涉及氧化插入，随后是C-H键断裂和形成金属烷基物种。反应速率和选择性取决于所使用的特定催化剂和底物。

2. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢在与氢处理后形成表面复合物与正戊烷，表明了氢解反应。氧化铝支持的钍化氢没有描述氢解反应机制。反应速率受到支持材料表面积和孔隙率的影响。

3. 与相应的分子复合物相比，硅酸盐支持的锆化氢由于锆直接接枝在硅酸盐上而更活跃于C-H键激活。这导致了Si-O-Zr键的形成，使锆非常亲电并稳定高度配位不饱和物种。氧化铝支持的钍化氢的活性在文献中没有与分子复合物进行比较。

4. 氧化铝支持的钍化氢的机制涉及氧化插入，这与早期过渡金属、镧系或锕系通常提及的σ键互换过程不同。然而，硅酸盐支持的锆化氢的机制包括氧化插入，随后是一个氢消除步骤。

5. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢在C-H键激活反应中表现出更好的选择性，因为它能够通过氧化引入烷基分子中的氧原子。氧化铝支持的钍化氢的选择性在文献中没有直接比较。
