The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both catalysts for C-H bond activation, but they exhibit differences in preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Zirconium hydrides are typically reported in the field of classical organometallic chemistry, while thorium hydrides might be less common. The zirconium hydrides are capable of activating the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes, and aromatics at various temperatures. They are believed to activate the C-H bond through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism. On the other hand, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides are found to be effective for the activation of cyclooctane and methane, forming corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface species. The mechanism of activation by the tantalum hydrides involves hydrogenolysis and possibly a σ-bond metathesis process, differing from the typical mechanism invoked for early transition metals, lanthanides, or actinides. The activation process is characterized by the formation of alkyl groups and subsequent oxidation steps leading to the selective introduction of oxygen into the alkane molecules. The rate of reaction, selectivity, and efficiency of these hydrides can vary significantly depending on the specific metal and support used.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The silica-supported zirconium hydride and alumina-supported thorium hydride both activate C-H bonds, but the silica-supported zirconium hydride activates the C-H bond of methane, higher alkanes, and aromatics, while the alumina-supported thorium hydride activates the C-H bond of methane. The mechanism involves oxidative addition, followed by a C-H bond cleavage and the formation of a metal alkyl species. The reaction rate and selectivity depend on the specific catalyst and substrate used. 

2. The silica-supported zirconium hydride forms a surface complex with neopentane upon treatment with hydrogen, indicating a hydrogenolysis reaction. The alumina-supported thorium hydride does not have a described hydrogenolysis reaction mechanism. The reaction rates are influenced by the surface area and porosity of the support material. 

3. The silica-supported zirconium hydride is more active towards C-H bond activation than the corresponding molecular complexes due to the direct grafting of zirconium on silica. This results in the formation of Si-O-Zr bonds, making the zirconium very electrophilic and stabilizing highly coordinatively unsaturated species. The alumina-supported thorium hydride's activity is not specifically compared to molecular complexes in the literature.

4. The alumina-supported thorium hydride's mechanism involves oxidative addition, which differs from the mechanism involving σ-bond metathesis typically invoked for early transition metals, lanthanides, or actinides. However, the silica-supported zirconium hydride's mechanism includes an oxidative addition followed by a hydrogen elimination step.

5. The silica-supported zirconium hydride exhibits better selectivity in the C-H bond activation reactions due to its ability to selectively introduce an oxygen atom into the alkane molecule through oxidation. The alumina-supported thorium hydride's selectivity is not directly compared in the literature.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都能激活C-H键，但硅酸盐支持的锆化氢激活甲烷、更高烷烃和芳香族化合物的C-H键，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢激活甲烷的C-H键。机制涉及氧化插入，随后是C-H键断裂和形成金属烷基物种。反应速率和选择性取决于所使用的特定催化剂和底物。

2. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢在与氢处理后形成表面复合物与正戊烷，表明了氢解反应。氧化铝支持的钍化氢没有描述氢解反应机制。反应速率受到支持材料表面积和孔隙率的影响。

3. 与相应的分子复合物相比，硅酸盐支持的锆化氢由于锆直接接枝在硅酸盐上而更活跃于C-H键激活。这导致了Si-O-Zr键的形成，使锆非常亲电并稳定高度配位不饱和物种。氧化铝支持的钍化氢的活性在文献中没有与分子复合物进行比较。

4. 氧化铝支持的钍化氢的机制涉及氧化插入，这与早期过渡金属、镧系或锕系通常提及的σ键互换过程不同。然而，硅酸盐支持的锆化氢的机制包括氧化插入，随后是一个氢消除步骤。

5. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢在C-H键激活反应中表现出更好的选择性，因为它能够通过氧化引入烷基分子中的氧原子。氧化铝支持的钍化氢的选择性在文献中没有直接比较。

1. The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in terms of their ability to activate C-H bonds. Zirconium hydrides are effective in activating both methane and higher alkanes through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism. In contrast, thorium hydrides exhibit different activation mechanisms and possibly different structures. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides have been found to be highly electrophilic, facilitating the activation of alkanes. However, the specific details of alumina-supported thorium hydrides' structure and mechanism are not provided in the literature.

2. The catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides involve the activation of C-H bonds through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism, leading to the formation of zirconium alkyls. These alkyls can then undergo further reactions, such as oxidation with molecular oxygen, to produce zirconium alkoxides, which react with acetic acid to yield alkyl acetates. The rate of these reactions depends on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalyst. The selectivity of the process is high, as evidenced by the specific products formed.

3. The mechanism for alkane metathesis in silica-supported zirconium hydrides involves a rearrangement of the alkane's carbon atoms, facilitated by the electrophilic nature of the zirconium center. The presence of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes allows for the selective transformation of alkanes into various alkyl derivatives. The rate of alkane metathesis increases with temperature, and the presence of certain substituents on the alkane can influence the reaction pathway and product distribution.

4. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides show differences in their catalytic properties and mechanisms. The former are capable of activating C-H bonds through a cr-bond metathesis mechanism, while the latter may utilize distinct mechanisms based on the properties of thorium and alumina. Both materials can facilitate the formation of alkyl derivatives, but the specifics of their structures, reactivity, and selectivity differ, influenced by factors such as the type of hydride, support material, and reaction conditions.

1. 硅基载锆化氢和氧化铝基载钍化氢在C-H键激活方面的制备、结构和催化性质有所不同。锆化氢能够有效地激活甲烷和高碳烷烃，并通过cr-键移位机制进行。相比之下，钍化氢的具体激活机制和结构可能不同。硅基载锆化氢因其高度电子亲性而被发现能够促进烷烃的激活。然而，铝基载钍化氢的具体结构和机制信息未在文献中提供。

2. 硅基载锆化氢的催化性质涉及通过cr-键移位机制激活C-H键，导致形成锆烷基。这些烷基随后可以进一步反应，如在分子氧的存在下进行氧化，生成锆醇，然后与乙酸反应以产生相应的烷基乙酸酯。这些反应的速度取决于温度、压力以及催化剂等因素。产物的选择性很高，体现在特定产物的形成上。

3. 硅基载锆化氢中烷基化的机制涉及烷烃碳原子的重排，得益于锆中心的电子亲性。σ-键移位、氢解和链行走等过程允许对烷烃进行选择性转化，形成各种烷基衍生物。随着温度的增加，烷基化反应速度增加，并且烷基上的某些取代基可以影响反应路径和产物分布。

4. 硅基载锆化氢和氧化铝基载钍化氢在催化性质和机制方面显示出差异。前者能够通过cr-键移位机制激活C-H键，而后者可能基于钍和氧化铝的特性采用不同的机制。两者都能促进烷基衍生物的形成，但它们的具体结构、活性和选择性受到诸如氢化物类型、支持材料和反应条件等因素的影响。

1. The silica-supported tantalum hydride complex 3 forms two surface species upon reaction with silanol groups of dehydroxylated silica, leading to liberation of neopentane. It reversibly exchanges with deuterium at room temperature, indicating its reactivity. Complex 3 reacts with water to release hydrogen and with Me1 to produce CH4. It spontaneously reacts with cyclooctane, forming a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex. The intensity of certain infrared bands decreases, and molecular hydrogen is produced, as confirmed by GC analysis. The reaction with ButNCO results in the evolution of CO2 and an expected supported imido-tantalum complex. Complex 3 also reacts with CD4, forming a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species under 100-150 "C conditions.

2. The mechanism for C-H bond activation by silica-supported tantalum hydride involves direct grafting of tantalum onto silica, leading to the formation of Si-O-Ta bonds, which make the tantalum very electrophilic. The isolated metallic centers and stabilization of highly coordinately unsaturated species contribute to the enhanced reactivity compared to molecular complexes. The subsequent oxidation step facilitates selective introduction of an oxygen atom into the alkane molecule.

3. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit differences in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides have been reported to activate C-H and C-D bonds of cyclooctane and CD4, respectively, forming corresponding surface complexes. These complexes can be transformed under molecular oxygen into the corresponding tantalum-alkoxy derivatives, which yield alkylacetates with acetic acid. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides have not been extensively discussed in this literature. The mechanisms for C-H bond activation involve σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, but specific details regarding these processes are not provided for alumina-supported thorium hydrides.
