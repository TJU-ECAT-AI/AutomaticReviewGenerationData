[1] "We previously reported that tetraneopentylchromium(IV) reacts with the hydroxyl groups of amorphous silica (partially dehydroxylated by thermal treatment in vacuo at 200 C) to give a bis(neopentyl)chromium(IV) surface complex."
[2] "The maximum loading of 1 on Aerosil-200 corresponds to 2.0% Cr by mass or 0.40 mmol Cr/g silica."
[3] "During a subsequent study of the thermal stability of 1, we discovered a reaction which produces a long-lived Cr(IV) neopentylidene complex."
[4] "Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4 (90% α-D2, 10% α-H2) was synthesized by reaction of BrMgCD2C(CH3)3 with CrCl3(THF)3."
[5] "When either 2 or 4 were exposed to 20 Torr ethylene at room temperature, we observed immediate ethylene polymerization."

Silica-supported chromium complexes were synthesized and characterized in this study. Tetraneopentylchromium(IV) reacted with silica's hydroxyl groups to produce a surface complex. The maximum chromium loading on Aerosil-200 reached 2.0% by mass or 0.40 mmol Cr/g silica. Further studies revealed a long-lived Cr(IV) neopentylidene complex. By labeling neopentyl ligands with deuterium, researchers synthesized Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4. These complexes were active in polymerizing ethylene at room temperature upon exposure to ethylene gas.

The silica-supported chromium complexes described in the literature are utilized in commercial processes for the polymerization of α-olefins, especially ethylene. These complexes are unique because they are high-valent chromium alkylidenes, a class of compounds that are rarely found in molecular chemistry. One such complex, Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4, was synthesized by reacting bromomagnesium neopentyl chloride with trichloro(triethoxy)chromium. This compound, when subjected to silica, resulted in the formation of (SiO)2Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)2. This process led to the liberation of neopentane-d2 (90%) and neopentane-d0 (10%). Furthermore, when either complex 2 or 4 was exposed to 20 Torr ethylene at room temperature, it initiated immediate ethylene polymerization.

文献中描述的硅酸盐支持的铬复合物在商业过程中用于α-烯烃的聚合，特别是乙烷。这些复合物的独特之处在于它们是高价铬烷基二烯，这类化合物在分子化学中很少见。其中一个复合物Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4通过将溴化镁-neopentyl氯与三氯化三乙氧基铬反应合成。此化合物在硅酸盐上作用后形成(SiO)2Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)2。这一过程导致释放出90%的去甲基戊烷-d2和10%的去甲基戊烷-d0。此外，当复合物2或4暴露于20托尔特的乙烷并在室温下时，它立即引发乙烷聚合。

The synthesis and characterization of silica-stabilized chromium(IV) alkylidene complexes are discussed in the provided literature. These complexes exhibit reactivity towards olefin insertion into a preformed CrC σ-bond, leading to ethylene polymerization. The complexes are prepared through the reaction of tetraneopentylchromium(IV) with partially dehydroxylated amorphous silica, resulting in the formation of a surface complex. Upon heating, neopentyl ligands are liberated, forming a new surface chromium species. The complexes are further characterized through reactions with halogen gases, indicating the presence of an alkylidene structure. Exposure to ethylene results in immediate polymerization, demonstrating the catalytic properties of these complexes in olefin insertion reactions.
