[1] "We previously reported that tetraneopentylchromium(IV) reacts with the hydroxyl groups of amorphous silica (partially dehydroxylated by thermal treatment in vacuo at 200 C) to give a bis(neopentyl)chromium(IV) surface complex."
[2] "The maximum loading of 1 on Aerosil-200 corresponds to 2.0% Cr by mass or 0.40 mmol Cr/g silica."
[3] "During a subsequent study of the thermal stability of 1, we discovered a reaction which produces a long-lived Cr(IV) neopentylidene complex."
[4] "Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4 (90% α-D2, 10% α-H2) was synthesized by reaction of BrMgCD2C(CH3)3 with CrCl3(THF)3."
[5] "When either 2 or 4 were exposed to 20 Torr ethylene at room temperature, we observed immediate ethylene polymerization."

Silica-supported chromium complexes were synthesized and characterized in this study. Tetraneopentylchromium(IV) reacted with silica's hydroxyl groups to produce a surface complex. The maximum chromium loading on Aerosil-200 reached 2.0% by mass or 0.40 mmol Cr/g silica. Further studies revealed a long-lived Cr(IV) neopentylidene complex. By labeling neopentyl ligands with deuterium, researchers synthesized Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4. These complexes were active in polymerizing ethylene at room temperature upon exposure to ethylene gas.

在本研究中，合成并表征了硅酸盐支持的铬复合物。四正戊基四价铬与硅胶的羟基反应生成表面复合物。在200°C真空条件下部分脱水后，最大铬负载达到2.0%质量或每克硅胶0.40毫摩尔Cr。进一步的研究发现了一个长寿命的四价Cr-正戊基烯丙基复合物。通过将正戊基配体标记为氘，研究人员合成了Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4。这些复合物在室温下暴露于乙烷气体时能够立即聚合乙烯。
