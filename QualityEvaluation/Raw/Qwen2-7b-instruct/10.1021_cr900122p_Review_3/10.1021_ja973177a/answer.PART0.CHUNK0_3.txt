The silica-supported chromium complexes described in the literature are utilized in commercial processes for the polymerization of α-olefins, especially ethylene. These complexes are unique because they are high-valent chromium alkylidenes, a class of compounds that are rarely found in molecular chemistry. One such complex, Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4, was synthesized by reacting bromomagnesium neopentyl chloride with trichloro(triethoxy)chromium. This compound, when subjected to silica, resulted in the formation of (SiO)2Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)2. This process led to the liberation of neopentane-d2 (90%) and neopentane-d0 (10%). Furthermore, when either complex 2 or 4 was exposed to 20 Torr ethylene at room temperature, it initiated immediate ethylene polymerization.

文献中描述的硅酸盐支持的铬复合物在商业过程中用于α-烯烃的聚合，特别是乙烷。这些复合物的独特之处在于它们是高价铬烷基二烯，这类化合物在分子化学中很少见。其中一个复合物Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)4通过将溴化镁-neopentyl氯与三氯化三乙氧基铬反应合成。此化合物在硅酸盐上作用后形成(SiO)2Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)2。这一过程导致释放出90%的去甲基戊烷-d2和10%的去甲基戊烷-d0。此外，当复合物2或4暴露于20托尔特的乙烷并在室温下时，它立即引发乙烷聚合。
