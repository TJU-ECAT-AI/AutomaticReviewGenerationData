[1] "Oxide-supported Cr catalysts are used in commercial processes to polymerize α-olefins, particularly ethylene."
[2] "We previously reported that tetraneopentylchromium(IV) reacts with the hydroxyl groups of amorphous silica (partially dehydroxylated by thermal treatment in vacuo at 200 C) to give a bis(neopentyl)chromium(IV) surface complex, 1, eq 1.6"
[3] "Upon heating 1 in vacuum (ca. 10-4 Torr) at 70 C for 4 h, (0.92  0.04) neopentyl ligands per Cr (average of nine experiments) were liberated as neopentane, and a new surface Cr species, 2, was formed."
[4] "The reaction of this compound with silica gave (SiO)2Cr(CD2C(CH3)3)2, with two ν(CD) vibrations at 2163 and 2103 cm-1, and was accompanied by the liberation of neopentane-d2 (90%) and neopentane-d0 (10%)."
[5] "When either 2 or 4 were exposed to 20 Torr ethylene at room temperature, we observed immediate ethylene polymerization."

The synthesis and characterization of silica-stabilized chromium(IV) alkylidene complexes are discussed in the provided literature. These complexes exhibit reactivity towards olefin insertion into a preformed CrC σ-bond, leading to ethylene polymerization. The complexes are prepared through the reaction of tetraneopentylchromium(IV) with partially dehydroxylated amorphous silica, resulting in the formation of a surface complex. Upon heating, neopentyl ligands are liberated, forming a new surface chromium species. The complexes are further characterized through reactions with halogen gases, indicating the presence of an alkylidene structure. Exposure to ethylene results in immediate polymerization, demonstrating the catalytic properties of these complexes in olefin insertion reactions.

本文讨论了用于合成和表征二氧化硅稳定化的四价铬烷基双键复合物。这些复合物表现出将烯烃插入预形成的CrC σ键的反应性，导致乙烯聚合。通过四丁基铬（IV）与部分脱水的二氧化硅的反应制备表面复合物。加热后，释放出正戊基配体，形成新的表面铬物种。通过与卤素气体的反应进一步表征了这些复合物，表明存在烷基双键结构。暴露于乙烯后立即发生聚合，显示了这些复合物在烯烃插入反应中的催化性质。
