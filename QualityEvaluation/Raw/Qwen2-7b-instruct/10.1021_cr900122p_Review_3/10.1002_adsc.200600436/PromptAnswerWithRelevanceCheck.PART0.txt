<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The silica-alumina-supported tungsten-based catalyst system was prepared through impregnation of tungsten compounds onto a support material. This system exhibits characteristics similar to both silica- and alumina-supported systems, depending on the specific conditions and compositions. Its catalytic properties, including activity and stability, were assessed under different experimental conditions. The catalyst demonstrated varying reaction rates, selectivities, and the involvement of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking mechanisms in alkane metathesis and C-H bond activation reactions.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were compared in terms of their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties for C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported catalyst demonstrated higher reactivity in H/D exchange reactions, while the alumina-supported catalyst showed better selectivity in alkane metathesis. Both mechanisms involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Reaction rates were faster for the silica-supported catalyst, and selectivity was higher for the alumina-supported catalyst.
