Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides were compared in terms of their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties for C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported catalyst demonstrated higher reactivity in H/D exchange reactions, while the alumina-supported catalyst showed better selectivity in alkane metathesis. Both mechanisms involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Reaction rates were faster for the silica-supported catalyst, and selectivity was higher for the alumina-supported catalyst.

对于C-H键活化反应，对二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢进行了比较。在H/D交换反应中，二氧化硅支持的催化剂显示出更高的反应活性，而氧化铝支持的催化剂在烷烃互变异构中表现出更好的选择性。两种机制都涉及σ键互变异构、氢解离和链行走。反应速率更快的是二氧化硅支持的催化剂，而选择性更高的是氧化铝支持的催化剂。
