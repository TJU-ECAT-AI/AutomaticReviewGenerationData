Since the provided literature does not contain specific details about the comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in terms of their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, it is impossible to provide detailed answers to the questions listed. Therefore, no relevant quotes or answers can be given based on the current information available in the document.
