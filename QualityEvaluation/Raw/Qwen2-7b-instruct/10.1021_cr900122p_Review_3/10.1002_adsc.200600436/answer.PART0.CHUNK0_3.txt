The silica-alumina-supported tungsten-based catalyst system was prepared through impregnation of tungsten compounds onto a support material. This system exhibits characteristics similar to both silica- and alumina-supported systems, depending on the specific conditions and compositions. Its catalytic properties, including activity and stability, were assessed under different experimental conditions. The catalyst demonstrated varying reaction rates, selectivities, and the involvement of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking mechanisms in alkane metathesis and C-H bond activation reactions.
