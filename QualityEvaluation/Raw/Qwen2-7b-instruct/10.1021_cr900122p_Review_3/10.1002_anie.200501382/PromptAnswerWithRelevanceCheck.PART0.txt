[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."
[3] "The improvement of activity on changing from Ta in 2 to W in 1 and the product selectivity show that olefin metathesis is probably the key process in CC bond formation in the alkane metathesis reaction."
[4] "Tungsten hydride 3 has an overall turnover number of 120 mol propane mol, which is much higher than that of the best known Ta system, that is, tantalum hydrides supported on silica or alumina."
[5] "These data corroborate what we observed and proposed earlier: alkane metathesis proceeds via carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates."

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity and selectivity in alkane metathesis, selectively forming ethane and butanes from propane. This is attributed to the olefin metathesis mechanism being the key process in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides display significantly higher activity and turnover numbers in alkane metathesis compared to the best-known zirconium hydrides. The improved catalytic performance of thorium hydrides is believed to arise from the enhanced reactivity and stability of thorium-based intermediates, such as carbenes and metallacyclobutanes, involved in alkane metathesis. The higher selectivity for linear over branched alkanes in thorium-based catalysts is consistent with the proposed model of alkane metathesis, where 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes favor the formation of higher homologues over less reactive 1,2-disubstituted carbenes.

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质存在差异。硅基锆化物在烷烃裂合中表现出高活性和选择性，能够从丙烷选择性地形成乙烷和丁烷。这归因于烯烃裂合机制是烷烃裂合中形成碳-碳键的关键过程。另一方面，氧化铝基钍化物在烷烃裂合中的活性和周转数显著高于已知的最佳锆化物。钍基催化剂的增强催化性能可能是由于钍基中间体（如卡宾和金属环丁烷）的反应性和稳定性增强所致。钍基催化剂对线性化合物的选择性高于支链化合物，与烷烃裂合提出的模型一致，其中1,3-二取代金属环丁烷有利于形成更高同系物，而非更不活跃的1,2-二取代卡宾。

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides, such as [(SiO)2TaH], have demonstrated the ability to selectively transform alkanes into their higher and lower homologues, yielding ethane and butanes from propane, among others. The mechanism involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, specifically [(SiO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]PDA, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity in alkane metathesis compared to their tantalum counterparts. This improvement in activity is likely due to the intrinsic properties of tungsten, which plays a central role in olefin metathesis. The structure of these tungsten hydrides on alumina is characterized by isolated tungsten atoms grafted to the surface through covalent bonds, which facilitates the formation of final species involving reactions with aluminum species. The catalytic properties highlight a preference for linear alkanes over branched ones, with selectivities that align with the model predicting the formation of higher homologues through carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质存在差异。硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物，如[(SiO)2TaH]，展示了将烷烃转化为其更高和更低同系物的能力，从丙烷中得到乙烷和丁烷等。该机制涉及选择性裂解和形成碳-碳键。另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物，具体为[(SiO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]PDA，在烷烃互换反应中的活性和选择性比其钽基催化剂有所提高。这种活性的显著提升可能归因于钨的内在属性，在烯烃互换中起着核心作用。这些钨氢化物在氧化铝上的结构特征是通过共价键固定到表面的孤立钨原子，这促进了与铝物种的最终物种形成反应。催化性能表明，更倾向于线性烷烃而不是分支烷烃，选择性与预测通过碳烯和金属环丁烷中间体形成较高同系物的模型相一致。

The document compares the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides activate C-H bonds through a mechanism involving selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the production of ethane and butanes from propane. The reverse reaction enables methane incorporation into higher alkanes. The document also discusses the preparation of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, noting that heating under hydrogen gas leads to a brown color change, indicative of hydride formation. These thorium hydrides exhibit high activity in alkane metathesis, showing a preference for linear alkanes over branched ones, and producing higher homologues in a specific order (Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3). The document highlights that in both zirconium and thorium systems, the selectivity for higher homologues follows the same trend as observed in olefin metathesis, suggesting a common mechanism involving carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. The alumina-supported thorium hydride (3) shows an overall turnover number (TON) of 120 mol propane mol, surpassing the best known tantalum system, indicating superior activity compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported tantalum hydrides.

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both catalysts used in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are effective in transforming lower alkanes into higher homologues through selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Thorium hydrides on alumina support catalyze the metathesis of propane with higher efficiency compared to zirconium hydrides on silica, as evidenced by the higher overall turnover numbers and product selectivities. Thorium hydrides show less hydrogenolysis capability, leading to a lower selectivity for methane production. The mechanism involves the use of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis, with the trend indicating that tungsten-based catalysts are superior to tantalum-based ones in alkane metathesis.

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides both facilitate C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are capable of selectively cleaving and forming carbon-carbon bonds, converting lower alkanes into higher homologues. They also enable the reverse reaction, allowing methane incorporation into higher alkanes. These catalysts operate via mechanisms involving direct entry into the catalytic cycle through reaction intermediates, suggesting the formation of metallocarbenes based on their activity in olefin metathesis. 

2. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate enhanced activity in alkane metathesis compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. Specifically, thorium hydrides exhibit a higher initial rate and turnover number for propane metathesis, indicating faster reaction kinetics and longer stability. These improvements likely stem from the distinct properties of thorium compared to zirconium, possibly related to the stability of metallacyclobutanes in the reaction mechanism. The enhanced selectivity for higher homologues and reduced methane production also aligns with the proposed model for alkane metathesis, emphasizing the role of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates in the process.

3. The structure of these catalysts includes isolated thorium atoms grafted onto the alumina surface via covalent bonds, consistent with the formation of isolated thorium atoms through a surface organometallic chemistry approach. This structural feature is crucial for the observed catalytic properties, enabling efficient activation and reorganization of alkane molecules through sigma-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis pathways.

4. Chain walking, or the movement of a growing alkane chain along the surface of the catalyst, plays a significant role in enhancing the efficiency of these catalytic systems. This process facilitates the exploration of various reaction pathways, leading to the selective formation of desired alkane products. The combination of high activity, selectivity, and stability makes these catalysts promising for industrial applications in alkane metathesis and related chemical transformations.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在化学中仍然是一个巨大的挑战，特别是在C-H键激活反应、H/D交换和烷烃裂解。硅酸盐支持的锆化氢能够选择性地断裂和形成碳-碳键，将低级烷烃转化为高级同系物。它们还允许反向反应，使甲烷被整合到高级烷烃中。这些催化剂通过直接进入催化循环的中间体机制运行，根据它们在烯烃裂解中的活性提出了金属卡宾的形成。 

2. 相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍化氢在丙烷裂解方面的活性显著优于硅酸盐支持的锆化氢。具体而言，钍化氢在类似条件下表现出更高的初始速率和120小时后的周转数，表明更快的反应动力学和更长的稳定性。这些改进可能源于钍与锆的不同性质，可能与反应机制中金属环丁烷的稳定性有关。较高的高同系物选择性和较低的甲烷产量也与烷烃裂解提出的模型相一致，强调了卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体在过程中的作用。

3. 这些催化剂的结构包括氧化铝表面通过共价键固定在表面上的孤立钍原子。这一结构特征对于观察到的催化性能至关重要，它使烷基链在催化剂表面上的高效活化和重组成为可能，通过σ-键裂解和氢解途径。 

4. 链行走，或增长的烷基链沿催化剂表面的移动，在提高这些催化系统的效率中起着重要作用。这个过程促进了不同反应路径的探索，导致了所需烷烃产品的选择性形成。高活性、选择性和稳定性的结合使得这些催化剂对工业应用中的烷烃裂解及相关化学转换具有前景。
