[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."
[3] "Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes."
[4] "The product selectivities are also noteworthy (Table 2). As observed for Ta, linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivities for higher homologues are as follows: Cn+1>Cn+2>Cn+3."
[5] "Interestingly, in olefin metathesis, the same trend is observed (W-based are much better than Ta-based homogeneous catalysts because of the instability of tantalacyclobutanes)."

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both catalysts used in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are effective in transforming lower alkanes into higher homologues through selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Thorium hydrides on alumina support catalyze the metathesis of propane with higher efficiency compared to zirconium hydrides on silica, as evidenced by the higher overall turnover numbers and product selectivities. Thorium hydrides show less hydrogenolysis capability, leading to a lower selectivity for methane production. The mechanism involves the use of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis, with the trend indicating that tungsten-based catalysts are superior to tantalum-based ones in alkane metathesis.

1. 硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都是用于C-H键激活反应的催化剂。硅支持的锆化氢能够通过选择性裂解和形成碳-碳键，将低级烷烃转化为高级同系物。与硅支持的锆化氢相比，氧化铝支持的钍化氢在丙烷的裂合反应中表现出更高的效率，这体现在更高的整体周转数和产品选择性上。钍化氢的氢解能力较低，导致甲烷生成的选择性较低。这些机制涉及使用卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，类似于烯烃裂合，趋势显示钨基催化剂在烷烃裂合中的性能优于钽基催化剂。
