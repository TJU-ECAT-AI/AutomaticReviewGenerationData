[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."
[3] "Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes."
[4] "The preparation of the corresponding hydride was then investigated. Heating of 2 under H2 for 15 h at 150C caused the pale yellow solid to turn brown."
[5] "These data are therefore consistent with the presence of isolated W atoms grafted to the surface through covalent AlsOW bonds."
[6] "The activity of species 2 and 3 is noteworthy. In contrast to the W complex supported on silica, 2 is active in the metathesis of propane under our standard conditions."
[7] "Under similar conditions, the initial rate (89 molpropane molh−1) and the TON (120 molpropane mol) after 120 h for tungsten hydride 3 are higher than those obtained with the best Ta-based catalysts."
[8] "As observed for Ta, linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivities for higher homologues are as follows: Cn+1>Cn+2>Cn+3."
[9] "Interestingly, in olefin metathesis, the same trend is observed (W-based are much better than Ta-based homogeneous catalysts because of the instability of tantalacyclobutanes)."

The document compares the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides activate C-H bonds through a mechanism involving selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the production of ethane and butanes from propane. The reverse reaction enables methane incorporation into higher alkanes. The document also discusses the preparation of alumina-supported thorium hydrides, noting that heating under hydrogen gas leads to a brown color change, indicative of hydride formation. These thorium hydrides exhibit high activity in alkane metathesis, showing a preference for linear alkanes over branched ones, and producing higher homologues in a specific order (Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3). The document highlights that in both zirconium and thorium systems, the selectivity for higher homologues follows the same trend as observed in olefin metathesis, suggesting a common mechanism involving carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. The alumina-supported thorium hydride (3) shows an overall turnover number (TON) of 120 mol propane mol, surpassing the best known tantalum system, indicating superior activity compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported tantalum hydrides.

文档比较了二氧化硅支持的锆化物氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。二氧化硅支持的锆化物通过选择性裂解和碳碳键形成机制激活C-H键，导致丙烷转化为乙烷和丁烷。逆反应允许甲烷被整合到更高级的烷烃中。文档还讨论了氧化铝支持的钍化物的制备，指出在氢气气体下加热会导致颜色变为棕色，这表明氢化物的形成。这些钍化物在烷烃异构化中表现出高活性，显示出线性烷烃优先于支链烷烃，并按照特定顺序（Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3）产生更高同系物。文档强调，在锆化物和钍化物系统中，更高同系物的选择性遵循与烯烃异构化观察到的相同趋势，暗示存在相同的机制，涉及碳正离子和金属环丁烷中间体。氧化铝支持的钍化物（3）显示总体周转数（TON）为120 mol丙烷 mol，超过已知的钽系统，表明与二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钽化物相比，具有更高的活性。
