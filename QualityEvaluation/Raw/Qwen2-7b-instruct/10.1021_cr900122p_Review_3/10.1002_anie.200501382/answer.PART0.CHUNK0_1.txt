[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (4550%) and butanes (3035%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."
[3] "We have recently shown that the reaction of [W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (1) with partially dehydroxylated silica (PDS) at 700C generates the corresponding supported metallocarbyne [(SiO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]PDS (2) instead of a metallocarbene."
[4] "Although highly active in olefin metathesis and highly electrophilic (formal 12-electron species),1315 this complex and the corresponding hydride displayed little to no activity in alkane metathesis.4,5"
[5] "These data are therefore consistent with the presence of isolated W atoms grafted to the surface through covalent AlsOW bonds."
[6] "The formation of the final species probably involves the reaction of WH with adjacent AlOAl bridges or AlOH species (Scheme 2)."
[7] "However, its activity is similar to that of [(SiO)2TaH] (for 4 : initial rate=2.5 molpropane molh1 and TON=60 molpropane mol)."
[8] "As observed for Ta, linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivities for higher homologues are as follows: Cn+1>Cn+2Cn+3."

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides, such as [(SiO)2TaH], have demonstrated the ability to selectively transform alkanes into their higher and lower homologues, yielding ethane and butanes from propane, among others. The mechanism involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, specifically [(SiO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]PDA, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity in alkane metathesis compared to their tantalum counterparts. This improvement in activity is likely due to the intrinsic properties of tungsten, which plays a central role in olefin metathesis. The structure of these tungsten hydrides on alumina is characterized by isolated tungsten atoms grafted to the surface through covalent bonds, which facilitates the formation of final species involving reactions with aluminum species. The catalytic properties highlight a preference for linear alkanes over branched ones, with selectivities that align with the model predicting the formation of higher homologues through carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质存在差异。硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物，如[(SiO)2TaH]，展示了将烷烃转化为其更高和更低同系物的能力，从丙烷中得到乙烷和丁烷等。该机制涉及选择性裂解和形成碳-碳键。另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物，具体为[(SiO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]PDA，在烷烃互换反应中的活性和选择性比其钽基催化剂有所提高。这种活性的显著提升可能归因于钨的内在属性，在烯烃互换中起着核心作用。这些钨氢化物在氧化铝上的结构特征是通过共价键固定到表面的孤立钨原子，这促进了与铝物种的最终物种形成反应。催化性能表明，更倾向于线性烷烃而不是分支烷烃，选择性与预测通过碳烯和金属环丁烷中间体形成较高同系物的模型相一致。
