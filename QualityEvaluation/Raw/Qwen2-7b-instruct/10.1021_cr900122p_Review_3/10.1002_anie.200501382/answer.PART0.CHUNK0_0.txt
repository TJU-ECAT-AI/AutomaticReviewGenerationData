[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."
[3] "The improvement of activity on changing from Ta in 2 to W in 1 and the product selectivity show that olefin metathesis is probably the key process in CC bond formation in the alkane metathesis reaction."
[4] "Tungsten hydride 3 has an overall turnover number of 120 mol propane mol, which is much higher than that of the best known Ta system, that is, tantalum hydrides supported on silica or alumina."
[5] "These data corroborate what we observed and proposed earlier: alkane metathesis proceeds via carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates."

The silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity and selectivity in alkane metathesis, selectively forming ethane and butanes from propane. This is attributed to the olefin metathesis mechanism being the key process in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides display significantly higher activity and turnover numbers in alkane metathesis compared to the best-known zirconium hydrides. The improved catalytic performance of thorium hydrides is believed to arise from the enhanced reactivity and stability of thorium-based intermediates, such as carbenes and metallacyclobutanes, involved in alkane metathesis. The higher selectivity for linear over branched alkanes in thorium-based catalysts is consistent with the proposed model of alkane metathesis, where 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes favor the formation of higher homologues over less reactive 1,2-disubstituted carbenes.

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质存在差异。硅基锆化物在烷烃裂合中表现出高活性和选择性，能够从丙烷选择性地形成乙烷和丁烷。这归因于烯烃裂合机制是烷烃裂合中形成碳-碳键的关键过程。另一方面，氧化铝基钍化物在烷烃裂合中的活性和周转数显著高于已知的最佳锆化物。钍基催化剂的增强催化性能可能是由于钍基中间体（如卡宾和金属环丁烷）的反应性和稳定性增强所致。钍基催化剂对线性化合物的选择性高于支链化合物，与烷烃裂合提出的模型一致，其中1,3-二取代金属环丁烷有利于形成更高同系物，而非更不活跃的1,2-二取代卡宾。
