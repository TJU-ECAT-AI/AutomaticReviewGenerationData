[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."
[3] "Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes."
[4] "The goal of which is to enter directly into the catalytic cycle via reaction intermediates."
[5] "It was proposed that metallocarbenes were formed on the basis of their activity in olefin metathesis."
[6] "Therefore, we decided to generate more electrophilic centers by preparing the corresponding W alkyl and hydride on partially dehydroxylated alumina (PDA)."
[7] "In contrast to the W complex supported on silica, 2 is active in the metathesis of propane under our standard conditions."
[8] "The initial rate is 1.8 mol propane mol^-1 h^-1, which is slightly lower than that of [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (3.0 mol propane mol^-1 h^-1, turnover number (TON)=35 mol propane mol at 120 h), but the TONs after 120 h are similar, which indicates that deactivation of this catalyst is slower."
[9] "Under similar conditions, the initial rate (89 mol propane mol^-1 h^-1) and the TON (120 mol propane mol) after 120 h for tungsten hydride 3 are higher than those obtained with the best Ta-based catalysts."
[10] "These data are therefore consistent with the presence of isolated W atoms grafted to the surface through covalent AlsOW bonds."

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides both facilitate C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are capable of selectively cleaving and forming carbon-carbon bonds, converting lower alkanes into higher homologues. They also enable the reverse reaction, allowing methane incorporation into higher alkanes. These catalysts operate via mechanisms involving direct entry into the catalytic cycle through reaction intermediates, suggesting the formation of metallocarbenes based on their activity in olefin metathesis. 

2. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate enhanced activity in alkane metathesis compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. Specifically, thorium hydrides exhibit a higher initial rate and turnover number for propane metathesis, indicating faster reaction kinetics and longer stability. These improvements likely stem from the distinct properties of thorium compared to zirconium, possibly related to the stability of metallacyclobutanes in the reaction mechanism. The enhanced selectivity for higher homologues and reduced methane production also aligns with the proposed model for alkane metathesis, emphasizing the role of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates in the process.

3. The structure of these catalysts includes isolated thorium atoms grafted onto the alumina surface via covalent bonds, consistent with the formation of isolated thorium atoms through a surface organometallic chemistry approach. This structural feature is crucial for the observed catalytic properties, enabling efficient activation and reorganization of alkane molecules through sigma-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis pathways.

4. Chain walking, or the movement of a growing alkane chain along the surface of the catalyst, plays a significant role in enhancing the efficiency of these catalytic systems. This process facilitates the exploration of various reaction pathways, leading to the selective formation of desired alkane products. The combination of high activity, selectivity, and stability makes these catalysts promising for industrial applications in alkane metathesis and related chemical transformations.

1. 硅酸盐支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在化学中仍然是一个巨大的挑战，特别是在C-H键激活反应、H/D交换和烷烃裂解。硅酸盐支持的锆化氢能够选择性地断裂和形成碳-碳键，将低级烷烃转化为高级同系物。它们还允许反向反应，使甲烷被整合到高级烷烃中。这些催化剂通过直接进入催化循环的中间体机制运行，根据它们在烯烃裂解中的活性提出了金属卡宾的形成。 

2. 相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍化氢在丙烷裂解方面的活性显著优于硅酸盐支持的锆化氢。具体而言，钍化氢在类似条件下表现出更高的初始速率和120小时后的周转数，表明更快的反应动力学和更长的稳定性。这些改进可能源于钍与锆的不同性质，可能与反应机制中金属环丁烷的稳定性有关。较高的高同系物选择性和较低的甲烷产量也与烷烃裂解提出的模型相一致，强调了卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体在过程中的作用。

3. 这些催化剂的结构包括氧化铝表面通过共价键固定在表面上的孤立钍原子。这一结构特征对于观察到的催化性能至关重要，它使烷基链在催化剂表面上的高效活化和重组成为可能，通过σ-键裂解和氢解途径。 

4. 链行走，或增长的烷基链沿催化剂表面的移动，在提高这些催化系统的效率中起着重要作用。这个过程促进了不同反应路径的探索，导致了所需烷烃产品的选择性形成。高活性、选择性和稳定性的结合使得这些催化剂对工业应用中的烷烃裂解及相关化学转换具有前景。
