Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions reveals distinct characteristics. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are typically synthesized through the reduction of zirconium dioxide with hydrogen or other reducing agents, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides are created by treating thorium oxide with hydrogen or utilizing a hydriding process. 

In H/D exchange reactions, the mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis, playing a pivotal role in the activation and transformation of hydrocarbon moieties. Hydrogenolysis is a key component in alkane metathesis, enabling the cleavage of C-H bonds and the rearrangement of alkane structures. Chain walking describes the movement of a double bond along the alkane chain in alkane metathesis, facilitating the creation of new alkene products. 

Regarding reaction rates and selectivity, the literature does not provide specific details comparing these properties between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, the mechanisms described suggest that both materials can effectively participate in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions, with the role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking being integral to their catalytic activities.

对比二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，可以发现它们具有不同的特征。二氧化硅支持的锆化氢通常通过氧化锆与氢或其他还原剂的还原作用制备，而氧化铝支持的钍化氢则是通过处理钍氧化物与氢或采用氢化过程合成。

在H/D交换反应中，σ键的互换机制对于烃基团的活化和转化至关重要。在烷烃互换反应中，氢解作用是关键部分，它能够使C-H键断裂，并促进烷烃结构的重组。链行走描述的是烷烃互换反应中双键沿烷烃链移动的过程，这有助于新烯烃产品的形成。

关于反应速率和选择性，文献没有提供这两类材料之间具体比较的数据。然而，所描述的机制表明，两者都能有效参与H/D交换和烷烃互换反应，σ键互换、氢解作用和链行走在它们的催化活性中起着核心作用。
