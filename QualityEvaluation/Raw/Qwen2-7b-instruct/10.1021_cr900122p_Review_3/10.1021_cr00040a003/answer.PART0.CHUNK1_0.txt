Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are utilized in C-H bond activation reactions due to their distinct catalytic properties. Zirconium hydrides on silica offer higher activity and better selectivity for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange reactions compared to thorium hydrides on alumina. The mechanism for H/D exchange on zirconium hydrides typically involves the formation of a σ-bond metathesis intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, in contrast, are more efficient in alkane metathesis reactions, enabling the rearrangement of alkene units. These materials demonstrate the capability of chain walking, allowing for dynamic rearrangement of alkyl groups in alkane metathesis. Reaction rates for H/D exchange on zirconium hydrides are generally faster than those on thorium hydrides. Selectivity in H/D exchange reactions is higher for zirconium hydrides on silica, while thorium hydrides on alumina show higher selectivity in alkane metathesis. Both materials are capable of hydrogenolysis, but the mechanism differs, with zirconium hydrides often exhibiting a more direct hydrogen removal process.

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键激活反应中因其独特的催化性质而被广泛研究。锆化物在硅上的活性和H/D交换反应的选择性通常高于钍化物在氧化铝上的活性。锆化物在硅上的机制通常涉及形成σ键互换中间体，随后进行氢解离。相比之下，氧化铝基钍化物在烷烃互换反应中更为有效，能够促进烯烃单位的重排。这些材料表现出链行走的能力，允许动态重组烷基团。在烷烃互换中，它们能够实现动态重组烷基团。反应速率在锆化物硅基上的H/D交换通常比钍化物氧化铝上的速率更快。H/D交换反应的选择性更高于硅基锆化物，而氧化铝基钍化物在烷烃互换中的选择性更高。这两种材料都具有氢解离的能力，但机制不同，锆化物往往展现出更直接的氢去除过程。
