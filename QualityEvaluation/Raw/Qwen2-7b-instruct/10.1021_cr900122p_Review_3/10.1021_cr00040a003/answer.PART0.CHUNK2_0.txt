1. Ethylene self-hydrogenation has been observed on Ni(ll1) under high pressures and on Pd(ll1) at room temperature. However, no detectable ethane formation from adsorbed ethylene has been observed on nickel.

2. The hydrogenation process of ethylene involves a stepwise mechanism, starting with the migratory insertion of ethylene into a metal-hydrogen bond, followed by the reductive elimination of the resulting alkyl intermediate with a second coordinated hydrogen atom.

3. Alkane hydrogenolysis, alkane isomerization, and alkane cyclization have been extensively studied on single-crystal surfaces under catalytic conditions.

4. The catalytic exchange of hydrogens for deuteriums in hydrocarbon molecules has been primarily studied for a few alkanes on platinum single-crystal surfaces.

5. The thermal activation of cyclohexane over platinum single-crystal surfaces results in significant quantities of methyl cyclopentane and benzene.

1. 在高压下，乙烷自我氢化在Ni(ll1)晶面上被观察到，并且在室温下的Pd(ll1)分子束研究中也观察到了乙烷自我氢化。然而，在镍上没有观察到从吸附的乙烷形成可检测的乙烷。

2. 乙烷的氢化过程涉及一个逐步机制，首先是以乙烷插入金属-氢键开始，随后是生成的烷基中间体与第二个配位氢原子的还原消除。

3. 在单晶表面下催化条件下，烷烃氢解、烷烃异构化和烷烃环化已被广泛研究。

4. 目前，氢气与氘之间的催化交换仅在铂单晶表面上的几种烷烃上进行了研究。

5. 在铂单晶表面上热激活环己烷导致了大量的甲基环戊烷和苯的产生。
