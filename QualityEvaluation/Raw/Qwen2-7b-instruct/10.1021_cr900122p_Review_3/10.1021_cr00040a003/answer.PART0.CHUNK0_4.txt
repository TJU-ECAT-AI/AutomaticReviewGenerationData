[1] "Alkyl iodides are commonly used in these studies as precursors for the preparation of alkyl groups on metal surfaces, since the C-I bond is easily activated at temperatures below 200 K . 7 3 The selective desorption of CH3- CD=CHz from the 2,2-dideuteriopropyl group that forms in this case indicates that P-hydride elimination reactions are highly preferred over a- or y-H eliminations (which would produce either Do or Dz-propenes)."
[2] "p-Hydride eliminations on metal surfaces have been addressed by a few research groups."
[3] "An elegant series of experiments using fluorine-substituted propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have demonstrated the anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in the same way as previously reported for organometallic compounds."
[4] "The positive charge that develops on the 8 carbon in the transition state is also stabilized by electron-donating groups such as alkyls, making the reaction on either propyl or butyl species faster than on ethyl species."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct properties in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides facilitate H/D exchange reactions with high rates and selectivity, as evidenced by the efficient conversion of alkanes to their deuterated counterparts. The mechanism typically involves σ-bond metathesis, where the hydride ion abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of a zirconium hydride complex that then facilitates the exchange reaction.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are more effective in alkane metathesis reactions, primarily through hydrogenolysis and chain walking mechanisms. These processes involve the cleavage of C-H bonds and the subsequent rearrangement of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of new alkane isomers. Thorium hydrides' unique acidic properties enable them to promote these reactions with high efficiency and selectivity, making them suitable for applications requiring the transformation of alkanes into desired isomers.

Both types of hydrides rely on the activation of C-H bonds to initiate the desired chemical transformations. The selectivity and rate of these reactions are influenced by factors such as the nature of the support material, the presence of acid sites, and the specific properties of the metal hydride. The anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in p-hydride eliminations, demonstrated through fluorine-substituted propyl groups on copper surfaces, plays a crucial role in these mechanisms. The stabilization of the positive charge on the 8 carbon by alkyl groups accelerates the reaction, indicating the importance of electron-donating groups in enhancing the activity of these catalysts.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides excel in H/D exchange reactions due to their efficient σ-bond metathesis capabilities, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides are more adept at alkane metathesis through hydrogenolysis and chain walking mechanisms. The selectivity and rate of these reactions are influenced by various factors, including the properties of the catalyst and the specific reaction conditions.

硅基锆化物和氧化铝基钍化物在C-H键激活反应中表现出不同的特性，特别是在氢/氘交换和烷烃异构化方面。硅基锆化物能够高效地促进氢/氘交换反应，选择性地将烷烃转化为其氘代衍生物。这些过程通常涉及σ键的重组，其中氢离子从烷烃中抽取，形成锆化氢复合物，随后该复合物促进交换反应。

相比之下，氧化铝基钍化物在烷烃异构化反应中表现更为出色，主要通过氢解离和链行走机制。这些过程涉及C-H键的断裂以及烷基团的重新排列，导致新烷烃异构体的形成。钍化物的独特酸性性质使它们能够以高效率和选择性促进这些反应，使其适用于需要将烷烃转化为所需异构体的应用。

这两种类型的化物都依赖于激活C-H键来启动所需的化学转化。这些反应的选择性和速率受到支持材料的性质、酸位的存在以及金属化物的特定属性的影响。氟代丙基组分在铜表面上的p-脱氢消除中所展示的阴离子性质对这些机制至关重要。在8碳上形成的正电荷被烷基团的稳定化加速了反应，表明电子供体团对于增强这些催化剂的活性具有重要影响。

简而言之，硅基锆化物在氢/氘交换反应中表现出色，由于其高效的σ键重组能力，而氧化铝基钍化物则在烷烃异构化过程中通过氢解离和链行走机制表现出优势。这些反应的选择性和速率受多种因素的影响，包括催化剂的性质和特定的反应条件。
