Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are primarily used for H/D exchange reactions, where the hydride group is selectively replaced by deuterium. This process occurs quickly, typically within minutes under suitable conditions. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, are utilized in alkane metathesis reactions, which facilitate the rearrangement of alkane chains with high selectivity for chain walking, leading to the formation of isomers. σ-bond metathesis is a critical component in alkane metathesis, allowing for the restructuring of alkene structures. Both types of supported hydrides are conducive to hydrogenolysis reactions, enabling the cleavage of alkyl groups.

硅基载锆化氢主要用于H/D交换反应，其中氢化物组分被选择性地替换为氘。这一过程通常在几分钟内完成，在适当的条件下。而氧化铝基载钍化氢则用于烷烃异构化反应，促进烷烃链的重排，具有很高的链行走选择性，主要产生同分异构体。σ键异构化是烷烃异构化中的关键部分，允许烯烃结构的重新排列。两种类型的载氢化合物都适合于氢解反应，能够分解烷基团。
