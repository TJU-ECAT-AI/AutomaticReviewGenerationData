1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by impregnating zirconium salts onto silica supports, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides are synthesized through a sol-gel process followed by reduction.
2. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrate faster reaction rates in C-H bond activation due to their higher surface area, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides offer better stability under harsh conditions.
3. The mechanism of H/D exchange involving silica-supported zirconium hydrides includes hydrogenolysis followed by σ-bond metathesis to reform the alkane.
4. Alkane metathesis catalyzed by alumina-supported thorium hydrides benefits from chain walking facilitated by appropriate activation sites on the catalyst surface.

1. 制备二氧化硅支持的锆化氢涉及将锆盐浸渍到二氧化硅载体上。而氧化铝支持的钍化氢通常通过溶胶-凝胶过程后进行还原合成。
2. 二氧化硅支持的锆化氢在C-H键活化中显示出更快的反应速率，由于其更高的比表面积；相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍化氢在恶劣条件下展现出更好的稳定性。
3. 包含二氧化硅支持的锆化氢的H/D交换机制包括氢解离随后σ键异构化以重新形成烷烃。
4. 氧化铝支持的钍化氢催化裂化中的链行走得益于催化剂表面上合适的激活位点促进的链行走。
