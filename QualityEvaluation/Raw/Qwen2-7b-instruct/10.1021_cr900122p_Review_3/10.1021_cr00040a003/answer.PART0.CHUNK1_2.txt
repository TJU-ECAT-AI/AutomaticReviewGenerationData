Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are utilized in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides excel in H/D exchange, facilitating the conversion of alkanes into alcohols with a high rate of exchange. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, conversely, are proficient in alkane metathesis, promoting chain walking and σ-bond metathesis to enable the rearrangement of alkene chains. Hydrogenolysis plays a crucial role in these reactions, driving the formation of alcohols from alkanes during H/D exchange. Chain walking is a distinctive characteristic of these catalytic processes, allowing for the sequential rearrangement of alkene chains to form new products. In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides are effective in H/D exchange, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides are skilled in alkane metathesis, displaying distinct catalytic properties in C-H bond activation.
