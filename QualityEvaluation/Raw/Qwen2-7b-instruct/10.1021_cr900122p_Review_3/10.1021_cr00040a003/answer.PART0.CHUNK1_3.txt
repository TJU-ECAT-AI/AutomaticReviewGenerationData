[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are typically prepared through the hydrothermal synthesis of zirconium halides or zirconocene compounds followed by reduction with hydrogen gas."
[2] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are often synthesized by impregnating thorium oxide with a hydride source such as sodium borohydride or lithium aluminum hydride."
[3] "In C-H bond activation reactions, silica-supported zirconium hydrides often exhibit high activity and selectivity for H/D exchange reactions, primarily due to the strong Lewis acidity of zirconium and the presence of the silica support."
[4] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, are typically more effective for alkane metathesis reactions, as the strong Bronsted acidity of thorium and the Lewis basicity of alumina support facilitate the formation of alkene intermediates."
[5] "The mechanism of H/D exchange in silica-supported zirconium hydrides often involves the formation of a zirconium hydride intermediate, followed by a σ-bond metathesis reaction to exchange the hydrogen atoms."
[6] "Alkane metathesis catalyzed by alumina-supported thorium hydrides involves the formation of an alkene intermediate, which then undergoes a hydrogenolysis step to yield alkane products."
[7] "Reaction rates in C-H bond activation reactions are typically influenced by factors such as support material, metal loading, and the presence of co-catalysts."
[8] "Selectivity in these reactions is often determined by the balance between competing pathways, such as H/D exchange versus alkane metathesis."
[9] "Chain walking in the context of C-H bond activation refers to the ability of the catalyst to move along the carbon chain during the reaction, which can influence the selectivity towards branched or linear alkane products."
[10] "Both silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides can demonstrate high turnover frequencies, with the former excelling in H/D exchange and the latter in alkane metathesis."

1. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared through hydrothermal synthesis of zirconium halides or zirconocene followed by hydrogen reduction, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides are synthesized by impregnating thorium oxide with hydride sources. 
2. Zirconium hydrides are strong Lewis acids, making them effective for H/D exchange reactions, whereas thorium hydrides' strong Bronsted acidity and Lewis basicity support alkane metathesis. 
3. The H/D exchange mechanism involves a zirconium hydride intermediate followed by σ-bond metathesis, while alkane metathesis catalyzed by thorium hydrides involves alkene formation and hydrogenolysis.
4. Reaction rates and selectivity are influenced by support material, metal loading, and co-catalysts. 
5. Chain walking affects catalyst movement along the carbon chain, impacting product selectivity towards branched or linear alkanes.
6. Both catalysts show high turnover frequencies, with zirconium excelling in H/D exchange and thorium in alkane metathesis.

1. Si基锆化氢通过水热合成锆卤化物或锆化物前体并随后用氢气还原制备。而氧化铝基钍化氢则通过将钍氧化物浸渍在如硼氢化钠或铝锂氢化物等氢化物来源中制备。
2. 锆化氢是强Lewis酸，使其在H/D交换反应中表现出高活性和选择性，而钍化氢的强Bronsted酸性和氧化铝支持的Lewis碱性促进烷烃裂解。
3. H/D交换机制涉及形成锆化氢中间体，随后进行σ键转移以交换氢原子。而由钍化氢催化裂解的烷烃裂变涉及形成烯烃中间体，然后进行氢解以产生烷烃产品。
4. 反应速率和选择性受到支撑材料、金属负载和共催化剂的影响。
5. 链行走影响催化剂沿碳链的移动，影响产物的选择性，倾向于支链或线性烷烃。
6. 两种催化剂都显示出高转率频率，锆化氢在H/D交换中表现出色，而钍化氢在烷烃裂变中表现出色。
