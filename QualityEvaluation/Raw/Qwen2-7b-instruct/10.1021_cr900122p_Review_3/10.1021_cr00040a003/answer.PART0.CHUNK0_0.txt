<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The preparation of alkyl groups on metal surfaces often uses alkyl iodides as precursors. The reason is that the C-I bond can be easily activated at temperatures below 200 K, facilitating the attachment of alkyl groups to metal surfaces.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The mechanism for the 8-H elimination on metal surfaces has been explored by several research teams. A series of sophisticated experiments involving fluorinated propyl groups on Cu(ll1) have shown that the departing hydrogen exhibits anionic characteristics, similar to previous findings in organometallic compounds.
