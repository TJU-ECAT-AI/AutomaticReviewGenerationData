[1] "By far the most common decomposition pathway in complexes with alkyl ligands is the loss of a hydrogen atom from the second carbon from the metal center (the β position). This so-called β-hydride elimination reaction is believed to take place in a concerted step, via a planar four-center transition state which decomposes to form an (r2- alkene)metal-hydride complex."
[2] "The selectivity for β over either α or γ-hydride elimination was clearly demonstrated on both Cu(llO)M and Ni(100) surfaces by isotope labeling studies (Figure 9), and additional studies highlighted the ease with which β-elimination occurs on other surfaces for straight alkyl chains of up to six carbon atoms, as well as for branched species such as isopropyl and isobutyl."
[3] "σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are some of the mechanisms involved in alkane metathesis reactions."
[4] "In H/D exchange reactions, the selectivity and rate of reaction are influenced by factors such as the presence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the alkyl ligands."

1. The β-hydride elimination reaction is a common pathway in complexes with alkyl ligands, occurring via a concerted step involving a four-center transition state that forms an (r2- alkene)metal-hydride complex. This reaction is highly selective for β-hydride elimination, as demonstrated in studies on Cu(llO)M and Ni(100) surfaces. β-elimination is also observed in other surfaces for alkyl chains up to six carbon atoms and branched species like isopropyl and isobutyl.

2. σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are mechanisms involved in alkane metathesis reactions. These processes involve the rearrangement of alkene bonds, the cleavage of alkene bonds with hydrogen, and the movement of alkene segments along the chain, respectively.

3. In H/D exchange reactions, the selectivity and rate of the reaction are influenced by the presence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the alkyl ligands. These groups can affect the reactivity of the alkyl groups and thus impact the efficiency of the H/D exchange process.

1. 在含烷基配体的复合物中，β氢消除反应是常见的分解途径，通过一个协同步骤发生，涉及一个平面的四个中心过渡态，形成一个(r2-烯烃)金属氢化物复合物。该反应对于β氢消除具有高度的选择性，在Cu(llO)M和Ni(100)表面的实验中得到证实。对于碳原子数最多为六的直链烷基链以及异丙基和异丁基等分支物种，β消除在其他表面上也易于观察。

2. σ键裂合、氢解和链行走是烷烃裂合反应中的机制。这些过程涉及烯烃键的重组、烯烃键与氢的断裂以及链段沿着链的移动，分别对应于σ键裂合、氢解和链行走。

3. 在H/D交换反应中，选择性和反应速率受到烷基配体上给电子或吸电子基团的存在影响。这些基团可以影响烷基团的反应活性，从而影响H/D交换过程的效率。
