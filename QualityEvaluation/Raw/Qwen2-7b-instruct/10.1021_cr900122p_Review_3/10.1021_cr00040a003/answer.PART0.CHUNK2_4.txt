[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides have been widely used in H/D exchange reactions, primarily due to their high surface area and good thermal stability. They enable efficient H/D exchange through mechanisms involving σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis."
[2] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, have been utilized in alkane metathesis reactions. These materials exhibit high selectivity in alkane metathesis, often due to the role of chain walking in facilitating the rearrangement of alkane chains."
[3] "The reaction rates for H/D exchange on silica-supported zirconium hydrides are typically faster than on alumina-supported thorium hydrides, attributed to the higher surface area and greater accessibility of the zirconium hydride sites."
[4] "Selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions using alumina-supported thorium hydrides is often determined by the specific orientation of the thorium hydride sites, allowing for efficient chain walking and alkane rearrangement."
[5] "Both silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides require careful control of surface coverage to optimize reaction rates and selectivity. High coverage can lead to adsorbate-adsorbate interactions that modify reaction pathways."
