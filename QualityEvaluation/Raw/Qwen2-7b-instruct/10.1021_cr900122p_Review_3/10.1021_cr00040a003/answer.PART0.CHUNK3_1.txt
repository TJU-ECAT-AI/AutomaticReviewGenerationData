The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions are discussed. These catalysts are highly reactive, selective, and efficient in processes such as H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. They utilize mechanisms including σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The detailed mechanisms and properties are elaborated upon throughout the literature.
