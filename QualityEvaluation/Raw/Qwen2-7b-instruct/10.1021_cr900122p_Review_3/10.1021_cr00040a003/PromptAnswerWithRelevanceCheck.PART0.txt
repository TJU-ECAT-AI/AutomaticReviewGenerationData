Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are utilized in C-H bond activation reactions due to their distinct catalytic properties. Zirconium hydrides on silica offer higher activity and better selectivity for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange reactions compared to thorium hydrides on alumina. The mechanism for H/D exchange on zirconium hydrides typically involves the formation of a σ-bond metathesis intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, in contrast, are more efficient in alkane metathesis reactions, enabling the rearrangement of alkene units. These materials demonstrate the capability of chain walking, allowing for dynamic rearrangement of alkyl groups in alkane metathesis. Reaction rates for H/D exchange on zirconium hydrides are generally faster than those on thorium hydrides. Selectivity in H/D exchange reactions is higher for zirconium hydrides on silica, while thorium hydrides on alumina show higher selectivity in alkane metathesis. Both materials are capable of hydrogenolysis, but the mechanism differs, with zirconium hydrides often exhibiting a more direct hydrogen removal process.

The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides involve the use of zirconium compounds, such as zirconocene, supported on silica. The structure of these materials typically consists of zirconium atoms embedded within a silica matrix, which can be synthesized through various methods including sol-gel techniques or impregnation. Silica supports offer good thermal stability and high surface area, which are advantageous for heterogeneous catalysis. 

Thorium hydrides supported on alumina exhibit a similar concept where thorium-based compounds are immobilized onto an alumina support. Alumina provides a stable framework for the thorium hydride species, facilitating their use in catalytic applications. The structure of these catalysts often depends on the method of synthesis and the specific properties of the alumina used.

In terms of catalytic properties, both silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides have been utilized in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. They show distinct capabilities in these processes due to the different reactivities of the metals involved. For instance, zirconium hydrides tend to promote σ-bond metathesis, whereas thorium hydrides might be more effective in hydrogenolysis and chain walking reactions.

Regarding reaction rates and selectivity, studies indicate that the choice of support (silica vs. alumina) can influence these parameters. For example, silica supports may offer better selectivity in certain reactions due to their higher surface area, while alumina supports could enhance stability and resistance to deactivation over time.

However, detailed mechanisms for these reactions, such as the role of specific surface sites, the coordination of metal centers, and the dynamics of substrate binding and product release, require further investigation based on experimental data and theoretical calculations.

二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物的制备、结构和催化性质涉及使用如锆二烷基化合物（如锆二烷基）在二氧化硅上的负载。这些材料的结构通常包括嵌入在二氧化硅网络中的锆原子，通过溶胶-凝胶技术或浸渍法等方法合成。二氧化硅支持材料提供了良好的热稳定性与高比表面积，这对于均相催化反应非常有利。

氧化铝支持的钍氢化物也采用类似的概念，将钍基化合物固定在氧化铝载体上。氧化铝提供了一个稳定的基础，使钍氢化物物种得以应用。这些催化剂的结构往往取决于合成方法和特定的氧化铝特性。

至于催化性能，在C-H键活化反应中，特别是H/D交换和烷烃裂合，这两种材料被用作催化剂。由于金属的活性差异，它们在这些过程中表现出不同的能力。例如，锆氢化物倾向于促进σ键的裂合，而钍氢化物可能更适合氢解和链行走反应。

关于反应速率和选择性，研究表明，支持物的选择（二氧化硅vs. 氧化铝）会影响这些参数。例如，二氧化硅支持物可能在某些反应中提供更好的选择性，因为其更高的比表面积，而氧化铝支持物则可能增强稳定性并减少失活时间。

然而，这些反应的具体机制，如表面特定位点的作用、金属中心的配位、底物结合和产物释放的动力学，需要基于实验数据和理论计算的进一步研究。

The literature discusses various aspects of ethylene hydrogenation on metal surfaces. It mentions that ethylene self-hydrogenates at around 300 K under saturation coverages on Pt(ll1) surfaces, yielding ethane at a low yield of a few percent. The reaction is observed on Ni(ll1) under high pressures and on Pd(ll1) in molecular beam studies at room temperature. However, no ethane formation from adsorbed ethylene has been observed on nickel, palladium, rhodium, or ruthenium surfaces. Ethylene hydrogenation involves a stepwise mechanism, starting with the migratory insertion of ethylene into a metal-hydrogen bond followed by reductive elimination of the resulting alkyl intermediate with a second coordinated hydrogen atom. The activation energies for these steps are approximately 13 kcal/mol for ethyl formation and 5 kcal/mol for ethane desorption on Pt(111), while on Ni(100) surfaces, these values are around 10 kcal/mol and less than 5 kcal/mol, respectively. Ethylene can also form from acetylene, a reaction observed specifically on palladium surfaces. Ethylene is produced on Pd(100) and Pd(lll) but not on Pd(110) surfaces. Hydrogen coadsorption enhances the production of hydrogenated compounds, including ethylene, on various surfaces. The literature suggests that hydrogen mobility plays a crucial role in determining the rate of the overall hydrogenation process in crowded substrate environments.

1. The β-hydride elimination reaction is a common pathway in complexes with alkyl ligands, occurring via a concerted step involving a four-center transition state that forms an (r2- alkene)metal-hydride complex. This reaction is highly selective for β-hydride elimination, as demonstrated in studies on Cu(llO)M and Ni(100) surfaces. β-elimination is also observed in other surfaces for alkyl chains up to six carbon atoms and branched species like isopropyl and isobutyl.

2. σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are mechanisms involved in alkane metathesis reactions. These processes involve the rearrangement of alkene bonds, the cleavage of alkene bonds with hydrogen, and the movement of alkene segments along the chain, respectively.

3. In H/D exchange reactions, the selectivity and rate of the reaction are influenced by the presence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the alkyl ligands. These groups can affect the reactivity of the alkyl groups and thus impact the efficiency of the H/D exchange process.

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, it appears that these two types of catalysts exhibit distinct behaviors in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis processes. 

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides generally show high reactivity in C-H bond activation due to the presence of active zirconium sites. These catalysts are known to undergo σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis, facilitating the transfer of hydrogen atoms during H/D exchange reactions. The high surface area of silica allows for a larger dispersion of the zirconium hydride, which may enhance the rate of reactions and provide better access to the C-H bonds for activation.

On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides typically demonstrate lower reactivity compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. The thorium species, being less reactive than zirconium, might require more energy to activate the C-H bonds. However, alumina supports can provide a stable environment for the thorium hydrides, which could be advantageous for certain reactions where stability is crucial. The role of hydrogenolysis in these systems is less pronounced, and the catalytic activity might be more dependent on the thorium's ability to form complexes with the support material.

Regarding reaction rates, silica-supported zirconium hydrides are likely to have faster rates due to their higher reactivity. Selectivity might be influenced by the specific conditions of the reaction, such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the substrate, rather than solely by the type of support material.

In terms of mechanisms, both systems involve the breaking and forming of bonds, but the specifics can vary. For instance, in silica-supported zirconium hydrides, σ-bond metathesis might play a significant role in facilitating the rearrangement of carbon atoms, whereas in alumina-supported thorium hydrides, the focus might be more on the stabilization of the activated state through interactions with the support.

To summarize, while both catalysts enable C-H bond activation, the silica-supported zirconium hydrides tend to be more reactive and selective, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides offer stability and potentially different reaction pathways due to the nature of the thorium species and its interaction with the support.

比较二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，它们在H/D交换和烷烃裂合过程中表现出不同的行为。

二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物通常显示出高活性，在C-H键活化中，由于存在活泼的锆物种。这些催化剂在进行H/D交换反应时，通常会经历σ键的裂合与重组，促进氢原子的转移。二氧化硅的高比表面积有助于分散锆氢化物，这可能增加反应速率并提供更好的C-H键访问途径，从而增强C-H键的激活。

相比之下，氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的活性通常较低，相比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物而言。钍物种的活性较弱，可能需要更多的能量来激活C-H键。然而，氧化铝支持材料可以为钍氢化物提供稳定的环境，这对于某些反应而言至关重要，尤其是在稳定性要求较高的情况下。在这些系统中，氢解离的作用可能不那么显著，催化剂活性更多地取决于钍物种与支持材料形成复合物的能力。

关于反应速率，二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物可能更快，因为它们更活泼。选择性可能会受到特定反应条件的影响，如温度、压力和底物的性质，而不是仅由支撑材料类型决定。

就机制而言，虽然两个系统都涉及键的断裂和形成，但具体细节可能有所不同。例如，在二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物中，σ键的裂合可能在促进碳原子重排方面起着重要作用，而在氧化铝负载的钍氢化物中，焦点可能更多地放在通过与支撑材料的相互作用稳定激活状态上。

简而言之，尽管两种催化剂都能实现C-H键活化，但二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物倾向于具有更高的反应性和选择性，而氧化铝负载的钍氢化物则提供了稳定性，并可能因钍物种的性质及其与支撑材料的相互作用而展现出不同的反应路径。

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions reveals distinct characteristics. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically exhibit a more complex structure due to the interaction between zirconium and silica, leading to a variety of surface functionalities. These functionalities enable a broad spectrum of catalytic activities, including H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The mechanism for H/D exchange involves the initial oxidative addition of the alkene followed by a reduction elimination of the resulting vinyl with a deuteron atom. Alkane metathesis occurs through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, where the zirconium center facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between the catalyst and the alkane substrate.

On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides present a simpler structure, primarily due to the nature of the support material (alumina). The thorium hydride layers on the alumina support offer a distinct surface chemistry compared to zirconium hydrides. The catalytic properties of thorium hydrides are often characterized by their ability to activate C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to hydrogenolysis, chain walking, and alkane metathesis reactions. Hydrogenolysis typically involves the breaking of C-H bonds, while chain walking refers to the sequential movement of alkyl groups along the surface of the catalyst. Alkane metathesis is facilitated through a mechanism where the thorium center coordinates alkyl groups, allowing for the exchange between the substrate and the catalyst.

The reaction rates and selectivities in these processes vary significantly between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides often exhibit higher reaction rates due to the enhanced surface functionality, which promotes efficient adsorption and activation of substrates. Selectivity, however, might be lower as the complex structure allows for multiple pathways of reaction. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides tend to have lower reaction rates but potentially higher selectivity, as the simpler structure might restrict the number of reactive sites, thereby enhancing specificity towards desired products.

Both catalysts utilize mechanisms such as hydrogenolysis, chain walking, and alkane metathesis in their respective activation processes. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides leverage the intricate surface interactions for a broader range of applications, whereas alumina-supported thorium hydrides excel in processes requiring high selectivity and potentially lower reaction rates.

In conclusion, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct catalytic properties, structures, and mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions, with zirconium hydrides offering higher reactivity and potentially lower selectivity, while thorium hydrides demonstrate higher selectivity but possibly lower reactivity.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，可以发现它们具有不同的特征。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物通常展现出更复杂的结构，由于锆与二氧化硅之间的相互作用导致表面功能多样，这使得它们具备广泛的催化活性，包括H/D交换和烷烃互变异构。H/D交换机制涉及初始的烯烃氧化插入，随后是通过脱氘原子的还原消除生成的乙烯基。烷烃互变异构则通过σ键互变异构机制发生，其中锆中心促进烷基团在催化剂和烷烃底物之间的交换。

另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物表现出更为简单的结构，主要是由于支撑材料（氧化铝）的性质。钍氢化物层在氧化铝支持上的表面化学与锆氢化物不同。钍氢化物的催化特性通常表现为激活烷烃中的C-H键，导致氢解、链行走和烷烃互变异构反应。氢解通常涉及C-H键的断裂，而链行走指的是烷基团沿催化剂表面的连续移动。烷烃互变异构则是通过钍中心协调烷基团，允许底物和催化剂之间的烷基团交换来实现的。

这些过程中的反应速率和选择性在二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物之间存在显著差异。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物往往显示出更高的反应速率，由于其复杂的结构促进了高效的吸附和底物活化。然而，选择性可能较低，因为复杂的结构允许多种反应途径。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物倾向于具有较低的反应速率但可能更高的选择性，因为较简单的结构可能限制了活性位点的数量，从而增强对目标产物的特异性。

两种催化剂均利用氢解、链行走和烷烃互变异构等机制在其各自的激活过程中发挥作用。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物通过复杂的表面相互作用提供了更广泛的用途，而氧化铝支持的钍氢化物则在需要高选择性和可能较低反应速率的应用中表现出色。

综上所述，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的催化性质、结构和机制方面具有明显的差异，其中锆氢化物表现出较高的活性和可能较低的选择性，而钍氢化物则在选择性和可能较低的反应速率方面表现出色。

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, it can be noted that both materials serve as supports for the metal hydrides, facilitating their use in catalytic processes. Silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) provide a stable, non-reactive support structure for the metal hydrides, allowing them to be employed in various reactions.

In terms of preparation, the metal hydrides are typically synthesized separately and then loaded onto the support material through impregnation or other methods. The choice of support material can influence the reaction conditions and the activity of the catalyst. For instance, silica is known for its high surface area and good thermal stability, while alumina can affect the acidity of the support, potentially influencing the reaction mechanism.

Structure-wise, the metal hydrides themselves are crucial. Zirconium hydrides and thorium hydrides have distinct structures and reactivities. Zirconium hydrides are known for their ability to activate C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Thorium hydrides, on the other hand, might exhibit different reactivity profiles due to the different electronic properties of thorium compared to zirconium.

Catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions are influenced by factors such as reaction rate, selectivity, and the mechanism of activation. For silica-supported zirconium hydrides, the high surface area of silica enables efficient adsorption and activation of alkanes, leading to rapid H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The zirconium hydride component facilitates the breaking and formation of C-H bonds, which is essential for these processes.

For alumina-supported thorium hydrides, the alumina support might alter the reaction kinetics or selectivity due to its acidic properties, which could affect the stability of the metal hydride or the energetics of the activation process. The thorium hydride would likely have a different reactivity profile compared to zirconium, potentially leading to different reaction pathways or product distributions.

Reaction rates in these systems are typically influenced by the surface area of the support, the loading of the metal hydride, and the specific reaction conditions. Selectivity can be tuned through the choice of support, metal hydride, and reaction parameters, aiming for controlled product distributions.

Mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking play crucial roles in these processes. σ-bond metathesis involves the rearrangement of π bonds, which can lead to the formation of new alkene products. Hydrogenolysis involves the cleavage of C-H bonds by hydrogen, which is a common step in H/D exchange reactions. Chain walking describes the movement of a reactive center along a polymer chain, affecting the sequence of products formed.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides offer distinct catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions, influenced by the choice of support material, metal hydride, and reaction conditions. The mechanisms of activation, including σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, contribute to the efficiency and selectivity of these processes.

在准备方面，通常分别合成金属氢化物，然后通过浸渍或其他方法加载到支撑材料上。选择支撑材料可能会影响反应条件和催化剂的活性。例如，二氧化硅因其高比表面积和良好的热稳定性而知名，而氧化铝可能会影响支持的酸性，可能影响反应机制。

从结构上看，金属氢化物本身至关重要。锆氢化物和钍氢化物具有不同的结构和反应性。锆氢化物已知能够激活烷烃中的C-H键，导致H/D交换和烷烃的重排。相比之下，钍氢化物由于钍与锆的不同电子特性，其活性特性可能有所不同。

在C-H键活化反应中的催化性质受到反应速率、选择性和激活机制的影响。对于二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物，二氧化硅的高比表面积允许有效吸附和激活烷烃，从而实现快速的H/D交换和烷烃重排。锆氢化物成分有助于C-H键的断裂和形成，这是这些过程的关键。

对于氧化铝支持的钍氢化物，氧化铝支持可能改变反应动力学或选择性，因为其酸性性质可能影响金属氢化物的稳定性或激活过程的能量。钍氢化物可能具有不同于锆的反应性轮廓，可能导致不同的反应途径或产品分布。

反应速率在这些系统中通常受支持材料的比表面积、金属氢化物的负载量以及特定反应条件的影响。选择性可以通过选择支持材料、金属氢化物和反应参数来调整，以控制产物分布。

σ-键互换、氢解离和链行走等机制在这些过程中起着关键作用。σ-键互换涉及π键的重组，可能导致新烯烃产品的形成。氢解离涉及由氢裂解C-H键，这通常是H/D交换反应中的常见步骤。链行走描述了活性中心沿聚合物链的移动，影响所形成的产物序列。

综上所述，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中提供了独特的催化性质，受到支持材料的选择、金属氢化物和反应条件的影响。激活机制，包括σ-键互换、氢解离和链行走，对这些过程的效率和选择性产生了影响。

[2] "This difference is paralleled by differences in the thermodynamics of the reaction,and therefore may be related to the affinity of the different surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Also, the elimination of a deuterium atom from an ethyl group is about 10 times slower than the elimination of a normal hydrogen on either C  ( 1 0 0 ) or Fe(lOO)lOz surfaces;since normal primary isotope effects can at the most account for a factor of 5,the remaining difference must be due either to tunneling or to secondary effects."
[3] "Some other signilicant trends have been observed (1) The desorption temperature of alkenes from alkyl groups on Ni(100) shifts to higher temperature with increasing chain length,perhaps because of the increase in adsorption energy of the pr0ducts.4 (2) Branched alkyls yield more alkenes than linear ones (relative to the alkane produced by the competing reductive elimination reaction), and they do so at lower temperatures. This effect can be explained at least in part by steric and entropic arguments."

1. The elimination of hydrogen atoms from 3-hexyl groups is faster on Cu(100) compared to cyclohexyl groups, indicating that molecular strain affects the reaction rate. This suggests a cyclic transition state might be involved. For isobutyl decomposition on aluminum surfaces, a four-center planar intermediate is favored. The activation barrier for the elimination reaction varies from 24 to 37 kcaVmol on aluminum, but is less than 10 kcaVmol on most transition metals. The difference in reactivity between surfaces is paralleled by differences in thermodynamics and hydrogen affinity. Eliminating deuterium from an ethyl group is about 10 times slower than eliminating a normal hydrogen on surfaces like Cu(100) or Fe(lOO), beyond what primary isotope effects can explain, possibly due to tunneling or secondary effects.

2. The desorption temperature of alkenes from alkyl groups on Ni(100) increases with longer alkyl chain lengths, likely due to higher adsorption energy of products. Branched alkyls produce more alkenes than linear ones at lower temperatures, which can be explained by steric and entropic considerations.

1. 3-己基团在Cu(100)上的氢消除速率比环己基团快，这表明分子张力会影响反应速率。这可能暗示存在一个循环过渡态。对于铝表面上的异丁基分解，倾向于形成一个四个中心的平面中间体。消除反应的活化能范围从铝表面的24到37 kcaVmol，但在大多数过渡金属表面低于10 kcaVmol。不同表面的反应性差异与热力学和氢亲和力的变化相平行。从Cu(100)或Fe(lOO)表面去除脱氘氢原子的速度是正常氢原子的10倍，超出了一般初级同位素效应所能解释的范围，可能是由于隧穿或次级效应。

2. Ni(100)表面上，随着烷基链长的增长，烯烃从烷基的脱附温度升高，这可能是因为产物的吸附能增加。支链烷基相对于竞争的还原消除反应生成更多的烯烃，并且在较低温度下实现。这种效应至少部分可以由立体化学和熵考虑来解释。

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides exhibit distinct properties in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides facilitate H/D exchange reactions with high rates and selectivity, as evidenced by the efficient conversion of alkanes to their deuterated counterparts. The mechanism typically involves σ-bond metathesis, where the hydride ion abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of a zirconium hydride complex that then facilitates the exchange reaction.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are more effective in alkane metathesis reactions, primarily through hydrogenolysis and chain walking mechanisms. These processes involve the cleavage of C-H bonds and the subsequent rearrangement of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of new alkane isomers. Thorium hydrides' unique acidic properties enable them to promote these reactions with high efficiency and selectivity, making them suitable for applications requiring the transformation of alkanes into desired isomers.

Both types of hydrides rely on the activation of C-H bonds to initiate the desired chemical transformations. The selectivity and rate of these reactions are influenced by factors such as the nature of the support material, the presence of acid sites, and the specific properties of the metal hydride. The anionic nature of the leaving hydrogen in p-hydride eliminations, demonstrated through fluorine-substituted propyl groups on copper surfaces, plays a crucial role in these mechanisms. The stabilization of the positive charge on the 8 carbon by alkyl groups accelerates the reaction, indicating the importance of electron-donating groups in enhancing the activity of these catalysts.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides excel in H/D exchange reactions due to their efficient σ-bond metathesis capabilities, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides are more adept at alkane metathesis through hydrogenolysis and chain walking mechanisms. The selectivity and rate of these reactions are influenced by various factors, including the properties of the catalyst and the specific reaction conditions.

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation, the preparation methods differ significantly. Silica-supported catalysts are typically created through sol-gel processes with zirconium alkoxides and silanes, while alumina-supported catalysts are synthesized using hydrothermal methods with thorium compounds and alumina precursors. 

Silica supports offer higher activity in C-H bond activation due to the better dispersion of zirconium species, whereas alumina provides better stability for thorium hydrides, enhancing selectivity in H/D exchange reactions. The H/D exchange mechanism involves activating hydrogen atoms by the metal hydride, which then transfers to the carbon atom. For alkane metathesis, the catalysts enable the exchange of alkyl groups, requiring high activation and coordination. 

Silica-supported catalysts generally exhibit faster reaction rates due to more efficient substrate access, while alumina-supported catalysts have slower rates but higher selectivity. σ-bond metathesis is crucial in alkane metathesis, facilitating the rearrangement of alkyl groups. Hydrogenolysis contributes to the H/D exchange process, enabling the formation of deuterated products. Chain walking in C-H bond activation improves reaction efficiency by allowing the catalyst to move along the carbon chain.

The selection of silica or alumina as a support material depends on achieving a desired balance between activity and selectivity in the reaction.
