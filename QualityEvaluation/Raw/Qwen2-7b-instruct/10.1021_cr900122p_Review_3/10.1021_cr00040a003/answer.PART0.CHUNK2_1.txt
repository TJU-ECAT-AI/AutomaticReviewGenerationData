The literature discusses various aspects of ethylene hydrogenation on metal surfaces. It mentions that ethylene self-hydrogenates at around 300 K under saturation coverages on Pt(ll1) surfaces, yielding ethane at a low yield of a few percent. The reaction is observed on Ni(ll1) under high pressures and on Pd(ll1) in molecular beam studies at room temperature. However, no ethane formation from adsorbed ethylene has been observed on nickel, palladium, rhodium, or ruthenium surfaces. Ethylene hydrogenation involves a stepwise mechanism, starting with the migratory insertion of ethylene into a metal-hydrogen bond followed by reductive elimination of the resulting alkyl intermediate with a second coordinated hydrogen atom. The activation energies for these steps are approximately 13 kcal/mol for ethyl formation and 5 kcal/mol for ethane desorption on Pt(111), while on Ni(100) surfaces, these values are around 10 kcal/mol and less than 5 kcal/mol, respectively. Ethylene can also form from acetylene, a reaction observed specifically on palladium surfaces. Ethylene is produced on Pd(100) and Pd(lll) but not on Pd(110) surfaces. Hydrogen coadsorption enhances the production of hydrogenated compounds, including ethylene, on various surfaces. The literature suggests that hydrogen mobility plays a crucial role in determining the rate of the overall hydrogenation process in crowded substrate environments.

文献讨论了金属表面乙烯氢化的一些方面。文献提到，乙烯在约300 K时，在Pt(ll1)表面上通过饱和覆盖度自我氢化，产生少量的乙烷。在Ni(ll1)表面在高压下和在室温下的分子束研究中观察到乙烯氢化。然而，在镍、钯、铑或钌表面上没有观察到从吸附的乙烯产生乙烷。乙烯氢化涉及一个分步机制，开始于乙烯插入金属-氢键中的迁移插入，然后是生成的烷基中间体与第二个配位氢原子的还原消除。在Pt(111)表面上，这些步骤的活化能大约为13 kcal/mol和5 kcal/mol，而Ni(100)表面上分别为10 kcal/mol和小于5 kcal/mol。乙烯也可以从丙烯酸形成，这是在钯表面上观察到的一种反应。乙烯在Pd(100)和Pd(lll)上产生但不在Pd(110)上产生。氢共沉积增强了各种表面上氢化物的产生，包括乙烯。文献表明，氢的流动性在拥挤的基质环境中对整体氢化过程的速率起着关键作用。
