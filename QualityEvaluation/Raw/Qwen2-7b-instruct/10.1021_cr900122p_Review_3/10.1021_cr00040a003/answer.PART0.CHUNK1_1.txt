[1] "The activation of C-H bonds in reductive elimination reactions is determined by the overall thermodynamics of the system, and therefore depends on the relative stability of the product (an A-B molecule) compared to that of the initial reactant (a M(A)(B) complex)."
[2] "The reductive elimination of either an alkyl and a hydride or two alkyl groups is exothermic: elimination of methane from Pt(PH3)2(CH3)H,for instance, releases an estimated 19 kcal/mol at room temperature."
[3] "Reductive elimination from dialkyl mono-metallic complexes is known to yield alkane products."
[4] "The mechanism of this reaction is still not well understood, but the fact that only normal isobutene is formed even when starting with 1,l-dideuterioneopentyl iodide indicates that the bond that breaks is that between the a and β carbons."
[5] "Ethyl groups couple with high efficiency on Au(100) or Au(ll1) surfaces unless sites are blocked by other ligands."
[6] "The conversion of methyl to methylene groups was clearly established on Pt(ll1) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS)."
[7] "The mechanism for this reaction is far from resolved. Two routes have been extensively discussed in the literature, the direct hydrogen slippage from one carbon to the next, and the two-step conversion via an alkynyl intermediate."
[8] "The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on platinum yields cyclohexene."
[9] "The mechanism of this reaction is more complicated than initially thought. For example, a recent STM study has shown that the kinetics for the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(ll1) may depend on the availability of the appropriate ensemble of metal atoms."
[10] "The conversion of acetylene to ethylene on Ni(lll) is believed to follow a multistep mechanism that includes a 1,2 hydrogen-shift step."

1. The stability of the product versus the reactant determines the activation of C-H bonds in reductive elimination reactions. 
2. Reductive elimination reactions involving alkyl groups and hydrides are exothermic, releasing 19 kcal/mol for the elimination of methane from Pt(PH3)2(CH3)H.
3. Reductive elimination from dialkyl mono-metallic complexes typically results in alkane formation.
4. The bond between the α and β carbons is the one that breaks in the reductive elimination of isobutene, even when starting with dideuterioneopentyl iodide.
5. Ethyl groups efficiently couple with Au(100) or Au(ll1) surfaces unless sites are blocked by other ligands.
6. RAIRS clearly establishes the conversion of methyl to methylene on Pt(ll1) surfaces.
7. The isomerization of acetylene to ethylidyne involves either direct hydrogen slippage or a two-step conversion via an alkynyl intermediate.
8. The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on platinum surfaces yields cyclohexene.
9. The kinetics for the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(ll1) depends on the availability of the appropriate metal atom ensemble.

1. 系统的整体热力学决定了C-H键在还原消除反应中的激活，产物（AB分子）与初始反应物（M（A）（B）复合物）的相对稳定性决定了这一点。
2. 包括甲烷从Pt（PH3）2（CH3）H的消除在内的还原消除反应是放热的，室温下释放大约19 kcal/mol的能量。
3. 双烷基单金属复合物的还原消除通常导致烷烃的形成。
4. 即使从dideuterioneopentyl碘开始，只有正常异丁烯形成时，表明断裂的是α和β碳之间的键。
5. 除非表面被其他配体阻塞，否则乙基组在Au(100)或Au(ll1)表面上高效耦合。
6. RAIRS清楚地证明了在Pt(ll1)表面上甲基转化为甲基化。
7. 丙炔转化为乙基化涉及直接氢滑移或通过一个丙炔中间体的两步转换。
