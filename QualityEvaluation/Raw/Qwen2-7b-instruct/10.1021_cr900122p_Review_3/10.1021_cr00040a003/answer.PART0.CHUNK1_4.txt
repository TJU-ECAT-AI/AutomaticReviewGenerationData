[2] "This difference is paralleled by differences in the thermodynamics of the reaction,and therefore may be related to the affinity of the different surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Also, the elimination of a deuterium atom from an ethyl group is about 10 times slower than the elimination of a normal hydrogen on either C  ( 1 0 0 ) or Fe(lOO)lOz surfaces;since normal primary isotope effects can at the most account for a factor of 5,the remaining difference must be due either to tunneling or to secondary effects."
[3] "Some other signilicant trends have been observed (1) The desorption temperature of alkenes from alkyl groups on Ni(100) shifts to higher temperature with increasing chain length,perhaps because of the increase in adsorption energy of the pr0ducts.4 (2) Branched alkyls yield more alkenes than linear ones (relative to the alkane produced by the competing reductive elimination reaction), and they do so at lower temperatures. This effect can be explained at least in part by steric and entropic arguments."

1. The elimination of hydrogen atoms from 3-hexyl groups is faster on Cu(100) compared to cyclohexyl groups, indicating that molecular strain affects the reaction rate. This suggests a cyclic transition state might be involved. For isobutyl decomposition on aluminum surfaces, a four-center planar intermediate is favored. The activation barrier for the elimination reaction varies from 24 to 37 kcaVmol on aluminum, but is less than 10 kcaVmol on most transition metals. The difference in reactivity between surfaces is paralleled by differences in thermodynamics and hydrogen affinity. Eliminating deuterium from an ethyl group is about 10 times slower than eliminating a normal hydrogen on surfaces like Cu(100) or Fe(lOO), beyond what primary isotope effects can explain, possibly due to tunneling or secondary effects.

2. The desorption temperature of alkenes from alkyl groups on Ni(100) increases with longer alkyl chain lengths, likely due to higher adsorption energy of products. Branched alkyls produce more alkenes than linear ones at lower temperatures, which can be explained by steric and entropic considerations.

1. 3-己基团在Cu(100)上的氢消除速率比环己基团快，这表明分子张力会影响反应速率。这可能暗示存在一个循环过渡态。对于铝表面上的异丁基分解，倾向于形成一个四个中心的平面中间体。消除反应的活化能范围从铝表面的24到37 kcaVmol，但在大多数过渡金属表面低于10 kcaVmol。不同表面的反应性差异与热力学和氢亲和力的变化相平行。从Cu(100)或Fe(lOO)表面去除脱氘氢原子的速度是正常氢原子的10倍，超出了一般初级同位素效应所能解释的范围，可能是由于隧穿或次级效应。

2. Ni(100)表面上，随着烷基链长的增长，烯烃从烷基的脱附温度升高，这可能是因为产物的吸附能增加。支链烷基相对于竞争的还原消除反应生成更多的烯烃，并且在较低温度下实现。这种效应至少部分可以由立体化学和熵考虑来解释。
