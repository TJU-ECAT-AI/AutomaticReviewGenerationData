[1] "The silica-supported complex 1 was prepared by using the literature procedure."
[2] "The well-defined Recarbene supported on silica is a highly active olefin metathesis catalyst even for functionalised olefins."
[3] "This system is highly active for terminal and internal olefins with initial rates up to 0.7 mol per mol Re per s."
[4] "It also catalyses the self-metathesis of methyl oleate (MO) without the need of co-catalysts."
[5] "The turnover numbers can reach up to 900 for MO, which is unprecedented for a heterogeneous Re-based catalyst."
[6] "The recent improvements of the Ru-based systems have been outstanding,5, 17 and this well-defined Re-based system supported on silica is probably a first step towards the rational development of highly active and functional group compatible heterogeneous catalysts by a molecular approach of the construction of the active site."

The document discusses the preparation and catalytic properties of a well-defined rhenium carbene complex supported on silica. This complex is highly active in olefin metathesis reactions, capable of converting both terminal and internal olefins at high rates. It catalyzes the self-metathesis of methyl oleate without requiring a co-catalyst and achieves unprecedented turnover numbers for a heterogeneous rhenium-based catalyst. The complex is also noted for its ability to convert ester-containing olefins, a challenge for both homogeneous and heterogeneous rhenium-based catalysts. The silica support brings advantages, such as compatibility with branched olefins, leading to reactions like the cross-metathesis of propene and isobutene. Compared to other silica- or alumina-supported rhenium oxide systems, this catalyst shows superior reactivity and selectivity, making it a significant advancement in the field of heterogeneous catalysts.

文档讨论了一种在硅酸盐上支持的定义明确的铼碳烯复合物的制备和催化性质。这种复合物在烯烃互变异构反应中表现出高度活性，能够高效地转换终端和内部烯烃。它能够催化甲基醇酸的自我互变异构，无需辅助催化剂，并且实现了对于异构化催化剂前所未有的高周转数。该复合物还表现出对酯基含有的烯烃的转化能力，这是均相和异相铼基催化剂难以实现的挑战。硅酸盐的支持带来了优势，如与分支烯烃的兼容性，导致了如丙烯和异丁烯的交叉互变异构反应。与其它基于二氧化硅或氧化铝的铼氧化物系统相比，此催化剂在活性和选择性方面表现更优，是异相催化剂理性开发的重要一步，通过分子方法构建活性位点。
