[1] "The silica-supported complex 1 was prepared by using the literature procedure."
[2] "The complex 1 (20.4 μmol, 80 mg, 4.75%wt Re) was introduced under Ar in a 381 mL batch reactor."
[3] "The well-defined Recarbene supported on silica is a highly active olefin metathesis catalyst even for functionalised olefins."
[4] "Moreover this surface complex 1 readily converts ester-containing olefins without the need for a co-catalyst(s); this is a challenge that has been difficult so far for both homogenous and heterogeneous Re-based catalysts."
[5] "The recent improvements of the Ru-based systems have been outstanding,5, 17 and this well-defined Re-based system supported on silica is probably a first step towards the rational development of highly active and functional group compatible heterogeneous catalysts by a molecular approach of the construction of the active site."

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported rhenium carbene complexes for olefin metathesis. The complex 1, a well-defined rhenium alkylidene supported on silica, is highly active in olefin metathesis reactions, particularly for terminal and internal olefins. It is capable of self-metathesis of methyl oleate without the need for a co-catalyst. The catalyst has a turnover number reaching up to 900 for methyl oleate, which is unprecedented for a heterogeneous rhenium-based catalyst. The use of silica as a support offers advantages, allowing the use of branched olefins like isobutene, which are usually incompatible with alumina-based supports. The formation of isoamylene from the cross-metathesis of propene and isobutene can be performed using this catalyst. The document also mentions that the recent improvements in rhenium-based systems have been significant, and this silica-supported rhenium system represents a step towards the rational development of highly active and functional group compatible heterogeneous catalysts.

文档讨论了用于烯烃环化裂解的二氧化硅支持的铑碳烯复合物的制备、结构和催化性质。复合物1，一种在二氧化硅上的定义明确的铑烷基二烯，对烯烃环化裂解反应具有高度活性，特别是对于终端和内部烯烃。它能够在没有辅助催化剂的情况下自我环化甲氧基酸酯。该催化剂的甲氧基酸酯的周转数可达到900，这是迄今为止异质铑基催化剂中的最高值。使用二氧化硅作为支撑物提供了优势，允许使用如异丁烯等支链烯烃，这通常与氧化铝基支持物不兼容。异己烯可以通过接触丙烯和异丁烯来形成，使用此催化剂进行交叉环化。文档还提到，最近在铑基系统方面的改进非常显著，并且这种二氧化硅支持的铑系统代表了向理性发展高度活性和功能团兼容的异质催化剂的第一步。
