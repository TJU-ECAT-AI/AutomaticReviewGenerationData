The preparation of the complex 1 involved introducing it into a batch reactor under argon. The complex was placed in reactors of varying sizes, from 5 mL to 381 mL, equipped with magnetic stirring bars. For the metathesis of methyl oleate, a solution containing the complex and methyl oleate was prepared, degassed, and dried. The surface complex 1 was also placed in a 5 mL batch reactor for certain reactions.
