Answer: The silica-supported rhenium alkylidene complex demonstrates exceptional activity in olefin metathesis, particularly for terminal and internal olefins. It exhibits initial rates up to 0.7 mol per mol Re per second and can catalyze the self-metathesis of methyl oleate without requiring a co-catalyst. The turnover numbers for methyl oleate reach unprecedented levels, surpassing 900, which is significantly higher than previously reported values for similar catalysts. The use of silica as a support provides unique advantages, enabling the utilization of branched olefins like isobutene, which are incompatible with alumina-based supports. This system can perform the cross-metathesis of propene and isobutene to form isoamylene. In contrast to other silica- or alumina-supported rhenium oxide systems, this catalyst shows remarkable activity, even for functionalized olefins, without the need for co-catalysts. The complex acts as a first-generation well-defined rhenium-based heterogeneous catalyst, featuring a 3:1 mixture of 3,3-dimethylbutene and trans-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene in the initiation step.

该二氧化硅支持的铼烷二烯复合物在烯烃环化反应中表现出极高的活性，特别是对于终端和内部烯烃。它能够以每摩尔铼每秒高达0.7摩尔的速度催化反应，并且可以催化甲基烯烃的自环化反应，而无需使用共催化剂。甲基烯烃的周转数达到前所未有的900以上，远高于类似催化剂的已知值。使用二氧化硅作为载体提供独特优势，允许使用与氧化铝基催化剂不兼容的支链烯烃，如异丁烯。该系统可以执行丙烯和异丁烯的交叉环化反应形成异戊烯。与其他二氧化硅或氧化铝支持的铼氧化物系统相比，这种催化剂对功能化的烯烃显示出显著的活性，即使在需要共催化剂的情况下也是如此。复合物在起始步骤中表现为一个交叉环化反应，产生3,3-二甲基丁烯和反式4,4-二甲基戊-2-烯的1:3混合物，使其成为第一代定义明确的铼基异质催化剂。
