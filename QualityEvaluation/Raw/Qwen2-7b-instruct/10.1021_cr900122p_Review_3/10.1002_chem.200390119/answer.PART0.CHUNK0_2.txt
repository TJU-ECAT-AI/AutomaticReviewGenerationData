The literature discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported rhenium alkylidene complexes in olefin metathesis reactions. The complex 1, supported on silica, shows high activity in both terminal and internal olefin metathesis, with initial rates reaching up to 0.7 mol per mol Re per second. The turnover numbers can reach up to 900 for methyl oleate, which is unprecedented for a heterogeneous rhenium-based catalyst. The use of silica as a support provides advantages, including the capability to utilize branched olefins like isobutene, which are incompatible with alumina-based supports. The catalyst can efficiently convert ester-containing olefins without requiring a co-catalyst.

文献讨论了在烯烃环化反应中，以二氧化硅为载体的铼烷基双键复合物的制备、结构和催化性质。复合物1，被固定在二氧化硅上，显示出了在终端和内部烯烃环化中的高活性，初始速率可达每摩尔Re每秒0.7摩尔。对于甲基癸酸酯，其周转数可以达到900，这是异相铼基催化剂前所未有的水平。使用二氧化硅作为支持提供了优势，包括能够利用如异丁烯这样的支链烯烃，这些烯烃通常与氧化铝基支持不兼容。该催化剂能够有效地将酯类含有的烯烃转化为产物，而无需辅助催化剂。
