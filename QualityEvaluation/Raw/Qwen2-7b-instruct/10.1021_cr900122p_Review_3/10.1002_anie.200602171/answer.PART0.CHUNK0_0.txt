[1] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[2] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."
[3] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
[4] "Note that this well-defined catalyst precursor achieves about the same TON (55) in 120 h as the original tantalum hydride catalyst supported on silica (TON=60) despite the presence of ancillary ligands."
[5] "This finding is in contrast to that observed for Ta-based catalysts, for which an equimolar mixture of methane and propane is obtained from ethane; however, it consistent with the absence of methane in the metathesis of other alkanes (propane and butane)."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides both play significant roles in C-H bond activation reactions. However, the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these two catalysts differ notably. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides, utilized in the 1997 study, are effective in alkane metathesis reactions, converting a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. These catalysts exhibit a constant turnover frequency for 40 hours and achieve a comparable turnover number (TON) in 120 hours compared to the original tantalum hydride catalyst, demonstrating their efficiency and stability. The catalytic process involves π-bond metathesis, where an olefin interacts with a carbene, acting as a key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and forming step. Ancillary ligands are compatible with this system, enhancing its versatility.

On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are less explored in the context of C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in alkane metathesis. They are not mentioned in the provided literature regarding their application in such reactions or their specific properties. However, they could potentially offer different catalytic characteristics due to the nature of the support material (alumina) and the metal used (thorium). 

In terms of mechanism, the reactions involving these catalysts might include H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, and alkane cross-metathesis. σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are integral components of these processes. The rates of these reactions, selectivity, and the specific roles of these mechanisms would depend on the detailed conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the specific catalyst composition. The literature highlights the importance of ancillary ligands in enhancing catalyst performance and suggests that they can be used effectively in the context of silica-supported molybdenum complexes for alkane metathesis. 

Comparatively, the silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst demonstrates a high degree of selectivity and efficiency in alkane metathesis, whereas the alumina-supported thorium hydride's potential applications in C-H bond activation remain unspecified in the provided document. The literature focuses on the silica-supported molybdenum complex's ability to catalyze alkane metathesis, emphasizing the importance of ancillary ligands in achieving high turnover numbers without compromising selectivity.

在C-H键激活反应中，二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物都扮演着重要角色。然而，这两种催化剂的制备、结构和催化性质存在显著差异。1997年的研究中使用的二氧化硅支持的锆化物在烷烃裂合反应中表现出色，可以将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高同系物。这些催化剂在40小时内具有恒定的周转频率，并在120小时内与原始钽化物催化剂相比实现了相似的周转数（TON），这表明它们的效率和稳定性。催化过程涉及π键裂合，即烯烃与碳烯相互作用，作为碳-碳键断裂和形成的关键步骤。辅助配体与这个系统兼容，提高了其灵活性。

另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应，特别是烷烃裂合中的应用较少提及。在提供的文献中没有详细说明这些催化剂的具体性质或应用。然而，由于所使用的支撑材料（氧化铝）和金属（钍）的性质，它们可能提供不同的催化特性。 

在机制方面，这些催化剂的反应可能包括H/D交换、烷烃裂合和烷烃交叉裂合。σ键裂合、氢解和链行走是这些过程的组成部分。这些反应的速度、选择性和特定机制取决于具体条件，包括温度、压力和催化剂的组成。文献强调了辅助配体在提高催化剂性能方面的有效性，并指出它们可以有效地用于二氧化硅支持的钼复合物中的烷烃裂合。 

比较而言，二氧化硅支持的锆化物催化剂在烷烃裂合中显示出高度的选择性和效率，而氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活中的潜在应用在提供的文档中尚未明确说明。文献重点介绍了二氧化硅支持的钼复合物能够催化烷烃裂合的能力，强调了辅助配体在实现高周转数的同时保持选择性的关键作用。
