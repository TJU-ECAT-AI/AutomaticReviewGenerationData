Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides both play significant roles in C-H bond activation reactions. However, the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these two catalysts differ notably. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides, utilized in the 1997 study, are effective in alkane metathesis reactions, converting a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. These catalysts exhibit a constant turnover frequency for 40 hours and achieve a comparable turnover number (TON) in 120 hours compared to the original tantalum hydride catalyst, demonstrating their efficiency and stability. The catalytic process involves π-bond metathesis, where an olefin interacts with a carbene, acting as a key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and forming step. Ancillary ligands are compatible with this system, enhancing its versatility.

On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are less explored in the context of C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in alkane metathesis. They are not mentioned in the provided literature regarding their application in such reactions or their specific properties. However, they could potentially offer different catalytic characteristics due to the nature of the support material (alumina) and the metal used (thorium). 

In terms of mechanism, the reactions involving these catalysts might include H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, and alkane cross-metathesis. σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking are integral components of these processes. The rates of these reactions, selectivity, and the specific roles of these mechanisms would depend on the detailed conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the specific catalyst composition. The literature highlights the importance of ancillary ligands in enhancing catalyst performance and suggests that they can be used effectively in the context of silica-supported molybdenum complexes for alkane metathesis. 

Comparatively, the silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst demonstrates a high degree of selectivity and efficiency in alkane metathesis, whereas the alumina-supported thorium hydride's potential applications in C-H bond activation remain unspecified in the provided document. The literature focuses on the silica-supported molybdenum complex's ability to catalyze alkane metathesis, emphasizing the importance of ancillary ligands in achieving high turnover numbers without compromising selectivity.

在C-H键激活反应中，二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物都扮演着重要角色。然而，这两种催化剂的制备、结构和催化性质存在显著差异。1997年的研究中使用的二氧化硅支持的锆化物在烷烃裂合反应中表现出色，可以将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高同系物。这些催化剂在40小时内具有恒定的周转频率，并在120小时内与原始钽化物催化剂相比实现了相似的周转数（TON），这表明它们的效率和稳定性。催化过程涉及π键裂合，即烯烃与碳烯相互作用，作为碳-碳键断裂和形成的关键步骤。辅助配体与这个系统兼容，提高了其灵活性。

另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应，特别是烷烃裂合中的应用较少提及。在提供的文献中没有详细说明这些催化剂的具体性质或应用。然而，由于所使用的支撑材料（氧化铝）和金属（钍）的性质，它们可能提供不同的催化特性。 

在机制方面，这些催化剂的反应可能包括H/D交换、烷烃裂合和烷烃交叉裂合。σ键裂合、氢解和链行走是这些过程的组成部分。这些反应的速度、选择性和特定机制取决于具体条件，包括温度、压力和催化剂的组成。文献强调了辅助配体在提高催化剂性能方面的有效性，并指出它们可以有效地用于二氧化硅支持的钼复合物中的烷烃裂合。 

比较而言，二氧化硅支持的锆化物催化剂在烷烃裂合中显示出高度的选择性和效率，而氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活中的潜在应用在提供的文档中尚未明确说明。文献重点介绍了二氧化硅支持的钼复合物能够催化烷烃裂合的能力，强调了辅助配体在实现高周转数的同时保持选择性的关键作用。

[2] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
[3] "Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2)."
[4] "Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction)."
[5] "This model is also consistent with the observed product selectivity and explains the greater selectivity of butane relative to that of pentane when starting from 1c (R=R=Et) and when the cross-metathesis of the resulting propagating alkylidene hydride intermediate 2b (X=H, R=Et) and propene is involved."
[6] "Therefore, the propagation step is probably hindered by the olefin-metathesis step, which would require a disfavored [2+2] cycloaddition between a disubstituted carbene and a disubstituted olefin."

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, we find that both types of catalysts play crucial roles in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. However, the specific mechanisms and outcomes differ.

Silica-supported molybdenum complexes, such as [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], are highly active in olefin metathesis. These complexes act as catalyst precursors for alkane metathesis due to their dual functionality, allowing for the transformation of alkanes into lower and higher homologues. Ancillary ligands, like imido groups, can be used in these systems, demonstrating their versatility in catalysis. The turnover frequency is constant for 40 hours, indicating stable performance, but there is a reproducible decrease in conversion thereafter. The selectivity of the products suggests that π-bond metathesis is the key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and-forming step. Ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides might exhibit different catalytic properties and mechanisms. Their structures and preparation methods could lead to distinct reactivity patterns compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. The document does not provide detailed comparisons of these two catalysts in C-H bond activation reactions, focusing instead on the silica-supported molybdenum complex's capabilities in alkane metathesis. The document does not explicitly discuss the mechanisms, reaction rates, or selectivity of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in these processes.

Answering the second question requires additional information beyond the provided document, as it asks for a comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in terms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The document focuses on the silica-supported molybdenum complex's capabilities and does not provide sufficient details to compare it directly with alumina-supported thorium hydrides in the specified contexts. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between the two catalyst types in the requested chemical processes cannot be derived from the available information.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，我们发现这两种催化剂在氢/氘交换和烷烃裂解中起着关键作用。然而，它们的具体机制和结果有所不同。

二氧化硅支持的钼复合物，如[(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]，在烯烃裂合中非常活跃。这些复合物作为烷烃裂解的催化剂前体，由于其双重功能，允许烷烃转化为更低和更高同系物。辅助配体，如脒基团，可以在这些系统中使用，展示了它们在催化方面的灵活性。转化频率在40小时内保持恒定，表明稳定的性能，但随后有可重复的转化率下降。产物的选择性表明π-键裂合是碳-碳键断裂和形成的步骤的关键。辅助配体与烷烃裂解反应兼容。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍化物可能在C-H键激活反应中表现出不同的催化性质。它们的结构和制备方法可能导致与二氧化硅支持的锆化物不同的反应活性模式。文档没有提供关于这两种催化剂的详细比较，而是集中在二氧化硅支持的钼复合物的烷烃裂解能力上。文档没有明确讨论在指定上下文中铝氧支持的钍化物的机制、反应速率或选择性。

回答第二个问题需要超出所提供的文档的信息，因为它要求比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在氢/氘交换和烷烃裂解中的催化性质。文档专注于二氧化硅支持的钼复合物的能力，并没有提供足够的信息直接将它们与氧化铝支持的钍化物进行此类比较。因此，从可用信息中无法得出这两种催化剂类型在请求的化学过程中的全面比较。

The document discusses a silica-supported molybdenum imido alkylidene complex (1a) as a catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis. It shows that when propane is subjected to this catalyst at 150°C, it is converted into mainly ethane, butane, small amounts of methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivity of the products is consistent over time, with a low methane yield likely due to hydrogenolysis. The catalyst precursor achieves a similar turnover number (TON) in 120 hours compared to an original tantalum hydride catalyst, demonstrating its efficiency in alkane metathesis. The document also mentions that ancillary ligands, such as alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), and chloride, have not improved catalyst performance in previous studies. In contrast, the imido ligand in 1a is compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.

In summary, the silica-supported molybdenum imido alkylidene complex (1a) is an effective catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis, showing consistent selectivity and efficiency over time. Ancillary ligands have not shown significant improvement in catalyst performance in previous studies, whereas the imido ligand in 1a facilitates alkane metathesis.

The document highlights the importance of alkane metathesis as a method for converting alkanes into lower and higher homologues, which is crucial for optimizing oil resources. The use of a well-defined catalyst precursor enables efficient alkane conversion at moderate temperatures, demonstrating the potential for practical applications in chemical synthesis.

文档讨论了一种硅支持的钼酰基烷基二烯配合物（1a）作为烷烃裂合的催化剂前体。它显示，当丙烷在150°C下与该催化剂接触时，主要转化为乙烷、丁烷以及少量的甲烷、异丁烷和戊烷。产物的选择性在时间上保持一致，甲烷的产量较低，可能由于氢解作用。该催化剂前体在120小时内达到的转化数（TON）与原始的钽氢化物催化剂相似，证明了其在烷烃裂合中的高效性。文档还提到，在先前的研究中，如烷基二烯、五甲基环戊二烯（Cp*）和氯等辅助配体并未提高催化剂性能。相比之下，1a中的酰基配体与烷烃裂合反应兼容。

综上所述，硅支持的钼酰基烷基二烯配合物（1a）是一种有效的烷烃裂合催化剂前体，显示出在时间上的稳定选择性和效率。先前的研究中，辅助配体没有显示出显著改善催化剂性能，而1a中的酰基配体则促进了烷烃裂合。

文档强调了烷烃裂合作为将烷烃转化为更低和更高同系物的方法的重要性，这对于优化石油资源至关重要。通过使用定义明确的催化剂前体，可以在温和温度下实现高效的烷烃转换，这表明在实际化学合成应用中具有潜力。

文档提到了烷烃裂合的当前研究背景，旨在通过结构反应关系研究进一步开发烷烃裂合催化剂。它展示了使用特定金属（如钼）的单金属体系的双重性质，与Goldman-Brookhart系统依赖于两种催化剂混合相比，这是一个新的发展。此外，文档首次展示了辅助配体（在这种情况下为酰基配体）可以被利用，从而为烷烃裂合催化剂的发展开辟了新途径。

Alkane Metathesis Catalyzed by a Well-Defined Silica-Supported Mo Imido Alkylidene Complex: [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] Graphical Abstract A two-functions-in-one catalyst precursor allows an olefin metathesis catalyst to be turned into an alkane metathesis catalyst. A silica-supported alkyl alkylidene molybdenum complex containing an ancillary imido ligand is a highly active olefin metathesis catalyst and also acts as a catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis. This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.
The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources.1,2 Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC).
Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1).
When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%).
Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2).
Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction).
Note that the alkane cross-metathesis products are obtained in a 3.4:1 ratio, which is very close to the ratio of olefin cross-metathesis products 3,3-dimethylbutene and (E)-4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene, obtained during the metathesis of propene on 1a (that is, 2.7:1), and this is consistent with the proposed elementary steps, and especially with olefin metathesis being the key carboncarbon bond-formation step.

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, both systems involve the utilization of metal hydrides supported on inorganic supports. In the case of silica-supported molybdenum complexes, a single metal (molybdenum) exhibits dual catalytic functions, both for olefin metathesis and alkane metathesis. Ancillary ligands, such as imido groups, enhance the compatibility of these catalysts with alkane metathesis reactions. The structure of these catalysts typically involves a metal complex covalently bound to the support material, with ancillary ligands providing additional functionality and selectivity. 

In terms of mechanisms, the conversion of alkanes involves π-bond metathesis, where olefin and carbene interact to cleave and reform carbon-carbon bonds. This process is facilitated by alkylidene hydrides acting as key intermediates. The turnover frequency (TON) indicates the efficiency of the catalyst, with a constant value for a period of time followed by a reproducible decrease in conversion. The selectivity in the formation of alkane products is influenced by the relative positions of substituents in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, minimizing steric hindrance.

In contrast, the alumina-supported thorium hydride catalysts may exhibit different reactivity patterns due to differences in metal reactivity, support effects, and possibly distinct mechanisms for H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. However, specific details regarding the preparation, structure, and detailed catalytic mechanisms of alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not provided in the excerpt. It is suggested that the study of structurereactivity relationships could further elucidate the differences in performance and selectivity between these two types of catalysts.

比较了二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。两者都利用金属氢化物在无机支持材料上的应用。在二氧化硅支持的钼复合物系统中，单一金属（钼）具有双重催化功能，既可用于烯烃环化，又可用于烷烃环化。辅助配体，如咪唑基团，增强了这些催化剂与烷烃环化的兼容性。这些催化剂的结构通常涉及金属复合物与支撑材料的共价结合，辅助配体提供了额外的功能性和选择性。

就机制而言，烷烃的转换涉及π-键环化，其中烯烃和卡宾相互作用以切断并重新形成碳-碳键。这一过程通过烷基二烯作为关键中间体得到促进。转数（TON）表示催化剂的效率，在一段时间内保持恒定，随后是可重复的转化率下降。烷基产物的选择性受在金属-环状化合物中间体中取代基相对位置的影响，以最小化立体障碍。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物催化剂可能显示出不同的反应模式，由于金属活性、支持效应的不同以及可能的H/D交换和烷烃环化机制不同。然而，关于这两种催化剂的具体制备、结构和详细催化机制的细节并未在摘录中提供。研究表明，通过研究结构-反应性关系，可以进一步阐明这两种催化剂性能和选择性的差异。

Alkane Metathesis Catalyzed by a Well-Defined Silica-Supported Mo Imido Alkylidene Complex: [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]
A two-functions-in-one catalyst precursor allows an olefin metathesis catalyst to be turned into an alkane metathesis catalyst.
This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.
When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%).
These selectivities are constant over time (see the Supporting Information), and noteworthy the selectivity in methane, probably produced by hydrogenolysis,16 is low as already observed for other Group 6 supported systems.
Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Note that this well-defined catalyst precursor achieves about the same TON (55) in 120 h as the original tantalum hydride catalyst supported on silica (TON=60) despite the presence of ancillary ligands.
The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources.
Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1).
Alkane metathesis products, 2,2-dimethylpropane (tBuCH2H; 0.82 equiv), 2,2-dimethylbutane (tBuCH2Me; 0.34 equiv), and 2,2-dimethylpentane (tBuCH2Et; 0.10 equiv) are formed within 120 h.
The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation).
Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not.
Therefore, the propagation step is probably hindered by the olefin-metathesis step, which would require a disfavored [2+2] cycloaddition between a disubstituted carbene and a disubstituted olefin.
In conclusion, the well-defined Mo/imido surface complex 1a belongs to a new type of silica-supported catalyst precursor for the metathesis of linear alkanes at moderate temperatures (150C).

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions is beyond the scope of this literature. The document focuses on a specific Mo/imido alkylidene complex supported on silica that enables alkane metathesis catalysis. It discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of this complex, particularly in terms of its ability to convert alkanes into lower and higher homologues through olefin metathesis and hydrogenolysis mechanisms. However, the document does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or zirconium hydrides, nor does it compare their activities in C-H bond activation reactions.

The document mentions that the system involving the silica-supported Mo/imido complex demonstrates dual functionality, allowing it to act both as an olefin metathesis catalyst and a catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis. It also highlights the role of ancillary ligands in facilitating alkane metathesis reactions. The selectivities in the alkane metathesis products are influenced by steric interactions, as seen in the formation of different alkane isomers. The catalyst precursor achieves comparable turnover numbers to those of other supported metal hydride catalysts, despite incorporating ancillary ligands.

The catalyst precursor, [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], converts propane into ethane, butane, and smaller quantities of methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivities in methane production, attributed to hydrogenolysis, are low compared to other Group 6 supported systems. The turnover frequency is constant for a certain period before decreasing reproducibly. The catalyst precursor achieves a similar turnover number in 120 hours to that of a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis involves π-bond metathesis, which is the key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and forming step. Ancillary ligands, such as imido groups, are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions, as demonstrated by the catalyst precursor's activity. The selectivity of alkane metathesis products is influenced by steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The catalyst precursor facilitates the conversion of butane into lower and higher homologues, along with cross-metathesis products, whereas ethane conversion is not as efficient. The catalyst's performance is consistent with optimized oil resource utilization through more efficient chemical routes.

In summary, the document provides insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of a silica-supported Mo/imido alkylidene complex specifically for alkane metathesis catalysis. It does not cover the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides or zirconium hydrides, nor does it compare their activities in C-H bond activation reactions.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质超出了本文档的范围。本文档专注于一种特定的Mo/imido烷基二烯体复合物，它支持在二氧化硅上，能够进行烷基二烯体催化。它讨论了该复合物的制备、结构和催化性能，特别是它如何通过烯烃代谢和氢解离机制将烷基转化为较低和较高同系物。然而，本文档没有提供关于氧化铝支持的钍化氢或锆化氢的信息，也没有比较它们在C-H键活化反应中的活性。

文中提到，该系统包含的二氧化硅支持的Mo/imido复合物显示出双功能特性，允许其作为烯烃代谢催化剂，并且作为烷基代谢催化剂的前体。它强调了辅助配体在促进烷基代谢反应中的作用。烷基代谢产物的选择性受到立体相互作用的影响，例如不同烷基异构体的形成。

催化剂前体在120小时内达到与二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化剂相似的转化率（55），尽管包含辅助配体。文章指出，过去几年中，低温下烷基转换引起了人们的兴趣，因为这为优化石油资源提供了更高效的化学途径。

文档描述了用于催化烷基转换的催化剂前体[(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]，它将丙烷转化为主要的乙烷（56.1%）、丁烷（35.3%）和少量的甲烷（0.1%）、异丁烷（2.7%）和戊烷（5.9%）。这些选择性在时间上保持不变（参见补充信息），值得注意的是，甲烷的选择性，可能由氢解离产生，是低的，类似于其他第6组支持系统的观察结果。此外，转化频率在40小时内保持恒定（约为1 TONh1；TON=转化次数），然后有可重复的转化减少（表1和图1）。该催化剂前体在120小时内达到与二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化剂相似的转化率（55），尽管包含了辅助配体。

烷基转换的机制涉及π-键代谢，这是碳-碳键断裂和形成的关键步骤。辅助配体，如imido基团，与烷基代谢反应兼容，如催化剂前体的活性所证明的那样。烷基代谢产物的选择性受metalla-cyclobutane中间体形成的立体相互作用的影响。催化剂前体能够高效地将丁烷转化为更低和更高同系物及其交叉代谢产物，而乙烷的转化效率则不高。催化剂的性能与优化石油资源利用通过更高效的化学途径是一致的。

综上所述，本文档提供了二氧化硅支持的Mo/imido烷基二烯体复合物用于烷基代谢催化的准备、结构和催化性质的见解。它没有覆盖氧化铝支持的钍化氢或锆化氢的制备、结构或催化性质，也没有比较它们在C-H键活化反应中的活性。
