[1] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[2] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
[3] "A silica-supported alkyl alkylidene/Mo complex containing an imido ligand (1a)15 is a good catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis (Scheme 1)."
[4] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
[5] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
[6] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
[7] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);18 that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."

The document discusses a silica-supported molybdenum imido alkylidene complex (1a) as a catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis. It shows that when propane is subjected to this catalyst at 150°C, it is converted into mainly ethane, butane, small amounts of methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivity of the products is consistent over time, with a low methane yield likely due to hydrogenolysis. The catalyst precursor achieves a similar turnover number (TON) in 120 hours compared to an original tantalum hydride catalyst, demonstrating its efficiency in alkane metathesis. The document also mentions that ancillary ligands, such as alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), and chloride, have not improved catalyst performance in previous studies. In contrast, the imido ligand in 1a is compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.

In summary, the silica-supported molybdenum imido alkylidene complex (1a) is an effective catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis, showing consistent selectivity and efficiency over time. Ancillary ligands have not shown significant improvement in catalyst performance in previous studies, whereas the imido ligand in 1a facilitates alkane metathesis.

The document highlights the importance of alkane metathesis as a method for converting alkanes into lower and higher homologues, which is crucial for optimizing oil resources. The use of a well-defined catalyst precursor enables efficient alkane conversion at moderate temperatures, demonstrating the potential for practical applications in chemical synthesis.

文档讨论了一种硅支持的钼酰基烷基二烯配合物（1a）作为烷烃裂合的催化剂前体。它显示，当丙烷在150°C下与该催化剂接触时，主要转化为乙烷、丁烷以及少量的甲烷、异丁烷和戊烷。产物的选择性在时间上保持一致，甲烷的产量较低，可能由于氢解作用。该催化剂前体在120小时内达到的转化数（TON）与原始的钽氢化物催化剂相似，证明了其在烷烃裂合中的高效性。文档还提到，在先前的研究中，如烷基二烯、五甲基环戊二烯（Cp*）和氯等辅助配体并未提高催化剂性能。相比之下，1a中的酰基配体与烷烃裂合反应兼容。

综上所述，硅支持的钼酰基烷基二烯配合物（1a）是一种有效的烷烃裂合催化剂前体，显示出在时间上的稳定选择性和效率。先前的研究中，辅助配体没有显示出显著改善催化剂性能，而1a中的酰基配体则促进了烷烃裂合。

文档强调了烷烃裂合作为将烷烃转化为更低和更高同系物的方法的重要性，这对于优化石油资源至关重要。通过使用定义明确的催化剂前体，可以在温和温度下实现高效的烷烃转换，这表明在实际化学合成应用中具有潜力。

文档提到了烷烃裂合的当前研究背景，旨在通过结构反应关系研究进一步开发烷烃裂合催化剂。它展示了使用特定金属（如钼）的单金属体系的双重性质，与Goldman-Brookhart系统依赖于两种催化剂混合相比，这是一个新的发展。此外，文档首次展示了辅助配体（在这种情况下为酰基配体）可以被利用，从而为烷烃裂合催化剂的发展开辟了新途径。
