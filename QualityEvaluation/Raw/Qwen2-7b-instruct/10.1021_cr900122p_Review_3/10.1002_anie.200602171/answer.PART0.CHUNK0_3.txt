Alkane Metathesis Catalyzed by a Well-Defined Silica-Supported Mo Imido Alkylidene Complex: [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] Graphical Abstract A two-functions-in-one catalyst precursor allows an olefin metathesis catalyst to be turned into an alkane metathesis catalyst. A silica-supported alkyl alkylidene molybdenum complex containing an ancillary imido ligand is a highly active olefin metathesis catalyst and also acts as a catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis. This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.
The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources.1,2 Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC).
Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1).
When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%).
Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2).
Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction).
Note that the alkane cross-metathesis products are obtained in a 3.4:1 ratio, which is very close to the ratio of olefin cross-metathesis products 3,3-dimethylbutene and (E)-4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene, obtained during the metathesis of propene on 1a (that is, 2.7:1), and this is consistent with the proposed elementary steps, and especially with olefin metathesis being the key carboncarbon bond-formation step.

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, both systems involve the utilization of metal hydrides supported on inorganic supports. In the case of silica-supported molybdenum complexes, a single metal (molybdenum) exhibits dual catalytic functions, both for olefin metathesis and alkane metathesis. Ancillary ligands, such as imido groups, enhance the compatibility of these catalysts with alkane metathesis reactions. The structure of these catalysts typically involves a metal complex covalently bound to the support material, with ancillary ligands providing additional functionality and selectivity. 

In terms of mechanisms, the conversion of alkanes involves π-bond metathesis, where olefin and carbene interact to cleave and reform carbon-carbon bonds. This process is facilitated by alkylidene hydrides acting as key intermediates. The turnover frequency (TON) indicates the efficiency of the catalyst, with a constant value for a period of time followed by a reproducible decrease in conversion. The selectivity in the formation of alkane products is influenced by the relative positions of substituents in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, minimizing steric hindrance.

In contrast, the alumina-supported thorium hydride catalysts may exhibit different reactivity patterns due to differences in metal reactivity, support effects, and possibly distinct mechanisms for H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. However, specific details regarding the preparation, structure, and detailed catalytic mechanisms of alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not provided in the excerpt. It is suggested that the study of structurereactivity relationships could further elucidate the differences in performance and selectivity between these two types of catalysts.

比较了二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。两者都利用金属氢化物在无机支持材料上的应用。在二氧化硅支持的钼复合物系统中，单一金属（钼）具有双重催化功能，既可用于烯烃环化，又可用于烷烃环化。辅助配体，如咪唑基团，增强了这些催化剂与烷烃环化的兼容性。这些催化剂的结构通常涉及金属复合物与支撑材料的共价结合，辅助配体提供了额外的功能性和选择性。

就机制而言，烷烃的转换涉及π-键环化，其中烯烃和卡宾相互作用以切断并重新形成碳-碳键。这一过程通过烷基二烯作为关键中间体得到促进。转数（TON）表示催化剂的效率，在一段时间内保持恒定，随后是可重复的转化率下降。烷基产物的选择性受在金属-环状化合物中间体中取代基相对位置的影响，以最小化立体障碍。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物催化剂可能显示出不同的反应模式，由于金属活性、支持效应的不同以及可能的H/D交换和烷烃环化机制不同。然而，关于这两种催化剂的具体制备、结构和详细催化机制的细节并未在摘录中提供。研究表明，通过研究结构-反应性关系，可以进一步阐明这两种催化剂性能和选择性的差异。
