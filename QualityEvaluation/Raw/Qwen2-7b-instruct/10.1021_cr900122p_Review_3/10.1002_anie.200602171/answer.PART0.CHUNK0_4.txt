Alkane Metathesis Catalyzed by a Well-Defined Silica-Supported Mo Imido Alkylidene Complex: [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]
A two-functions-in-one catalyst precursor allows an olefin metathesis catalyst to be turned into an alkane metathesis catalyst.
This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.
When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%).
These selectivities are constant over time (see the Supporting Information), and noteworthy the selectivity in methane, probably produced by hydrogenolysis,16 is low as already observed for other Group 6 supported systems.
Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Note that this well-defined catalyst precursor achieves about the same TON (55) in 120 h as the original tantalum hydride catalyst supported on silica (TON=60) despite the presence of ancillary ligands.
The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources.
Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1).
Alkane metathesis products, 2,2-dimethylpropane (tBuCH2H; 0.82 equiv), 2,2-dimethylbutane (tBuCH2Me; 0.34 equiv), and 2,2-dimethylpentane (tBuCH2Et; 0.10 equiv) are formed within 120 h.
The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation).
Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not.
Therefore, the propagation step is probably hindered by the olefin-metathesis step, which would require a disfavored [2+2] cycloaddition between a disubstituted carbene and a disubstituted olefin.
In conclusion, the well-defined Mo/imido surface complex 1a belongs to a new type of silica-supported catalyst precursor for the metathesis of linear alkanes at moderate temperatures (150C).

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions is beyond the scope of this literature. The document focuses on a specific Mo/imido alkylidene complex supported on silica that enables alkane metathesis catalysis. It discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of this complex, particularly in terms of its ability to convert alkanes into lower and higher homologues through olefin metathesis and hydrogenolysis mechanisms. However, the document does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or zirconium hydrides, nor does it compare their activities in C-H bond activation reactions.

The document mentions that the system involving the silica-supported Mo/imido complex demonstrates dual functionality, allowing it to act both as an olefin metathesis catalyst and a catalyst precursor for alkane metathesis. It also highlights the role of ancillary ligands in facilitating alkane metathesis reactions. The selectivities in the alkane metathesis products are influenced by steric interactions, as seen in the formation of different alkane isomers. The catalyst precursor achieves comparable turnover numbers to those of other supported metal hydride catalysts, despite incorporating ancillary ligands.

The catalyst precursor, [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], converts propane into ethane, butane, and smaller quantities of methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivities in methane production, attributed to hydrogenolysis, are low compared to other Group 6 supported systems. The turnover frequency is constant for a certain period before decreasing reproducibly. The catalyst precursor achieves a similar turnover number in 120 hours to that of a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis involves π-bond metathesis, which is the key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and forming step. Ancillary ligands, such as imido groups, are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions, as demonstrated by the catalyst precursor's activity. The selectivity of alkane metathesis products is influenced by steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The catalyst precursor facilitates the conversion of butane into lower and higher homologues, along with cross-metathesis products, whereas ethane conversion is not as efficient. The catalyst's performance is consistent with optimized oil resource utilization through more efficient chemical routes.

In summary, the document provides insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of a silica-supported Mo/imido alkylidene complex specifically for alkane metathesis catalysis. It does not cover the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides or zirconium hydrides, nor does it compare their activities in C-H bond activation reactions.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质超出了本文档的范围。本文档专注于一种特定的Mo/imido烷基二烯体复合物，它支持在二氧化硅上，能够进行烷基二烯体催化。它讨论了该复合物的制备、结构和催化性能，特别是它如何通过烯烃代谢和氢解离机制将烷基转化为较低和较高同系物。然而，本文档没有提供关于氧化铝支持的钍化氢或锆化氢的信息，也没有比较它们在C-H键活化反应中的活性。

文中提到，该系统包含的二氧化硅支持的Mo/imido复合物显示出双功能特性，允许其作为烯烃代谢催化剂，并且作为烷基代谢催化剂的前体。它强调了辅助配体在促进烷基代谢反应中的作用。烷基代谢产物的选择性受到立体相互作用的影响，例如不同烷基异构体的形成。

催化剂前体在120小时内达到与二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化剂相似的转化率（55），尽管包含辅助配体。文章指出，过去几年中，低温下烷基转换引起了人们的兴趣，因为这为优化石油资源提供了更高效的化学途径。

文档描述了用于催化烷基转换的催化剂前体[(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]，它将丙烷转化为主要的乙烷（56.1%）、丁烷（35.3%）和少量的甲烷（0.1%）、异丁烷（2.7%）和戊烷（5.9%）。这些选择性在时间上保持不变（参见补充信息），值得注意的是，甲烷的选择性，可能由氢解离产生，是低的，类似于其他第6组支持系统的观察结果。此外，转化频率在40小时内保持恒定（约为1 TONh1；TON=转化次数），然后有可重复的转化减少（表1和图1）。该催化剂前体在120小时内达到与二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化剂相似的转化率（55），尽管包含了辅助配体。

烷基转换的机制涉及π-键代谢，这是碳-碳键断裂和形成的关键步骤。辅助配体，如imido基团，与烷基代谢反应兼容，如催化剂前体的活性所证明的那样。烷基代谢产物的选择性受metalla-cyclobutane中间体形成的立体相互作用的影响。催化剂前体能够高效地将丁烷转化为更低和更高同系物及其交叉代谢产物，而乙烷的转化效率则不高。催化剂的性能与优化石油资源利用通过更高效的化学途径是一致的。

综上所述，本文档提供了二氧化硅支持的Mo/imido烷基二烯体复合物用于烷基代谢催化的准备、结构和催化性质的见解。它没有覆盖氧化铝支持的钍化氢或锆化氢的制备、结构或催化性质，也没有比较它们在C-H键活化反应中的活性。
