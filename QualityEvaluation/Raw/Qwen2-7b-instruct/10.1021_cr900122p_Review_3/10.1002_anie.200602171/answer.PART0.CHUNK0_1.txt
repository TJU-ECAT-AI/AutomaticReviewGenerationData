[1] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."
[2] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
[3] "Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2)."
[4] "Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction)."
[5] "This model is also consistent with the observed product selectivity and explains the greater selectivity of butane relative to that of pentane when starting from 1c (R=R=Et) and when the cross-metathesis of the resulting propagating alkylidene hydride intermediate 2b (X=H, R=Et) and propene is involved."
[6] "Therefore, the propagation step is probably hindered by the olefin-metathesis step, which would require a disfavored [2+2] cycloaddition between a disubstituted carbene and a disubstituted olefin."

Comparing the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, we find that both types of catalysts play crucial roles in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. However, the specific mechanisms and outcomes differ.

Silica-supported molybdenum complexes, such as [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], are highly active in olefin metathesis. These complexes act as catalyst precursors for alkane metathesis due to their dual functionality, allowing for the transformation of alkanes into lower and higher homologues. Ancillary ligands, like imido groups, can be used in these systems, demonstrating their versatility in catalysis. The turnover frequency is constant for 40 hours, indicating stable performance, but there is a reproducible decrease in conversion thereafter. The selectivity of the products suggests that π-bond metathesis is the key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and-forming step. Ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides might exhibit different catalytic properties and mechanisms. Their structures and preparation methods could lead to distinct reactivity patterns compared to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. The document does not provide detailed comparisons of these two catalysts in C-H bond activation reactions, focusing instead on the silica-supported molybdenum complex's capabilities in alkane metathesis. The document does not explicitly discuss the mechanisms, reaction rates, or selectivity of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in these processes.

Answering the second question requires additional information beyond the provided document, as it asks for a comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in terms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The document focuses on the silica-supported molybdenum complex's capabilities and does not provide sufficient details to compare it directly with alumina-supported thorium hydrides in the specified contexts. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between the two catalyst types in the requested chemical processes cannot be derived from the available information.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化性质，我们发现这两种催化剂在氢/氘交换和烷烃裂解中起着关键作用。然而，它们的具体机制和结果有所不同。

二氧化硅支持的钼复合物，如[(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]，在烯烃裂合中非常活跃。这些复合物作为烷烃裂解的催化剂前体，由于其双重功能，允许烷烃转化为更低和更高同系物。辅助配体，如脒基团，可以在这些系统中使用，展示了它们在催化方面的灵活性。转化频率在40小时内保持恒定，表明稳定的性能，但随后有可重复的转化率下降。产物的选择性表明π-键裂合是碳-碳键断裂和形成的步骤的关键。辅助配体与烷烃裂解反应兼容。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍化物可能在C-H键激活反应中表现出不同的催化性质。它们的结构和制备方法可能导致与二氧化硅支持的锆化物不同的反应活性模式。文档没有提供关于这两种催化剂的详细比较，而是集中在二氧化硅支持的钼复合物的烷烃裂解能力上。文档没有明确讨论在指定上下文中铝氧支持的钍化物的机制、反应速率或选择性。

回答第二个问题需要超出所提供的文档的信息，因为它要求比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在氢/氘交换和烷烃裂解中的催化性质。文档专注于二氧化硅支持的钼复合物的能力，并没有提供足够的信息直接将它们与氧化铝支持的钍化物进行此类比较。因此，从可用信息中无法得出这两种催化剂类型在请求的化学过程中的全面比较。
