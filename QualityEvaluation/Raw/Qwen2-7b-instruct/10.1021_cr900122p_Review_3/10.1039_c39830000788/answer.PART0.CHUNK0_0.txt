The literature focuses on the selective catalytic conversion of cycloalkanes into cycloalkenes using a soluble rhenium polyhydride system. The key steps involve the activation of the catalyst through thermal or photochemical means, leading to the formation of highly reactive intermediates capable of inserting into C-H bonds of the cycloalkanes. By using low concentrations of the reagents, the dehydrogenation process becomes catalytic, resulting in high yields of cycloalkenes. The study highlights the efficiency of the bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 as catalysts, particularly the (la) form, in converting cycloalkanes to cycloalkenes under mild conditions. The results demonstrate that this process is selective and non-radical, establishing the feasibility of using soluble transition-metal catalysts for the selective functionalization of unstrained hydrocarbons.

文献主要关注使用可溶性铼聚氢系统选择性催化环烷烃转化为环烯烃的过程。关键步骤涉及通过热或光化学激活催化剂，导致形成能够插入环烷烃中的C-H键的非常活泼中间体。通过使用较低浓度的试剂，脱氢过程成为催化性的，从而获得高产率的环烯烃。研究强调了bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides（Ar3P），ReH7作为催化剂的有效性，特别是la形式，在温和条件下将环烷烃转化为环烯烃。结果表明该过程具有选择性和非自由基性，证明了使用可溶性过渡金属催化剂对非受限碳氢化合物的选择性功能化的可行性。
