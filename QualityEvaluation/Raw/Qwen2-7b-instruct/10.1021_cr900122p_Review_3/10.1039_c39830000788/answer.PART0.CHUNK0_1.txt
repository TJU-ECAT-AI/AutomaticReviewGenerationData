[1] "Selective catalytic dehydrogenation (up to 9 turnovers) of cycloalkanes CnHZn (n = 6, 7, and 8) to the corresponding cycloalkenes is achieved, under mild conditions (30-80 °C), using dilute (ca. 3 mM) solutions of the bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 (Ar = p-F-C6H4, Ph, and p-Me-C6H,) in the cycloalkane, with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor."
[2] "The key step in the conversion of cycloalkanes C,H,,(n = 6, 7, and 8) into the corresponding cycloalkenes using the bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar,P),ReH, (la-c),in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbut-l-ene (2) as a hydrogen acceptor, is thought to involve the insertion of a 14e intermediate such as (Ar3P),ReH3 into a C-H bond of the cycloalkane."
[3] "We have recently re-examined these reactions and found that,in some cases, the yields of cycloalkenes are higher than those we reported previously [30--80% based on ( 1)12 especially in reactions involving the heptahydride (la), which now appears to be a more efficient reagent than both (lb) and (lc)."
[4] "Our best results have been obtained with the heptahydride (la) and cyclo-octane. This system is far more reactive than we previously suspected."
[5] "When a pale buff, deoxygenated, solution of (la) (3.3 mM) and the olefin (2) (50 mM) in cyclo-octane was made up at ca. 20 °C and then placed in a bath preheated to 30 °C, within 5 min the colour had changed to pale amber and cyclo-octene (0.7 mM, 0.2 turnover) had already been formed."
[6] "Under similar conditions (bath preheated to 80 °C),cyclohexane gave cyclohexene (3.2 turnovers) and cyclo-heptane gave cycloheptene (4 turnovers)."
[7] "The yields were determined by g.c."
[8] "These reactions were totally selective; no other dehydrogenation products (e.g., benzene from cyclohexane) could be detected."
[9] "The relatively large free energy of hydrogenation of the olefin (2) (21.9 kcal/mol) is not a determining factor in these reactions, since the dehydrogenation of cyclo-octane [using (la)] was still catalytic (5 turnovers instead of 9) with cyclohexene (free energy of hydrogenation 18.7 kcal/mol) as the hydrogen acceptor instead of (2)."
[10] "The results (Table I) are interesting for several reasons: (a) they show that the various olefins, once formed, are not all interconverted by these rhenium hydride systems, since 1-methylcyclohexene (the most stable of the four isomers) is present in no more than trace amounts; (b) they show that radical intermediates cannot be involved, since the major products (3- and 4-methylcyclohexene) cannot have arisen from the tertiary 1-methylcyclohexyl radical which would have been formed preferentially in a radical process; (c) they show that adventitious traces of a rhenium colloid cannot be responsible for these dehydrogenations, since a common intermediate such as this would have led to the formation of the same mixture of olefins from all three heptahydrides; and (d) they suggest that the intrinsic reactivity sequence is Me > CH2 > CH3 and that this is counteracted by a strong steric effect which directs the reagents, especially those containing bulky phosphines (Ar,P), away from the more hindered sites (i.e., Me, 2-CH2, and 6-CH2 in methylcyclohexane)."

Answer: The selective catalytic conversion of cycloalkanes into cycloalkenes is achieved using dilute solutions of bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 in cycloalkanes with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor. The key step involves the insertion of a 14e intermediate into a C-H bond of the cycloalkane. The yields of cycloalkenes are higher when using the heptahydride (la) compared to (lb) and (lc). The system functions catalytically even at 30°C, with the number of turnovers greater when the bath is preheated to 80°C. The reactions are totally selective, showing no other dehydrogenation products besides the desired cycloalkenes. The results suggest that the intrinsic reactivity sequence is Me > CH2 > CH3, which is counteracted by a strong steric effect directing the reagents away from the more hindered sites in methylcyclohexane.

Answer: The selective catalytic dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes into cycloalkenes occurs under mild conditions (30-80 °C) using dilute solutions of bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides in cycloalkanes with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor. The mechanism involves the insertion of a 14e intermediate into a C-H bond of the cycloalkane. The heptahydride (la) is found to be a more efficient reagent than (lb) and (lc) for these conversions. The reactions exhibit high selectivity, with no other dehydrogenation products detected besides the desired cycloalkenes. The intrinsic reactivity sequence suggests that methyl groups are more reactive than secondary and tertiary groups, which is attributed to a strong steric effect.

Answer: The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions are not described in this document. However, it does discuss the use of bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides for the selective dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes into cycloalkenes. The key step involves the insertion of a 14e intermediate into a C-H bond of the cycloalkane. The document provides details on the efficiency of different heptahydrides, reaction conditions, and selectivity of the reactions. It also discusses the intrinsic reactivity sequence and the role of steric effects in directing the reagents towards less hindered sites.

Answer: The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions are not covered in this document. The focus is on the use of bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides for selective dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes. The document highlights the mechanism involving C-H bond insertion, the efficiency of different heptahydrides, reaction conditions, selectivity, and the intrinsic reactivity sequence influenced by steric effects.

答案：使用稀释的bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides（Ar3P），ReH7在环烷烃中与烯烃作为氢接受体，可以实现环烷烃向环烯烃的选择性催化转化。关键步骤涉及将一个14e中间体插入环烷烃的C-H键中。当使用heptahydride（la）时，发现其比（lb）和（lc）更有效。系统在30°C甚至在80°C预热的浴中都能催化反应，且在较高温度下，每摩尔heptahydride可获得更多的环烯烃分子。反应具有高度的选择性，未检测到除目标环烯烃外的其他脱氢产物。结果表明，甲基团的反应活性高于次级和三级组，这归因于强烈的立体位阻效应，导致试剂倾向于避开更受阻的位点（即甲基、2-CH2和6-CH2在甲基环烷烃中）。
