[1] "Selectively catalytic dehydrogenation (up to 9 turnovers) of cycloalkanes CnHZn (n = 6, 7, and 8) to the corresponding cycloalkenes is achieved, under mild conditions (30-80 °C), using dilute (ca. 3 mM) solutions of the bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 (Ar = p-F-C6H4, Ph, and p-Me-C,H,) in the cycloalkane, with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor."
[2] "Under similar conditions (bath preheated to 80 °C), cyclohexane gave cyclohexene (3.2 turnovers) and cycloheptane gave cycloheptene (4 turnovers)."
[3] "Our best results have been obtained with the heptahydride (la) and cyclo-octane. This system is far more reactive than we previously suspected."
[4] "The yields of cycloalkenes are higher than those we reported previously [30--80% based on (1)], especially in reactions involving the heptahydride (la), which now appears to be a more efficient reagent than both (lb) and (lc)."
[5] "These reactions were totally selective; no other dehydrogenation products (e.g., benzene from cyclohexane) could be detected."

The literature discusses the selective catalytic conversion of cycloalkanes into cycloalkenes using soluble rhenium polyhydrides. The key step involves the insertion of a 14e intermediate into a C-H bond of the cycloalkane. The conversion is achieved under mild conditions (30-80 °C) using dilute solutions of the bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides in the presence of an olefin as a hydrogen acceptor. The best results were observed with the heptahydride (la) and cyclo-octane, indicating a highly reactive system. The yields of cycloalkenes were found to be higher than previously reported, especially with the heptahydride (la), which was identified as a more efficient reagent than (lb) and (lc). The reactions were totally selective, with no other dehydrogenation products detectable, such as benzene from cyclohexane.

文献讨论了使用可溶性铼聚氢化合物催化转化环烷烃为环烯烃。关键步骤涉及14e中间体插入环烷烃的C-H键。在30-80°C的温和条件下，通过将二磷化物铼七氢化合物的稀溶液与环烷烃和作为氢接受剂的烯烃共存实现转化。最佳结果是在七氢化合物（la）和环辛烷的存在下获得的，表明系统具有高度反应性。发现环烯烃的产率高于之前报道的，特别是当使用七氢化合物（la）时，它被识别为比（lb）和（lc）更有效的试剂。反应完全选择性，未检测到其他脱氢产物，如环己烷转化为苯。
