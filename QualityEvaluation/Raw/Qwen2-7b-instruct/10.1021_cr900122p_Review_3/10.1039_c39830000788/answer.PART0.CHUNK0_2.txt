[1] "Selectively catalytic dehydrogenation (up to 9 turnovers) of cycloalkanes CnHZn (n = 6, 7, and 8) to the corresponding cycloalkenes is achieved, under mild conditions (30-80 °C), using dilute (ca. 3 mM) solutions of the bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 (Ar = p-F-C6H4, Ph, and p-Me-C6H4) in the cycloalkane, with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor."
[2] "This system therefore functions catalytically even at 30 °C. The number of turnovers was greater [9 mol of cyclo-octenez per mol of (la) after 10 min] when the bath was preheated to 80 °C."
[3] "Under similar conditions (bath preheated to 80 °C), cyclohexane gave cyclohexene (3.2 turnovers) and cyclo-heptane gave cycloheptene (4 turnovers)."
[4] "These reactions were totally selective; no other dehydrogenation products (e.g., benzene from cyclohexane) could be detected."

The document describes the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes using a soluble rhenium polyhydride system. This process converts cycloalkanes CnHZn (n = 6, 7, and 8) into their corresponding cycloalkenes under mild conditions (30-80 °C) using dilute solutions of bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 (where Ar includes p-F-C6H4, Ph, and p-Me-C6H4) in the cycloalkane, with an olefin serving as the hydrogen acceptor. The reactions occur catalytically, even at lower temperatures (30 °C), with the number of turnovers increasing to 9 when the temperature is raised to 80 °C. The system is highly selective, producing only the desired cycloalkenes without forming other dehydrogenation products such as benzene from cyclohexane.

文档描述了使用可溶性铼聚氢系统进行环烷烃的选择性催化脱氢。该过程在温和条件下（30-80 °C）将环烷烃CnHZn（n = 6、7和8）转化为其对应的环烯烃，使用稀释的bis(phosphine)铼七氢化物（Ar3P），ReH7（其中Ar包括p-F-C6H4、Ph和p-Me-C6H4）在环烷烃中，以及一个烯烃作为氢接受体。这些反应在催化剂作用下发生，即使在较低温度（30 °C）下也能进行，当温度升高至80 °C时，每摩尔（la）的周转次数增加到9次。该系统具有高度选择性，仅生成所需的环烯烃，而不会形成其他脱氢产物，如从环己烷生成苯。
