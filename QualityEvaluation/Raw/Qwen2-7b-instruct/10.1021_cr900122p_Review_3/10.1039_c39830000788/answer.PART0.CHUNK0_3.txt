[1] "Selective catalytic dehydrogenation (up to 9 turnovers) of cycloalkanes CnHZn (n = 6, 7, and 8) to the corresponding cycloalkenes is achieved, under mild conditions (30-80 °C), using dilute (ca. 3 mM) solutions of the bis(phosphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 (Ar = p-F-C6H4, Ph, and p-Me-C,H,) in the cycloalkane, with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor."
[2] "We now report that this is indeed the case."
[3] "Our best results have been obtained with the heptahydride (la) and cyclo-octane. This system is far more reactive than we previously suspected."
[4] "When a pale buff, deoxygenated, solution of (la) (3.3 mM) and the olefin (2) (50 mM) in cyclo-octane was made up at ca. 20 °C and then placed in a bath preheated to 30 °C, within 5 min the colour had changed to pale amber and cyclo-octene (0.7 mM, 0.2 turnover) had already been formed."
[5] "Under similar conditions (bath preheated to 80 °C),cyclohexane gave cyclohexene (3.2 turnovers) and cyclo-heptane gave cycloheptene (4 turnovers)."
[6] "The yields were determined by g.c."
[7] "These reactions were totally selective; no other dehydrogenation products (e.g., benzene from cyclohexane) could be detected."
[8] "The relatively large free energy of hydrogenation of the olefin (2) (21.9 kcal/mol) is not a determining factor in these reactions, since the dehydrogenation of cyclo-octane [using (la)] was still catalytic (5 turnovers instead of 9) with cyclohexene (free energy of hydrogenation 18.7 kcal/mol) as the hydrogen acceptor instead of (2)."
[9] "The results (Table I) are interesting for several reasons:"
[10] "(a) they show that the various olefins, once formed, are not all interconverted by these rhenium hydride systems, since 1-methylcyclohexene (the most stable of the four isomers) is present in no more than trace amounts."
[11] "(b) they show that radical intermediates cannot be involved, since the major products (3- and 4-methylcyclohexene) cannot have arisen from the tertiary 1-methylcyclohexyl radical which would have been formed preferentially in a radical process."
[12] "(c) they show that adventitious traces of a rhenium colloid cannot be responsible for these dehydrogenations, since a common intermediate such as this would have led to the formation of the same mixture of olefins from all three heptahydrides."
[13] "(d) they suggest that the intrinsic reactivity sequence is Me > CH, > CH, and that this is counteracted by a strong steric effect which directs the reagents, especially those containing bulky phosphines (Ar,P), away from the more hindered sites (i.e., Me, 2-CH,, and 6-CH2 in methylcyclohexane)."

The literature focuses on the selective catalytic conversion of cycloalkanes into cycloalkenes using soluble rhenium polyhydride systems. The key steps involve the insertion of a 14-electron intermediate into a C-H bond of the cycloalkane. The system functions catalytically even at 30 °C, achieving up to 9 turnovers of cycloalkanes to cycloalkenes under mild conditions. The yield of cycloalkenes increases significantly with lower concentrations of the reagents. The results are highly selective, with no other dehydrogenation products detected. The free energy of hydrogenation of the olefin does not affect the reaction rate. The intrinsic reactivity sequence suggests that the more substituted alkyl groups react faster than less substituted ones, which is counteracted by a strong steric effect.

文献主要关注使用可溶性铑聚氢系统对环烷烃进行选择性催化转化为环烯烃。关键步骤包括将一个14电子中间体插入环烷烃的C-H键中。该系统在30°C下就能发挥催化作用，实现环烷烃到环烯烃的转化，最高可达9次转化。通过降低反应物浓度，环烯烃的产率显著提高。结果高度选择性，未检测到其他脱氢产物。氢化烯烃的自由能不会影响反应速率。内在反应活性序列表明，取代基更多的烷基团比较少取代的烷基团反应更快，这被强烈的立体位阻效应所抵消。
