Silica-supported catalyst 1 demonstrates advantages over its molecular equivalent 1m in terms of stability and turnover frequency. This is due to the effect of site isolation on surfaces. The molecular complexes 1m and 1n, prepared through substitution of the silica surface's siloxy group with a molecular monosiloxy equivalent, show similar electronic properties to 1 and 1m in olefin metathesis reactions. Catalyst 1 exhibits significantly higher turnover frequency (TOF) when reacting with propene, achieving 1.0 mol(molMo)1s1 compared to 0.25 mol(molRe)1s1 for [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]. The quasi-inactivity of molecular complex 2 underscores the activating role of the siloxyl group in enhancing catalytic activity.

1. 硅基支持催化剂1在稳定性及周转频率方面优于其分子等效物1m。这是由于表面隔离效应的作用。通过将硅表面的硅氧烷基团替换为分子单硅氧烷基团制备得到的分子复合物1m和1n，在烯烃裂解反应中显示出与1和1m相似的电子性质。催化剂1在与丙烯反应时展现出显著更高的周转频率（TOF），达到1.0 mol(molMo)1s1，相比之下[(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]的TOF为0.25 mol(molRe)1s1。分子复合物2的几乎无活性凸显了硅氧烷基团在增强催化活性方面的激活作用。
