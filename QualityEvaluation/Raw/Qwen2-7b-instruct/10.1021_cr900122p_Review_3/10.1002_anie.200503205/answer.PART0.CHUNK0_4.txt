[1] "Despite similar initial turnover frequencies, the silica-supported catalyst 1 is more stable than 1m and allows it to achieve higher turnovers, thus showing the advantage of site isolation on surfaces."
[2] "When immersed in a solution of 2 in pentane, a SiO2-(700) disk immediately turned yellow. After 2 h, the disk was washed three times with pentane, dried under vacuum for 1 h at 25C, and analyzed by IR spectroscopy."
[3] "The 1H magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectrum of 1 (Figure 1a) displays distinct signals at δ=11.7 (CHtBu, 1H), 6.8 (CH, 3H), 3.5 (CHMe2, 2H), and 0.9 ppm (CH3, 30H)."
[4] "The corresponding molecular complexes 1m and 1n, with a molecular monosiloxy equivalent, were prepared by using (RO)3SiOH in place of a siloxy group of the silica surface (Scheme 1)."
[5] "When 1 is contacted with 1350 equivalents of propene at 25C (batch reactor), equilibrium is reached within 20 min (around 30% conversion, E/Z-butene ratio=2.6) with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.0 mol(molMo)1s1, which is four times faster than with [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] (TOF=0.25 mol(molRe)1s1)."

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported catalyst 1, a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst for olefin metathesis, was synthesized by reacting 2 with SiO2-(700) at 25°C. This process led to the formation of distinct signals in the 1H magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectrum of 1. In contrast, the alumina-supported thorium hydrides were not discussed in this context. The silica-supported catalyst demonstrated higher stability and achieved higher turnovers compared to the molecular equivalent 1m, indicating the benefit of active-site isolation on surfaces. The catalyst reached equilibrium within 20 minutes upon contacting with propene, achieving a turnover frequency four times faster than a comparable molecular complex. However, the specific mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, as well as the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes, were not elaborated upon in the provided literature.

在C-H键激活反应中，二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在制备、结构和催化性能方面存在差异。在二氧化硅支持的催化剂1中，通过将2与700°C下部分脱水的二氧化硅接触，在25°C下合成了一个用于烯烃裂解的有序异质催化剂。这一过程导致1的1H魔法角旋转（MAS）固体状态核磁共振谱显示出独特的信号。相反，没有讨论氧化铝支持的钍化物。二氧化硅支持的催化剂显示了比分子等效物1m更高的稳定性和更高的周转次数，这表明表面活性位点隔离的优势。催化剂在与丙烯接触后20分钟内达到平衡，其周转频率是与之相当的分子复合物的四倍。然而，H/D交换和烷烃裂解的具体机制，以及σ键裂解、氢解和链行走在这些过程中所起的作用，并未在这篇文献中详细阐述。
