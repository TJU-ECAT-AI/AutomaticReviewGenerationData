Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both catalysts used in C-H bond activation reactions, specifically in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. These catalysts differ significantly in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties.

In terms of preparation, the silica-supported zirconium hydride (referred to as catalyst 1 in the document) is synthesized through the reaction of a zirconium alkylidene complex with a dehydrated silica surface. This process leads to the formation of a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydride preparation details are not provided in the document.

Structurally, the silica-supported catalyst (catalyst 1) consists of a zirconium alkylidene complex covalently bonded to the surface of the silica support. The molecular structure of the catalyst is elucidated through solid-state NMR spectroscopy, revealing distinct signals for various functional groups within the catalyst.

Regarding catalytic properties, the silica-supported catalyst exhibits faster turnover frequencies in olefin metathesis reactions compared to a molecular thorium hydride catalyst. For instance, catalyst 1 achieves a turnover frequency of 1.0 mol(molMo)1s1, whereas a thorium hydride catalyst has a turnover frequency of 0.25 mol(molRe)1s1 under the same conditions. Additionally, the silica-supported catalyst facilitates the formation of about 0.7 equivalents of cross-metathesis products, indicating a well-defined system that generates active species efficiently.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in preparation methods, structural composition, and catalytic efficiency in C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported catalyst demonstrates superior performance in terms of turnover frequency and the generation of active species, highlighting the advantages of site isolation on surfaces for enhanced catalytic activity.

硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都是用于C-H键激活反应的催化剂，特别是用于H/D交换和烷烃裂合。这些催化剂在制备、结构和催化性质方面存在显著差异。

在制备方面，硅支持的锆化氢（文档中称为催化剂1）通过锆化烯基复合物与脱水硅表面的反应合成。这一过程导致形成一个定义明确的异质催化剂。另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍化氢的制备细节未在文档中提供。

从结构上看，硅支持的催化剂由一个锆化烯基复合物与硅支持表面共价键合组成。通过固体状态核磁共振光谱对催化剂进行了结构解析，揭示了催化剂内各种功能团的特定信号。

关于催化性能，硅支持的催化剂在烯烃裂合反应中的周转频率比分子型钍化氢催化剂更快。例如，催化剂1的周转频率为1.0 mol(molMo)1s1，而分子型钍化氢催化剂在相同条件下为0.25 mol(molRe)1s1。此外，硅支持的催化剂还促进了约0.7等价的交叉裂合产物的形成，表明该系统有效地生成活性物种。

总之，硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在制备方法、结构组成和C-H键激活反应的催化性质方面存在差异。硅支持的催化剂在周转频率和活性物种生成方面表现出优越性能，突出了表面隔离位点增强催化活性的优点。
