[1] "We report herein the synthesis and characterization of [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] (1), a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst for olefin metathesis, and its molecular equivalents 1m and 1n."
[2] "The 13C cross-polarization (CP) MAS spectrum contains 11 resolved peaks, which can be tentatively assigned as follows: δ=22 (CH(CH3)2), 29 (CHC(CH3)3), 31 (CH2C(CH3)3), 36 (CH2CMe3), 46 (CHCMe3), 56 (CH2tBu), 122 (Cpara), 126 (Cmeta), 145 (Cortho), 153 (Cipso), and 279 ppm (CHtBu)."
[3] "When immersed in a solution of 2 in pentane, a SiO2-(700) disk immediately turned yellow. After 2 h, the disk was washed three times with pentane, dried under vacuum for 1 h at 25C, and analyzed by IR spectroscopy."
[4] "Moreover, the self-metathesis of 0.5M solutions of 1-octene and ethyl oleate in toluene in the presence of 1% of 1 gives the equilibrated mixture in 10 and 60 min, respectively (Table 1)."
[5] "In conclusion, we have shown that the molecular and surface complexes 1 and 1m are electronically very similar in terms of both their comparable NMR data and initial TOFs in olefin metathesis."

Silica-supported catalyst [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] (1) and its molecular equivalents 1m and 1n were synthesized and characterized for olefin metathesis. The 13C cross-polarization (CP) MAS spectrum contained 11 resolved peaks, which were tentatively assigned. The silica-supported catalyst was prepared by immersing a SiO2-(700) disk in a solution of 2 in pentane. The self-metathesis of 1-octene and ethyl oleate in the presence of 1% of 1 gave the equilibrated mixture in 10 and 60 min, respectively. The silica-supported catalyst and its molecular equivalents were found to be electronically similar in terms of their NMR data and initial turnover frequencies in olefin metathesis.

我们报道了合成并表征了[(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]（1）及其分子等效物1m和1n作为共轭二烯加成的异构体催化剂，并进行了表征。13C交叉极化（CP）MAS谱包含11个可分辨的峰，可以初步分配。通过将含有2的五烷溶液浸入SiO2-(700)盘中制备了支持硅的催化剂。在1%的1存在下，辛-1-烯和乙基油酸的自我加成分别在10和60分钟内得到了平衡混合物。硅支持的催化剂及其分子等效物在共轭二烯加成反应中的NMR数据和初始转数频率上表现出电子上的相似性。
