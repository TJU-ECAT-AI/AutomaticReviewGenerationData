1. The literature does not compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. It focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst for olefin metathesis, specifically a siloxy ligand-modified molybdenum complex supported on silica.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are both catalysts used in C-H bond activation reactions, specifically in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. These catalysts differ significantly in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties.

In terms of preparation, the silica-supported zirconium hydride (referred to as catalyst 1 in the document) is synthesized through the reaction of a zirconium alkylidene complex with a dehydrated silica surface. This process leads to the formation of a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst. On the other hand, alumina-supported thorium hydride preparation details are not provided in the document.

Structurally, the silica-supported catalyst (catalyst 1) consists of a zirconium alkylidene complex covalently bonded to the surface of the silica support. The molecular structure of the catalyst is elucidated through solid-state NMR spectroscopy, revealing distinct signals for various functional groups within the catalyst.

Regarding catalytic properties, the silica-supported catalyst exhibits faster turnover frequencies in olefin metathesis reactions compared to a molecular thorium hydride catalyst. For instance, catalyst 1 achieves a turnover frequency of 1.0 mol(molMo)1s1, whereas a thorium hydride catalyst has a turnover frequency of 0.25 mol(molRe)1s1 under the same conditions. Additionally, the silica-supported catalyst facilitates the formation of about 0.7 equivalents of cross-metathesis products, indicating a well-defined system that generates active species efficiently.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in preparation methods, structural composition, and catalytic efficiency in C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported catalyst demonstrates superior performance in terms of turnover frequency and the generation of active species, highlighting the advantages of site isolation on surfaces for enhanced catalytic activity.

硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢都是用于C-H键激活反应的催化剂，特别是用于H/D交换和烷烃裂合。这些催化剂在制备、结构和催化性质方面存在显著差异。

在制备方面，硅支持的锆化氢（文档中称为催化剂1）通过锆化烯基复合物与脱水硅表面的反应合成。这一过程导致形成一个定义明确的异质催化剂。另一方面，氧化铝支持的钍化氢的制备细节未在文档中提供。

从结构上看，硅支持的催化剂由一个锆化烯基复合物与硅支持表面共价键合组成。通过固体状态核磁共振光谱对催化剂进行了结构解析，揭示了催化剂内各种功能团的特定信号。

关于催化性能，硅支持的催化剂在烯烃裂合反应中的周转频率比分子型钍化氢催化剂更快。例如，催化剂1的周转频率为1.0 mol(molMo)1s1，而分子型钍化氢催化剂在相同条件下为0.25 mol(molRe)1s1。此外，硅支持的催化剂还促进了约0.7等价的交叉裂合产物的形成，表明该系统有效地生成活性物种。

总之，硅支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在制备方法、结构组成和C-H键激活反应的催化性质方面存在差异。硅支持的催化剂在周转频率和活性物种生成方面表现出优越性能，突出了表面隔离位点增强催化活性的优点。

Silica-supported catalyst 1 demonstrates advantages over its molecular equivalent 1m in terms of stability and turnover frequency. This is due to the effect of site isolation on surfaces. The molecular complexes 1m and 1n, prepared through substitution of the silica surface's siloxy group with a molecular monosiloxy equivalent, show similar electronic properties to 1 and 1m in olefin metathesis reactions. Catalyst 1 exhibits significantly higher turnover frequency (TOF) when reacting with propene, achieving 1.0 mol(molMo)1s1 compared to 0.25 mol(molRe)1s1 for [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]. The quasi-inactivity of molecular complex 2 underscores the activating role of the siloxyl group in enhancing catalytic activity.

1. 硅基支持催化剂1在稳定性及周转频率方面优于其分子等效物1m。这是由于表面隔离效应的作用。通过将硅表面的硅氧烷基团替换为分子单硅氧烷基团制备得到的分子复合物1m和1n，在烯烃裂解反应中显示出与1和1m相似的电子性质。催化剂1在与丙烯反应时展现出显著更高的周转频率（TOF），达到1.0 mol(molMo)1s1，相比之下[(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]的TOF为0.25 mol(molRe)1s1。分子复合物2的几乎无活性凸显了硅氧烷基团在增强催化活性方面的激活作用。

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The silica-supported catalyst 1, a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst for olefin metathesis, was synthesized by reacting 2 with SiO2-(700) at 25°C. This process led to the formation of distinct signals in the 1H magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectrum of 1. In contrast, the alumina-supported thorium hydrides were not discussed in this context. The silica-supported catalyst demonstrated higher stability and achieved higher turnovers compared to the molecular equivalent 1m, indicating the benefit of active-site isolation on surfaces. The catalyst reached equilibrium within 20 minutes upon contacting with propene, achieving a turnover frequency four times faster than a comparable molecular complex. However, the specific mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, as well as the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes, were not elaborated upon in the provided literature.

在C-H键激活反应中，二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物在制备、结构和催化性能方面存在差异。在二氧化硅支持的催化剂1中，通过将2与700°C下部分脱水的二氧化硅接触，在25°C下合成了一个用于烯烃裂解的有序异质催化剂。这一过程导致1的1H魔法角旋转（MAS）固体状态核磁共振谱显示出独特的信号。相反，没有讨论氧化铝支持的钍化物。二氧化硅支持的催化剂显示了比分子等效物1m更高的稳定性和更高的周转次数，这表明表面活性位点隔离的优势。催化剂在与丙烯接触后20分钟内达到平衡，其周转频率是与之相当的分子复合物的四倍。然而，H/D交换和烷烃裂解的具体机制，以及σ键裂解、氢解和链行走在这些过程中所起的作用，并未在这篇文献中详细阐述。
