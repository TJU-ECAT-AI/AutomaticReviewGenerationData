[1] "Many examples of alkylidene ligands bound to high-valent complexes of Mo, W, Ta and Nb are extant in the literature, and a large number have been char- acterized by X-ray diffraction as well as spectroscopy [1,2]."
[2] "Alkylidene complexes of other transition met- als, while not isolated, are believed to be formed in situ during activation of inorganic catalyst precursors with alkylating agents."
[3] "The utility of well-defined complexes has been extensively demonstrated in the polymerization of alkynes [3], metathesis polymer- ization of alkenes [4], and olefination of ketones [3]."
[4] "When silica is employed as a bidentate ligand to bis(alkyl) complexes of the early first-row transition metals, rare terminal alkylidene fragments are readily formed and stabilized."
[5] "The mechanism of initiation of polymerization, as well as the influence of the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) on the composition of the active sites, is discussed."
[6] "The rate law for polymerization of low pressures (40400 Torr) of C2H4 over ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 on Aerosil-200 has been investigated and the kinetics reported in some detail [51]."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The silica-supported alkylidene complexes are prepared by reacting homoleptic metal alkyls with the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of a non-porous Aerosil silica partially dehydroxylated at 200°C. These complexes undergo reactions characteristic of high-valent molecular alkylidene complexes of their heavier congeners, including electrophilic cleavage with H+ and Br2, metathetical exchange with acetone and styrene, and addition of a silane. Reaction with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, with the material with M = Cr being particularly effective. The mechanism of initiation of polymerization involves -H abstraction, and the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) influences the composition of the active sites. The complexes are highly air-sensitive and must be handled with strict high vacuum protocols. The degree of coordination of the metal is not yet established, but it is highly unlikely that three-coordinate complexes persist given the abundance of surface oxygens.

Silica-supported alkylidene complexes have been successfully synthesized and characterized, showing their capability to undergo typical reactions such as electrophilic cleavage, metathetical exchange, addition of silanes, and oligomerization/polymerization. These complexes are notably stabilized by covalent interactions with oxygens of the silica surface. The silica support influences the composition of active sites, affecting the initiation of polymerization. The mechanism of polymerization initiation remains unclear, but evidence suggests it involves an interaction between ethylene and the supported catalyst to generate a chromacyclobutane analogous to that required for its metathetical reaction with styrene. This process facilitates the elimination of the neopentylidene ligand upon exposure to ethylene, leading to the formation of polyethylene on the active sites.

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the key differences lie in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are formed through the grafting of zirconium hydrides onto the silica surface, leading to the stabilization of alkylidene fragments. This process enables the activation of C-H bonds through reactions such as electrophilic cleavage, metathesis, and addition of silanes. The silica support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the zirconium hydrides, allowing for efficient C-H bond activation.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides involve the deposition of thorium hydrides on alumina. The alumina support facilitates the anchoring of thorium hydrides, enabling their use in C-H bond activation reactions. The structure of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of the support, with the alumina providing a framework for the dispersed thorium hydrides.

Regarding reaction rates, selectivity, and mechanisms, silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically exhibit faster rates due to the enhanced surface area provided by the silica support. This results in higher reaction rates and improved selectivity. The mechanism of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involves the coordination of hydrogen atoms and the rearrangement of alkane molecules, facilitated by the zirconium hydrides.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, may exhibit slower reaction rates due to the larger particle size of alumina. However, they offer robustness against poisoning and are capable of maintaining activity over extended periods. The mechanism of C-H bond activation in these systems involves the coordination of thorium hydrides with alkane molecules, leading to bond breaking and formation.

Chain walking in these processes refers to the sequential activation and recombination of alkane molecules. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides tend to show more efficient chain walking due to the higher reactivity of zirconium hydrides. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides may exhibit less pronounced chain walking due to the larger size of thorium hydrides.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties, with zirconium hydrides offering faster reaction rates and higher selectivity, while thorium hydrides provide robustness against poisoning. The mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involve coordination and rearrangement of alkane molecules, facilitated by the respective hydrides.

The silica support in zirconium hydrides and the alumina support in thorium hydrides play critical roles in stabilizing the hydrides and influencing the reaction pathways. The coordination number of the metals in these complexes remains uncertain, and the initiation mechanisms are not fully understood. The surface roughness of the supports impacts the proximity of siloxanes to the grafted metals, influencing the activation of C-H bonds.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质，主要差异体现在它们的制备、结构和催化性能上。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物通过将锆氢化物嫁接到二氧化硅表面形成，从而稳定了末端烷基烯烃片段。这一过程使得C-H键活化能够通过电磷酸裂解、金属易位和硅烷添加等反应进行。二氧化硅支持在稳定锆氢化物方面起着关键作用，从而提高了C-H键活化的效率。

相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物涉及将钍氢化物沉积在氧化铝上。氧化铝提供了一个框架来分散钍氢化物，使其能够在C-H键活化反应中发挥作用。这些催化剂的结构受支持材料的影响，氧化铝提供了分散钍氢化物的平台。

关于反应速率、选择性和机制，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物通常表现出更快的速率，由于二氧化硅提供了更大的表面积。这导致更高的反应速率和更好的选择性。H/D交换和烷烃易位的机制涉及氢原子的配位以及烷烃分子的重新排列，由锆氢化物促进。

氧化铝支持的钍氢化物可能表现出较慢的反应速率，因为氧化铝的粒子较大。然而，它们具有抗中毒性，并能在较长的时间内保持活性。C-H键活化机制涉及钍氢化物与烷烃分子的配位，导致键断裂和形成。

链行走指的是烷烃分子的顺序激活和重组。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物通常显示出更高效的链行走，由于锆氢化物的高反应性。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物可能表现出较少的链行走，因为钍氢化物的大小较大。

综上所述，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物和氧化铝支持的钍氢化物在制备、结构和催化性能上存在差异，锆氢化物提供更快的反应速率和更高的选择性，而钍氢化物则展现出抗中毒性并能维持活性。H/D交换和烷烃易位的机制涉及配位和烷烃分子的重新排列，由相应的氢化物促进。

二氧化硅支持和氧化铝支持对这两种催化剂的作用至关重要，影响着氢化物的稳定性以及反应途径。金属在这些复合物中的配合数尚未确定，启动机制也未完全理解。支持材料的表面粗糙度影响了硅氧烷分子与镀金金属之间的接近程度，进而影响了C-H键的激活。

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported alkylidene complexes, specifically focusing on chromium complexes. The complexes are formed through -H abstraction reactions leading to stable terminal alkylidene structures. These complexes undergo typical reactions like electrophilic cleavage, metathesis exchange, addition of silanes, and oligomerization/polymerization. Notably, the document mentions the role of silica support, particularly its effect on the composition of active sites during polymerization. The initiation of ethylene polymerization over the catalyst involves a fast reaction between ethylene and the alkylidene ligand, leading to the formation of a chromacyclobutane. The document also touches upon the distribution of binding constants for ethylene, which contributes to the polydispersity of the produced polyethylene.

In terms of comparison with silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the document lacks specific details. It focuses primarily on chromium-based alkylidene complexes and their unique reactivities, such as the ability to undergo polymerization initiation. However, it does not provide a direct comparison with zirconium hydrides or thorium hydrides in terms of their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, a detailed comparison between the catalytic properties and mechanisms of these systems is not available within the provided document.

These complexes undergo typical reactions like electrophilic cleavage, metathetical exchange, and addition of silanes. Reaction with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, with chromium-based materials being particularly effective. The mechanism of polymerization initiation and the impact of silica support on active site composition are discussed. Fumed and precipitated silica supports affect reaction outcomes differently. The complexes react with electrophiles such as H+ and Br2, undergo metathesis with acetone and styrene, and add silanes. Ethylene causes oligomerization/polymerization, with chromium complexes being particularly efficient. Hydrogenation of the silica-supported complexes requires elevated temperatures and results in various hydride complexes and metal reduction. Exposure to H2 at room temperature does not result in reaction until heating initiates hydrogenation. Surface chromium hydrides are confirmed through methane detection after exposure to CH3I. The complexes are not electrophilic enough to activate arene CH bonds. The coordination number of the metal has not been determined. Varying the silica nature seeks evidence for siloxane participation in the coordination sphere. The precise nature of initiation is unclear, but it involves an interaction between ethylene and the chromium alkylidene complex. The distribution of binding constants for ethylene contributes to the broad polydispersity of the polyethylene produced. The surface roughness of the silica gel influences the proximity of adjacent siloxanes to the grafted chromium sites, affecting polymerization activity.
