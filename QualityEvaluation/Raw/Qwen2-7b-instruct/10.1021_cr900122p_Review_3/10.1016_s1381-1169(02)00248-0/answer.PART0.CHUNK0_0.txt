The silica-supported alkylidene complexes are prepared by reacting homoleptic metal alkyls with the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of a non-porous Aerosil silica partially dehydroxylated at 200°C. These complexes undergo reactions characteristic of high-valent molecular alkylidene complexes of their heavier congeners, including electrophilic cleavage with H+ and Br2, metathetical exchange with acetone and styrene, and addition of a silane. Reaction with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, with the material with M = Cr being particularly effective. The mechanism of initiation of polymerization involves -H abstraction, and the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) influences the composition of the active sites. The complexes are highly air-sensitive and must be handled with strict high vacuum protocols. The degree of coordination of the metal is not yet established, but it is highly unlikely that three-coordinate complexes persist given the abundance of surface oxygens.

在200°C部分脱羟基的非多孔Aerosil硅胶表面的羟基上反应同核金属烷基化合物，可以制备出以早第一行过渡金属为主的硅支持的烷基烯基复合物。这些复合物能够形成和稳定末端烷基烯基碎片，并表现出与更重的同系物类似的反应特性，如通过H+和Br2的亲电裂解、与乙酮和苯乙烯的麦氏交换以及与硅烷的加成。与乙炔反应会导致多聚化/聚合，其中Cr金属特别有效。聚合的启动机制涉及-H的抽象，而硅胶支持（气溶胶型或沉淀型）对活性位点的组成有影响。这些复合物非常容易受空气的影响，必须遵循严格的高真空处理流程。金属的配位数尚未确定，但考虑到表面氧原子的丰富度，高度不可能存在三配位复合物的存在。
