[1] "The demonstration of the alkylidene ligand as an active site for olefin activation has led to wide acceptance of the Chauvin mechanism for olefin metathesis."
[2] "The mechanism of initiation of polymerization, as well as the influence of the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) on the composition of the active sites, is discussed."
[3] "The precise nature of the initiation is still unclear."
[4] "Both find precedent in experimental studies of tantala-cyclobutane decomposition in the presence of olefins."

Silica-supported alkylidene complexes have been successfully synthesized and characterized, showing their capability to undergo typical reactions such as electrophilic cleavage, metathetical exchange, addition of silanes, and oligomerization/polymerization. These complexes are notably stabilized by covalent interactions with oxygens of the silica surface. The silica support influences the composition of active sites, affecting the initiation of polymerization. The mechanism of polymerization initiation remains unclear, but evidence suggests it involves an interaction between ethylene and the supported catalyst to generate a chromacyclobutane analogous to that required for its metathetical reaction with styrene. This process facilitates the elimination of the neopentylidene ligand upon exposure to ethylene, leading to the formation of polyethylene on the active sites.

硅支持的烷基二烯化合物已经成功合成并表征，显示出能够进行典型反应，如亲电裂解、互换反应、硅烷添加和寡聚/聚合。这些化合物通过与硅表面氧原子之间的共价相互作用得到稳定化。硅支持体影响活性位点的组成，从而影响聚合物化的起始。聚合起始机制仍然不清楚，但证据表明它涉及乙烯与催化剂支持物的相互作用以生成类似于其与苯乙烯进行互换反应所需的环辛四烯，进而促进乙烯在活性位点上的消除，导致乙烯的聚合形成。
