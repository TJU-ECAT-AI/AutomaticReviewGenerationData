[1] "The demonstration of the alkylidene ligand as an active site for olefin activation has led to wide acceptance of the Chauvin mechanism for olefin metathesis."
[2] "The mechanism of initiation of polymerization, as well as the influence of the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) on the composition of the active sites, is discussed."
[3] "The precise nature of the initiation is still unclear. However, it seems reasonable to postulate an interaction between ethylene and ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 to generate the chromacyclobutane analogous to that required by its metathetical reaction with styrene (Eq. (8))."
[4] "The distribution of binding constants for C2H4 may also contribute to the broad polydispersities (typically 15 < Mw/Mn < 20) of the polyethylene produced over both single-site ( SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 [59] and heterogeneous Cr/SiO2 catalysts in general."

The document discusses the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported alkylidene complexes, specifically focusing on chromium complexes. The complexes are formed through -H abstraction reactions leading to stable terminal alkylidene structures. These complexes undergo typical reactions like electrophilic cleavage, metathesis exchange, addition of silanes, and oligomerization/polymerization. Notably, the document mentions the role of silica support, particularly its effect on the composition of active sites during polymerization. The initiation of ethylene polymerization over the catalyst involves a fast reaction between ethylene and the alkylidene ligand, leading to the formation of a chromacyclobutane. The document also touches upon the distribution of binding constants for ethylene, which contributes to the polydispersity of the produced polyethylene.

In terms of comparison with silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the document lacks specific details. It focuses primarily on chromium-based alkylidene complexes and their unique reactivities, such as the ability to undergo polymerization initiation. However, it does not provide a direct comparison with zirconium hydrides or thorium hydrides in terms of their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, a detailed comparison between the catalytic properties and mechanisms of these systems is not available within the provided document.

文档讨论了硅基支持的烷基双键复合物的制备、结构和催化性质，特别关注了铬复合物。这些复合物通过-氢抽象反应形成稳定的终端烷基双键结构。这些复合物进行典型的反应，如亲电断裂、互换、添加硅烷和寡聚/聚合。值得注意的是，文档提到了支撑硅的作用，特别是对聚合活性位点组成的影响力。乙烯聚合的启动涉及快速乙烯与烷基双键配体之间的反应，导致形成一个色环四氢化合物。文档还提到乙烷结合常数分布对生成的聚乙烯的多分散性（通常为15 < Mw/Mn < 20）的影响。

关于与硅基支持的锆化氢和氧化铝支持的钍化氢在C-H键激活反应中的比较，文档缺乏具体细节。它主要关注铬基烷基双键复合物及其独特的反应性，例如能够进行聚合初始化的能力。但是，它没有提供直接比较这些系统的方法，尤其是它们在氢/氘交换和烷烃互换中的机制。因此，在提供的文档中，无法获取这些系统的催化性质和机制的详细比较。
