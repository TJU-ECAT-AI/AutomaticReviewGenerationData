[1] "Alkylidene complexes of the early first-row transition metals, when supported on silica, readily form and stabilize rare terminal alkylidene fragments."
[2] "These materials have the empirical formula (SiO)2M=CHEMe3, where M is Ti, V, or Cr and E is C or Si."
[3] "The silica-supported alkylidene complexes undergo several typical reactions, including electrophilic cleavage with H+ and Br2, metathetical exchange with acetone and styrene, and addition of a silane."
[4] "Reaction with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, for which the material with M = Cr is particularly effective."
[5] "The mechanism of initiation of polymerization, as well as the influence of the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) on the composition of the active sites, is discussed."
[6] "Silica-supported complexes derived from VR4 and CrR4 are paramagnetic and give no observable 13C CP/MAS spectra."
[7] "Each of the silica-supported bis(alkyl) metal complexes is stable at room temperature provided it is scrupulously protected from air."
[8] "The reactions occur with a precise stoichiometry, regardless of the loading of the metal complex on silica."
[9] "The -H abstraction reactions of (SiO)2M(CH2EMe3)2 occur at characteristic temperatures, depending on the identities of M and E."
[10] "Reactions of silica-supported alkylidene complexes with electrophiles such as H+ and Br2 are described earlier."
[11] "The pseudo-Wittig reaction of (SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 with acetone yields 2,5,5-trimethylpent-1-ene."
[12] "Olefin metathesis products neohexene and trimethyl-vinylsilane were detected upon reaction of (SiO)2M=CHEMe3 (M = V, Cr) with styrene."
[13] "Ethylene uptake was instead characterized by oligomerization/polymerization."
[14] "For M = Cr, polymerization was rapid and extensive, whereas ethylene uptake self-terminated after addition of ca. 40 eq. C2H4 for M = V and Ti."
[15] "When (SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 was dosed with a very small amount (ca. 1 equivalent) of ethylene, the volatiles detected were primarily the C7 olefins 4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, 4,4-dimethylpent-1-ene and 2,3,3-trimethylbutene."
[16] "Exposure of (SiO)2Cr=CHEMe3 to 100 Torr H2 at room temperature resulted in no discernable reaction."
[17] "Upon heating, the onset of hydrogenation was noted at ca. 150 C, accompanied by formation of volatile hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane and propane in addition to neopentane (E = C) and SiMe4 (E = Si)."
[18] "The presence of a surface Cr hydride was further confirmed by exposure of the sample to CH3I, upon which methane was detected in the gas phase."
[19] "The silica-supported alkylidene complexes described here are not electrophilic enough to activate the CH bonds of arenes."
[20] "The coordination number of the metal in these or the bis(alkyl) complexes which precede them has not yet been established."
[21] "Despite the empirical evidence for formulation of the alkylidene complexes as (SiO)2M=CHEMe3, the coordination number of the metal has not been established."
[22] "Evidence for siloxane participation in the coordination sphere was sought by varying the nature of the silica."
[23] "The precise nature of the initiation is still unclear."
[24] "It seems reasonable to postulate an interaction between ethylene and (SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 to generate the chromacyclobutane analogous to that required by its metathetical reaction with styrene."
[25] "Extrusion of 4,4-dimethylpentenes from an -t-butyltitanacyclobutane has been observed."
[26] "Both find precedent in experimental studies of tantala-cyclobutane decomposition in the presence of olefins."
[27] "Spontaneous extrusion of C7 olefins is thus inferred to precede the formation of polyethylene on the active sites."
[28] "The distribution of binding constants for C2H4 may also contribute to the broad polydispersities (typically 15 < Mw/Mn < 20) of the polyethylene produced over both single-site (SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 and heterogeneous Cr/SiO2 catalysts in general."
[29] "The dis-tribution of binding constants for C2H4 may also contribute to the broad polydispersities (typically 15 < Mw/Mn < 20) of the polyethylene produced over both single-site (SiO)2Cr=CHCMe3 and heterogeneous Cr/SiO2 catalysts in general."
[30] "This phenomenon is suggested to be a consequence of the surface roughness of the silica gel (with a surface fractal dimension close to 3.0 [60]), resulting in greater proximity of adjacent siloxanes to the grafted Cr sites."

Silica-supported alkylidene complexes, especially those of early first-row transition metals, form and stabilize rare terminal alkylidene fragments. These complexes undergo typical reactions like electrophilic cleavage, metathetical exchange, and addition of silanes. Reaction with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, with chromium-based materials being particularly effective. The mechanism of polymerization initiation and the impact of silica support on active site composition are discussed. Fumed and precipitated silica supports affect reaction outcomes differently. The complexes react with electrophiles such as H+ and Br2, undergo metathesis with acetone and styrene, and add silanes. Ethylene causes oligomerization/polymerization, with chromium complexes being particularly efficient. Hydrogenation of the silica-supported complexes requires elevated temperatures and results in various hydride complexes and metal reduction. Exposure to H2 at room temperature does not result in reaction until heating initiates hydrogenation. Surface chromium hydrides are confirmed through methane detection after exposure to CH3I. The complexes are not electrophilic enough to activate arene CH bonds. The coordination number of the metal has not been determined. Varying the silica nature seeks evidence for siloxane participation in the coordination sphere. The precise nature of initiation is unclear, but it involves an interaction between ethylene and the chromium alkylidene complex. The distribution of binding constants for ethylene contributes to the broad polydispersity of the polyethylene produced. The surface roughness of the silica gel influences the proximity of adjacent siloxanes to the grafted chromium sites, affecting polymerization activity.
