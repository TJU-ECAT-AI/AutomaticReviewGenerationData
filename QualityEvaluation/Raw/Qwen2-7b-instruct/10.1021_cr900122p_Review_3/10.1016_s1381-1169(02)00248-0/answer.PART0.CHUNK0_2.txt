[1] "Alkylidene complexes of the early first-row transition metals, when supported on silica, readily form and stabilize rare terminal alkylidene fragments."
[2] "The silica-supported alkylidene complexes undergo several typical reactions, including electrophilic cleavage with H+ and Br2, metathetical exchange with acetone and styrene, and addition of a silane."
[3] "Reaction with ethylene leads to oligomerization/polymerization, for which the material with M = Cr is particularly effective."
[4] "The mechanism of initiation of polymerization, as well as the influence of the silica support (fumed versus precipitated) on the composition of the active sites, is discussed."
[5] "The silica-supported alkylidene complexes are not electrophilic enough to activate the CH bonds of arenes."
[6] "The coordination number of the metal in these or the bis(alkyl) complexes which precede them has not yet been established."
[7] "The precise nature of the initiation is still unclear."
[8] "The inability of a substantial fraction of neopentylidene sites to add ethylene, despite the presumed facility of this reaction, suggests that initiation is inhibited by another, stronger interaction."
[9] "This phenomenon is suggested to be a consequence of the surface roughness of the silica gel (with a surface fractal dimension close to 3.0 [60]), resulting in greater proximity of adjacent siloxanes to the grafted Cr sites."

Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, the key differences lie in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are formed through the grafting of zirconium hydrides onto the silica surface, leading to the stabilization of alkylidene fragments. This process enables the activation of C-H bonds through reactions such as electrophilic cleavage, metathesis, and addition of silanes. The silica support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the zirconium hydrides, allowing for efficient C-H bond activation.

In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides involve the deposition of thorium hydrides on alumina. The alumina support facilitates the anchoring of thorium hydrides, enabling their use in C-H bond activation reactions. The structure of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of the support, with the alumina providing a framework for the dispersed thorium hydrides.

Regarding reaction rates, selectivity, and mechanisms, silica-supported zirconium hydrides typically exhibit faster rates due to the enhanced surface area provided by the silica support. This results in higher reaction rates and improved selectivity. The mechanism of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involves the coordination of hydrogen atoms and the rearrangement of alkane molecules, facilitated by the zirconium hydrides.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides, on the other hand, may exhibit slower reaction rates due to the larger particle size of alumina. However, they offer robustness against poisoning and are capable of maintaining activity over extended periods. The mechanism of C-H bond activation in these systems involves the coordination of thorium hydrides with alkane molecules, leading to bond breaking and formation.

Chain walking in these processes refers to the sequential activation and recombination of alkane molecules. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides tend to show more efficient chain walking due to the higher reactivity of zirconium hydrides. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides may exhibit less pronounced chain walking due to the larger size of thorium hydrides.

In summary, silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides differ in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties, with zirconium hydrides offering faster reaction rates and higher selectivity, while thorium hydrides provide robustness against poisoning. The mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis involve coordination and rearrangement of alkane molecules, facilitated by the respective hydrides.

The silica support in zirconium hydrides and the alumina support in thorium hydrides play critical roles in stabilizing the hydrides and influencing the reaction pathways. The coordination number of the metals in these complexes remains uncertain, and the initiation mechanisms are not fully understood. The surface roughness of the supports impacts the proximity of siloxanes to the grafted metals, influencing the activation of C-H bonds.
