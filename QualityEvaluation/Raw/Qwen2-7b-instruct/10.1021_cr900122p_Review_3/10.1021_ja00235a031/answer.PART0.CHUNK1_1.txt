The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions differ significantly. 

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate high catalytic activity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis through hydrogenolysis and chain walking mechanisms. The selectivity for H/D exchange is attributed to the unique Lewis acidity of thorium, enabling efficient hydrogen incorporation. 

Conversely, silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit moderate to high activity in alkane metathesis reactions, showing distinct selectivity towards the formation of shorter alkane chains. The stability of the zirconium hydride surface, which facilitates the formation of active metathesis sites, explains the high activity in alkane metathesis.

Both catalysts rely on σ-bond metathesis, a crucial process for rearranging alkyl groups during the metathesis process. The differences in the mechanisms and selectivities highlight the importance of the support material and the nature of the metal hydride in determining the catalytic behavior in C-H bond activation reactions.

在C-H键激活反应中，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物和硅胶支持的锆氢化物的制备、结构和催化性质存在显著差异。  

氧化铝支持的钍氢化物表现出高催化活性，在H/D交换和烷烃互换反应中通过氢解离和链行走机制。H/D交换的选择性归因于钍的独特Lewis酸性，使氢的整合更加有效。  

相反，硅胶支持的锆氢化物在烷烃互换反应中的活性适度至高，显示出对较短烷烃链形成的独特选择性。锆氢化物表面的稳定性，促进了形成活性互换位点，解释了在烷烃互换反应中的高活性。

两种催化剂均依赖σ键互换，这是在互换过程中重组烷基团的关键过程。机制和选择性的差异突显了支持材料和金属氢化物的性质对于C-H键激活反应催化行为的重要性。
