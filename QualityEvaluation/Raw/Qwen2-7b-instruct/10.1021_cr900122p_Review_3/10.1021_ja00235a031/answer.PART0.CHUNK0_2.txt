[1] "Alumina-supported thorium hydrides have been successfully employed in various C-H bond activation reactions, including H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. These reactions are facilitated through a combination of mechanisms, including σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking."
[2] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides, on the other hand, are known for their catalytic activity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. They enable efficient hydrogenation of alkenes and deuterium incorporation into various substrates."
[3] "In terms of reaction rates, alumina-supported thorium hydrides tend to exhibit higher turnover frequencies due to their strong interaction with the substrate, resulting in faster activation of C-H bonds. Meanwhile, silica-supported zirconium hydrides offer better selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions, with controlled chain walking leading to the formation of specific alkane products."
[4] "Selectivity in C-H bond activation is influenced by the nature of the support material. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides display broad selectivity, capable of activating a wide range of C-H bonds, while silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrate enhanced selectivity towards specific functional groups or types of C-H bonds."

1. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides have been utilized effectively in C-H bond activation reactions, encompassing H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. These processes are enabled through a mix of mechanisms, including σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Meanwhile, silica-supported zirconium hydrides are renowned for their catalytic activity in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, facilitating efficient hydrogenation of alkenes and deuterium incorporation into various substrates.

2. In terms of reaction rates, alumina-supported thorium hydrides tend to exhibit higher turnover frequencies due to their strong interaction with the substrate, leading to faster activation of C-H bonds. In contrast, silica-supported zirconium hydrides offer better selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions, with controlled chain walking resulting in the formation of specific alkane products.

3. Selectivity in C-H bond activation is influenced by the support material. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides display broad selectivity, capable of activating a wide range of C-H bonds. Conversely, silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrate enhanced selectivity towards specific functional groups or types of C-H bonds.

1. 铝酸盐支持的钍氢化物在各种C-H键激活反应中已被成功应用，包括H/D交换和烷烃裂解。这些过程通过σ键互换、氢解和链行走等机制得以促进。另一方面，硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物因其催化活性而在H/D交换和烷烃裂解中受到青睐，能够高效地氢化烯烃并使deuterium掺入各种基质。

2. 在反应速率方面，铝酸盐支持的钍氢化物倾向于表现出更高的周转频率，由于它们与基质的强烈相互作用，导致C-H键更快地被激活。相比之下，硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物在烷烃裂解反应中提供更好的选择性，通过受控的链行走形成特定的烷烃产物。

3. C-H键激活的选择性受支持材料的影响。铝酸盐支持的钍氢化物显示广泛的选择性，能够激活各种C-H键。相反，硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物显示出对特定功能团或C-H键类型的增强选择性。
