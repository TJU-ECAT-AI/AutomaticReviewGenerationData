The literature discusses the synthesis and properties of various alkyl derivatives of permethylscandocene, including Cp*,ScCH3, Cp*,ScCH2CH3, and Cp*,ScCH3(THF). The geometry of Cp*,ScCH3 (2) is normal, with a Sc-CH3 distance of 2.24(1) Å and an average Sc-C(Cp*) distance of 2.46(1) Å. The structure of Cp*,Sc(C,N-q2-C5H4N) (11) was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, providing insights into the bonding and structure of these compounds.
