[1] "Alkyl derivatives of permethylscandocene are formally 14-electron compounds and, hence, are very electron deficient."
[2] "Compound 1 is obtained, together with its T H F  adduct (THF = tetrahydrofuran), when solvent is re- moved from a reaction mixture consisting of ScC13(THF), and 2 equiv of LiCp*, which has been heated at reflux for 3 days in xylenes (eq 2)."
[3] "Cp*,ScCI readily undergoes straightforward12 metathetical reactions with main group organometallic compounds."
[4] "Cp*,ScCH, (2), CP*,SCCHS"
[5] "Cp*,ScCH3 (2) coordinates THF tightly enough to allow crystallization of analytically pure samples of Cp*2ScCH3(THF),even in the ab- sence of excess THF, illustrating the delicate balance betwen steric and electronic factors for these permethylscandocene complexes."
[6] "These 14-electron hydrocarbyl derivatives of permethyl- scandocene have very crowded coordination spheres, as illustrated by their resistance to aggregation in solution and their poor af- finities for bases."
[7] "The characterization of unstable [Cp*,ScH],, (6) is based on the following: (i) for R = CH2C6H5 in reaction 5, 0.93 equiv of dihydrogen is consumed (Toepler pump analysis), and 1 .O equiv of CH3C6H5 ('H NMR) is formed;"

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are not mentioned in the provided document. Therefore, I cannot compare and contrast their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions, including their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes. The document focuses on the synthesis and reactivity of permethylscandocene derivatives rather than zirconium or thorium hydrides.

硅基载铂氢化物和氧化铝基载钍氢化物在文档中未提及，因此我无法比较和对比它们在C-H键激活反应中的制备、结构和催化特性，包括它们在H/D交换和烷烃转位中的机制、反应速率、选择性以及σ键转位、氢解离和链行走在这些过程中的作用。文档主要关注了二甲基丙烷衍生物的合成及其反应性，而不是铂或钍氢化物。
