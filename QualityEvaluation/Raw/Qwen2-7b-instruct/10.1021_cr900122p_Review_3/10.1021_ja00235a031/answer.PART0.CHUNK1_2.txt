(42) The general reaction (eq 42) illustrates the (R = H, alkyl, aryl; A-B = H-H, sp C-H, sp2 C-H, sp3 C-H, C-X, X-C; X = halide) broad scope of these u bond metathesis processes, several of which have been utilized as convenient syntheses for some of the de- rivatives reported herein.

(53) The d(Sc-H) distances are, in fact, identical (see ref 52); however, frontier orbital considerations reveal that no formal bond between the Sc and the P-H exists: the four electrons (one each from the three hydrogens and one from Sc) occupy the orbitals of la, and b, symmetry; the remaining orbital, of 2a, symmetry (that which is bonding with respect to Sc and the 8-H) is thus empty.

(56) Although alkyl-alkyl coupling of alkanes to higher alkanes and di- hydrogen is slightly endothermic, it is apparently very much disfavored kinetically: no homogeneous system which effects this transformation has been reported to our knowledge.

(60) The much higher reactivity of H2 and the preferential formation of tolyl rather than benzyl isomers in the reaction of 2 with toluene are not easily reconciled, however, pK,(H2) z pK,(C,H,) = 37, pK,(C6HSCH3) = 35.

The literature discusses the broad scope of u bond metathesis processes, showing their utility in synthesizing various derivatives. It explains the transition state stability depending on orbital character. It also mentions the kinetic disfavorability of alkyl-alkyl coupling reactions. There are references to kinetic studies on alkyl halide reactions and the preference for tolyl over benzyl isomers in reactions with toluene. The acidity of different C-H bonds is compared in these contexts.
