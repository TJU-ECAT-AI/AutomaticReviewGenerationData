The study investigated the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported tantalum hydrides for methane activation, specifically focusing on their performance in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. The researchers prepared the catalysts by impregnating mesoporous silica with tantalum tetrachloride and reducing it with hydrogen gas. The structure of the catalysts was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while their thermal stability was assessed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The activation of methane occurred in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures from 250 to 450°C under an inert atmosphere, with the selectivity towards ethane formation determined by gas chromatography (GC). The thermal evolution of the tantalum-methyl species was monitored using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results demonstrated that the silica-supported tantalum hydrides showed high activity and selectivity for ethane formation.

该研究探讨了二氧化硅负载钽化氢的制备、结构和催化性质，特别关注其在H/D交换和烷烃裂解反应中的性能。研究人员通过将四氯化钽浸渍到介孔二氧化硅中并用氢气还原来制备催化剂。催化剂的结构通过X射线衍射（XRD）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）进行表征，而热稳定性则通过热重分析（TGA）评估。在250至450°C的惰性气氛下，在固定床反应器中对甲烷进行了激活，通过气相色谱（GC）确定了乙烷形成的选择性。通过气相色谱联用质谱（GC-MS）监测了钽-甲基物种的热演化。结果显示，二氧化硅负载的钽化氢表现出高活性和乙烷形成的选择性。
