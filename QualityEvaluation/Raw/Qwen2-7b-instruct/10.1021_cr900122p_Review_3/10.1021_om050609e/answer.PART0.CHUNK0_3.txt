Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides, both catalysts were prepared and characterized for their ability to activate C-H bonds in methane and other hydrocarbons through H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides showed distinct catalytic properties in terms of reaction rates and selectivity compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The mechanisms involved in these processes included σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which played significant roles in determining the efficiency and specificity of the catalytic activity. However, detailed comparisons regarding the structure of the catalysts and their specific roles in these chemical transformations require further analysis of the experimental data presented in the study.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物，这两种催化剂被准备并表征以激活甲烷和其他烃中的C-H键通过H/D交换和烷烃重排反应。二氧化硅支持的锆化物在反应速率和选择性方面与氧化铝支持的钍化物表现出不同的催化特性。这些过程的机制包括σ键重排、氢解离和链行走，在确定催化活性的效率和特异性方面起着重要作用。然而，需要进一步分析研究中提供的实验数据，以详细比较催化剂的结构及其在这些化学转化中的特定作用。
