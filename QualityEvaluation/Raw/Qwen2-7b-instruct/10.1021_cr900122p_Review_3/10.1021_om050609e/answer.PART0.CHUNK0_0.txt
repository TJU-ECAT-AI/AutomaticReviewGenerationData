The silica-supported zirconium hydride and alumina-supported thorium hydride were prepared differently, with the former being impregnated onto MCM-41 mesoporous silica and the latter synthesized through thorium(IV) oxide reaction with a hydrosilicate solution under high temperature and pressure. In terms of methane activation, the silica-supported zirconium hydride underwent hydrogenation followed by H/D exchange, while the alumina-supported thorium hydride went through hydrogenolysis followed by chain walking. The zirconium hydride catalyst had faster reaction rates in the H/D exchange process, whereas the thorium hydride was more selective for alkane metathesis. Both catalysts preferred σ-bond metathesis over hydrogenolysis in the alkane activation process.

这两种催化剂的制备方法不同，硅酸盐支持的锆化物通过将氯化锆溶液浸渍到MCM-41介孔硅上进行制备，而氧化钍支持的铝化物则通过在高温高压条件下反应氧化钍(IV)氧化物与水合硅酸盐溶液来合成。对于甲烷激活过程，硅酸盐支持的锆化物经历了氢化后接着进行H/D交换，而氧化钍支持的铝化物则经历了氢解然后是链行走。锆化物催化剂在H/D交换过程中具有更快的反应速率，而钍化物催化剂在烷烃裂解过程中更具有选择性。两种催化剂都偏好σ键裂解而不是氢解，在烷烃激活过程中。
