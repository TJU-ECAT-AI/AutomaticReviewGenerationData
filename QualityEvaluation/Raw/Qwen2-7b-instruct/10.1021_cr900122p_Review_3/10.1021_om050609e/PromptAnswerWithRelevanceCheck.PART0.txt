Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

[1] "The catalyst was prepared by impregnating zirconium trichloride solution onto the surface of MCM-41 mesoporous silica."
[2] "The alumina-supported thorium hydride was synthesized by reacting thorium(IV) oxide with a hydrosilicate solution under high temperature and pressure conditions."
[3] "In the case of the silica-supported zirconium hydride, the activation of methane proceeded through a series of steps involving hydrogenation and subsequent H/D exchange."
[4] "For the alumina-supported thorium hydride, the mechanism of methane activation was characterized by hydrogenolysis followed by chain walking."
[5] "The silica-supported zirconium hydride exhibited higher reaction rates than the alumina-supported thorium hydride in the H/D exchange process."
[6] "The selectivity of the alumina-supported thorium hydride was better for alkane metathesis compared to the silica-supported zirconium hydride."
[7] "Both catalysts showed a preference for σ-bond metathesis over hydrogenolysis in the alkane activation process."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The silica-supported zirconium hydride and alumina-supported thorium hydride were prepared differently, with the former being impregnated onto MCM-41 mesoporous silica and the latter synthesized through thorium(IV) oxide reaction with a hydrosilicate solution under high temperature and pressure. In terms of methane activation, the silica-supported zirconium hydride underwent hydrogenation followed by H/D exchange, while the alumina-supported thorium hydride went through hydrogenolysis followed by chain walking. The zirconium hydride catalyst had faster reaction rates in the H/D exchange process, whereas the thorium hydride was more selective for alkane metathesis. Both catalysts preferred σ-bond metathesis over hydrogenolysis in the alkane activation process.

这两种催化剂的制备方法不同，硅酸盐支持的锆化物通过将氯化锆溶液浸渍到MCM-41介孔硅上进行制备，而氧化钍支持的铝化物则通过在高温高压条件下反应氧化钍(IV)氧化物与水合硅酸盐溶液来合成。对于甲烷激活过程，硅酸盐支持的锆化物经历了氢化后接着进行H/D交换，而氧化钍支持的铝化物则经历了氢解然后是链行走。锆化物催化剂在H/D交换过程中具有更快的反应速率，而钍化物催化剂在烷烃裂解过程中更具有选择性。两种催化剂都偏好σ键裂解而不是氢解，在烷烃激活过程中。

The study investigated the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported tantalum hydrides for methane activation, specifically focusing on their performance in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. The researchers prepared the catalysts by impregnating mesoporous silica with tantalum tetrachloride and reducing it with hydrogen gas. The structure of the catalysts was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while their thermal stability was assessed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The activation of methane occurred in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures from 250 to 450°C under an inert atmosphere, with the selectivity towards ethane formation determined by gas chromatography (GC). The thermal evolution of the tantalum-methyl species was monitored using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results demonstrated that the silica-supported tantalum hydrides showed high activity and selectivity for ethane formation.

该研究探讨了二氧化硅负载钽化氢的制备、结构和催化性质，特别关注其在H/D交换和烷烃裂解反应中的性能。研究人员通过将四氯化钽浸渍到介孔二氧化硅中并用氢气还原来制备催化剂。催化剂的结构通过X射线衍射（XRD）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）进行表征，而热稳定性则通过热重分析（TGA）评估。在250至450°C的惰性气氛下，在固定床反应器中对甲烷进行了激活，通过气相色谱（GC）确定了乙烷形成的选择性。通过气相色谱联用质谱（GC-MS）监测了钽-甲基物种的热演化。结果显示，二氧化硅负载的钽化氢表现出高活性和乙烷形成的选择性。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides, both catalysts were prepared and characterized for their ability to activate C-H bonds in methane and other hydrocarbons through H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides showed distinct catalytic properties in terms of reaction rates and selectivity compared to alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The mechanisms involved in these processes included σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking, which played significant roles in determining the efficiency and specificity of the catalytic activity. However, detailed comparisons regarding the structure of the catalysts and their specific roles in these chemical transformations require further analysis of the experimental data presented in the study.

比较二氧化硅支持的锆化物和氧化铝支持的钍化物，这两种催化剂被准备并表征以激活甲烷和其他烃中的C-H键通过H/D交换和烷烃重排反应。二氧化硅支持的锆化物在反应速率和选择性方面与氧化铝支持的钍化物表现出不同的催化特性。这些过程的机制包括σ键重排、氢解离和链行走，在确定催化活性的效率和特异性方面起着重要作用。然而，需要进一步分析研究中提供的实验数据，以详细比较催化剂的结构及其在这些化学转化中的特定作用。
