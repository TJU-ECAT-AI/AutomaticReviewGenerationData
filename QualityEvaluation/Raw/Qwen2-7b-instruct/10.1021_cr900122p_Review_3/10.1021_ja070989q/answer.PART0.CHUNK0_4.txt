The study compared silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in terms of their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibited higher activity in H/D exchange reactions, while alumina-supported thorium hydrides showed better selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions. The mechanisms involved σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Reaction rates and selectivities differed based on the support material and the type of reaction.
