Comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides, the literature highlights their differences in preparation, structure, and catalytic properties. The mechanisms for H/D exchange and alkane metathesis are explored, along with the factors affecting reaction rates and selectivity. The roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes are also discussed.
