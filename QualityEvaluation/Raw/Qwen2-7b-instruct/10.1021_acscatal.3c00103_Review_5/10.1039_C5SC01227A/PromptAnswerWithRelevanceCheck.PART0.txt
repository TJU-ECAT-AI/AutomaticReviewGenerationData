[1] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides.6 However, the nature of atomic structure of these promoters during the dehydrogenation process is still under debate."
[3] "The binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol−1 after alloying different amounts of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up (Fig. 12), including deep dehydrogenation from propylene."
[4] "It has been shown that during the Ni-catalyzed water-gas shift reaction, less coke is expected to form at terrace sites of the catalyst compared to the situation at steps, as the flat surface is less active for the formation of C centers via CO scission."

Researchers are addressing the challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by focusing on catalysts that offer high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. The primary opportunities lie in developing catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene with minimal coke formation, a major hindrance in industrial production. 

One key strategy involves using catalysts like supported platinum (Pt) or chromium oxide (CrOx), which show high activity but struggle with deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers are also exploring the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals like tin (Sn) and gallium (Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides. These additives can enhance the catalyst's robustness against coking, though the precise atomic structure of the promoters during the dehydrogenation process remains a subject of ongoing debate.

To improve propylene selectivity, researchers are investigating the use of alloy catalysts, particularly those containing tin (Sn) in platinum (Pt). Alloying Sn in Pt(111) reduces the binding energy of propylene by at least 8 kJ/mol−1, while increasing the dehydrogenation barriers across the process. This not only enhances propylene selectivity but also promotes resistance against side reactions.

Furthermore, the design of catalyst surfaces plays a crucial role in reducing coke formation. Studies suggest that during the Ni-catalyzed water-gas shift reaction, coke formation is less pronounced at terrace sites of the catalyst compared to step sites. This indicates that the surface geometry can significantly influence the catalytic activity and coke formation, offering a promising avenue for optimizing catalyst design.

研究人员正在通过专注于提供高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和抗副反应能力的催化剂来解决丙烷脱氢(PDH)的挑战。主要的机会在于开发能够有效将丙烷转化为丙烯并最小化焦炭形成（工业生产中的一个主要障碍）的催化剂。

关键策略之一涉及使用如支持型铂(Pt)或铬氧化物(CrOx)等催化剂，它们在活性方面表现出色，但面临着由于焦炭形成而导致的催化剂失活问题。研究者还在探索使用其他添加剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属（如锡(Sn)和镓(Ga)）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物。这些添加物可以增强催化剂对焦炭形成的耐受性，尽管促进剂在脱氢过程中的原子结构仍然是争论的话题。

为了提高丙烯选择性，研究者正在调查合金催化剂的应用，特别是包含锡(Sn)的铂(Pt)合金。在Pt(111)中添加Sn可以降低丙烯的吸附能至少8 kJ/mol−1，同时增加整个过程的脱氢壁垒。这不仅增强了丙烯的选择性，而且也促进了对抗副反应的能力。

此外，催化剂表面的设计在减少焦炭形成方面起着关键作用。研究表明，在镍催化水煤气变换反应期间，焦炭形成在催化剂的台阶位点上比在步位点上少得多。这表明表面几何形状可以显著影响催化活性和焦炭形成，为优化催化剂设计提供了有希望的方向。

1. Researchers address the challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production by utilizing a variety of catalysts. Supported platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) are commonly used. Platinum catalysts exhibit high activity but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke formation. To counteract this, researchers incorporate additional promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (including tin (Sn) and gallium (Ga)), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides. These additives help increase the stability of the catalyst against coking. However, the precise atomic structure of these promoters during the dehydrogenation process remains a subject of ongoing debate.

2. The primary challenges in PDH include maintaining high-temperature stability, ensuring high selectivity towards propylene, and preventing unwanted side reactions, particularly coke formation. The high endothermic nature of the PDH reaction, with a ΔH298K of 124 kJ/mol, means that high temperatures facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene. However, these elevated temperatures also increase the likelihood of undesired deep dehydrogenation reactions, which can lead to the formation of coke and compromise the catalyst's performance. Researchers are actively exploring ways to optimize catalyst composition and structure to balance high activity with stability, selectivity, and resistance to coke formation, while also considering thermodynamic constraints to ensure efficient and sustainable propylene production.

1. 研究人员通过使用多种催化剂来解决工业丙烯生产中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）挑战。常用的催化剂包括支持的铂（Pt）和铬酸盐（CrOx）。铂催化剂表现出高活性，但催化剂因焦炭形成而快速失效。为了对抗这一问题，研究人员引入了额外的促进剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属（包括锡（Sn）和镓（Ga））、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物。这些添加剂有助于增加催化剂抵抗结焦的能力。然而，这些促进剂在脱氢过程中的精确原子结构仍然是一个正在讨论的话题。

2. PDH的主要挑战包括保持高温稳定性、确保高丙烯选择性以及防止不希望的副反应，特别是焦炭形成。PDH反应的高热力学吸热性，ΔH298K为124 kJ/mol，意味着高温有利于丙烷转化为丙烯。但是，这些升高的温度也增加了不希望的深度脱氢反应的可能性，这可能导致焦炭形成并损害催化剂性能。研究人员正在积极探索优化催化剂组成和结构的方法，以平衡高活性与稳定性和选择性的关系，并考虑热力学约束，以确保高效和可持续的丙烯生产。
