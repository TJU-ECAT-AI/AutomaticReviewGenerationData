[1] "Along with the decreasing fossil oil reserves and development on utilization of nature gas and shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) seems to be a promising alternative to produce propylene."
[2] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[3] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps."

Researchers are addressing the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by studying the performance of different catalysts and their mechanisms. They categorize commercial PDH catalysts into chromium-based and platinum-based catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts face issues with low selectivity to propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Detailed studies on the dehydrogenation steps on Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211) surfaces provide insights into the mechanisms and help in identifying catalysts that can overcome these challenges.

研究人员通过研究不同催化剂及其机制，来解决丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抗副反应需求。他们将商用PDH催化剂分为铬基和铂基催化剂。铂基催化剂面临丙烯选择性低和快速失活的问题，这是由于焦炭形成造成的。对Pt(111)、Pt(100)和Pt(211)表面的脱氢步骤的详细研究提供了机制见解，并有助于识别可以克服这些挑战的催化剂。
