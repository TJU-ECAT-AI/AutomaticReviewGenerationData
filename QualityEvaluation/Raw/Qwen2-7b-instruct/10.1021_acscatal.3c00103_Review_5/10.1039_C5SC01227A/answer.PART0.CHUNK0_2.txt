[1] "Along with the decreasing fossil oil reserves and development on utilization of nature gas and shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) seems to be a promising alternative to produce propylene."
[2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps."
[3] "The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
[4] "The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are the low selectivity of the catalyst to propylene and the fast deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers are addressing these issues by developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, improved propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. They are considering thermodynamic limitations to ensure efficient and controlled dehydrogenation processes.
