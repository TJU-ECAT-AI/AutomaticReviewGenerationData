[1] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
[2] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol−1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."
[3] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
[4] "However, the nature of atomic structure of these promoters during the dehydrogenation process is still under debate."

Researchers are addressing the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by using supported Pt or CrOx catalysts. They are enhancing the catalyst robustness against coke formation through the use of additional promoters like late transition metals, main-group metals, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, the atomic structure of these promoters during the dehydrogenation process remains a matter of debate.

研究人员通过使用支持Pt或CrOx催化剂来解决丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抗副反应需求。他们通过添加晚期过渡金属、主族金属、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物等促进剂来增强催化剂的抗结焦能力。然而，这些促进剂在脱氢过程中的原子结构仍存在争议。
