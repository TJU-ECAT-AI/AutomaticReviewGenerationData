[1] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides.6 However, the nature of atomic structure of these promoters during the dehydrogenation process is still under debate."
[3] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

1. Researchers address the challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production by utilizing a variety of catalysts. Supported platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) are commonly used. Platinum catalysts exhibit high activity but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke formation. To counteract this, researchers incorporate additional promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (including tin (Sn) and gallium (Ga)), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides. These additives help increase the stability of the catalyst against coking. However, the precise atomic structure of these promoters during the dehydrogenation process remains a subject of ongoing debate.

2. The primary challenges in PDH include maintaining high-temperature stability, ensuring high selectivity towards propylene, and preventing unwanted side reactions, particularly coke formation. The high endothermic nature of the PDH reaction, with a ΔH298K of 124 kJ/mol, means that high temperatures facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene. However, these elevated temperatures also increase the likelihood of undesired deep dehydrogenation reactions, which can lead to the formation of coke and compromise the catalyst's performance. Researchers are actively exploring ways to optimize catalyst composition and structure to balance high activity with stability, selectivity, and resistance to coke formation, while also considering thermodynamic constraints to ensure efficient and sustainable propylene production.

1. 研究人员通过使用多种催化剂来解决工业丙烯生产中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）挑战。常用的催化剂包括支持的铂（Pt）和铬酸盐（CrOx）。铂催化剂表现出高活性，但催化剂因焦炭形成而快速失效。为了对抗这一问题，研究人员引入了额外的促进剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属（包括锡（Sn）和镓（Ga））、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物。这些添加剂有助于增加催化剂抵抗结焦的能力。然而，这些促进剂在脱氢过程中的精确原子结构仍然是一个正在讨论的话题。

2. PDH的主要挑战包括保持高温稳定性、确保高丙烯选择性以及防止不希望的副反应，特别是焦炭形成。PDH反应的高热力学吸热性，ΔH298K为124 kJ/mol，意味着高温有利于丙烷转化为丙烯。但是，这些升高的温度也增加了不希望的深度脱氢反应的可能性，这可能导致焦炭形成并损害催化剂性能。研究人员正在积极探索优化催化剂组成和结构的方法，以平衡高活性与稳定性和选择性的关系，并考虑热力学约束，以确保高效和可持续的丙烯生产。
