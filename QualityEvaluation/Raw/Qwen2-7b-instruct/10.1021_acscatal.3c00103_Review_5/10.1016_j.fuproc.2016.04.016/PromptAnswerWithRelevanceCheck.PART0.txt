<quotes>
Lower alkanes are readily available feedstocks from petroleum and gas resources. They are potential precursors to many value-added chemicals. However, there are very few commercial processes based on direct conversion of light alkanes to valuable chemicals. Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons [1] . Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents). Chemical processing under these severe conditions typically require large capital investments.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are the thermodynamic limitations and kinetic complications associated with the activation of the CH bond. The process is endothermic, requiring a significant amount of energy input. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures and with higher propylene selectivity. High-temperature stability, resistance to side reactions, and the ability to resist coke formation are crucial attributes for PDH catalysts. The literature discusses the use of zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, to enhance stability and improve propene selectivity. The role of exchanged metals like Ga and Zn in promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage is also highlighted. Additionally, the use of Pt-exchanged Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts is noted for their high stability in dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）用于工业丙烯生产的过程中，主要挑战是与CH键活化相关的热力学限制和动力学复杂性。该过程是吸热的，需要大量的能量输入。研究人员通过开发可以在较低温度下运行并具有更高丙烯选择性的催化剂来应对这些挑战。PDH催化剂的高温度稳定性、抵抗副反应的能力以及对焦炭形成的抵抗力是至关重要的属性。文献中讨论了使用沸石，如H-ZSM-5，以提高稳定性并改善丙烯选择性的作用。交换金属如镓和锌在促进从CH断裂形成H原子的再组合脱附中的作用也得到了强调。此外，使用Pt交换的Na-[Fe]ZSM-5催化剂被指出对于轻烷烃的脱氢具有出色的稳定性。

High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart [53] . The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate [57] . A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart.

When exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by zinc (Zn) or gallium (Ga) on H-ZSM-5, high alkene selectivities are achieved. The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 shows higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity compared to the Ga counterpart. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site occurs via a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, which involves conversion of the Lewis base site into a conjugate Bronsted acid site. On the other hand, the OGa+ site activates the CH bond through oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. The presence of a protonic site intermediate increases the likelihood of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 compared to the Ga counterpart.

当将可交换质子在H-ZSM-5上严格替换为锌（Zn）或镓（Ga）时，可以获得高烯烃选择性。Zn交换的H-ZSM-5显示出更高的乙烷转化率但更低的乙烯选择性，与Ga对应物相比。在OZn2+O位点上，CH激活通过亲核基团辅助去质子化机制发生，这涉及将亲核基团位点转化为共轭布伦斯特酸位点。另一方面，OGa+位点通过氧化加成激活CH键，而无需质子性位点中间体。存在质子性位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5上的副反应倾向，与Ga对应物相比。

Despite the high alkene selectivity rate obtained with Pt-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, the corresponding yield of alkenes is generally low due to an equilibrium constraint. Selective combustion of hydrogen will not only drive the equilibrium forward, it will also offset part of the energy input for the endothermic dehydrogenation. Selective hydrogen combustion and dehydrogenation can be accomplished with a single catalyst or a multi-catalyst system.

While Pt-based catalysts offer high alkene selectivity rates for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, the corresponding alkene yield is often low due to thermodynamic constraints. Selective hydrogen combustion can push the equilibrium forward and compensate for part of the energy input required for the endothermic dehydrogenation process. This can be achieved through the use of a single catalyst or a multi-catalyst system.

Researchers are addressing the challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production by focusing on developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Challenges include achieving high selectivity for propylene production amidst competing reactions, maintaining catalyst stability at high temperatures, and minimizing side reactions that degrade product quality. Opportunities arise from advancements in materials science and catalysis research.

For high-temperature stability, researchers are exploring materials like ceria (CeO2) and metal-doped ceria, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen at typical PDH temperatures, reducing the need for external heating. For propylene selectivity, catalysts with optimized active sites, such as those found in zeolites and metal oxides, are being developed. Zeolites, in particular, offer a framework to incorporate exchangeable cations that can polarize alkane molecules and facilitate CH bond activation. Researchers are also leveraging metal doping to tailor the redox properties and surface chemistry of catalysts, enhancing propylene selectivity.

To address resistance to side reactions, catalyst design is focusing on reducing acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can promote unwanted reactions like cracking and aromatization. This is achieved through careful selection of support materials and cation exchange, as seen with the use of weaker basicity cations like boron (B) in borosilicate zeolites. Additionally, researchers are investigating the use of metal clusters and nanostructured catalysts to optimize the surface area and reduce the risk of coke formation.

Innovations in catalyst design, such as the use of porous copper-aluminum framework materials stabilized by metal oxides, promise improved performance for PDH. These materials offer better dispersion of active sites and potentially more efficient hydrogen removal, leading to higher propylene yields and selectivity. The use of advanced reactor configurations, like membrane reactors, is also being explored to enhance heat recovery and reduce the need for external energy inputs, further optimizing the PDH process.

By integrating insights from heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, researchers aim to develop catalysts that mimic the efficient CH bond activation mechanisms found in enzymes, leading to more effective and sustainable PDH processes. The use of computational methods to predict catalyst performance and guide material synthesis is becoming increasingly prevalent, accelerating the pace of innovation in this field.

研究人员正在通过开发具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和对副反应抵抗力的催化剂，同时考虑热力学限制，来解决丙烷脱氢（PDH）工业丙烯生产的挑战。挑战包括在竞争反应中实现高丙烯选择性生产，保持催化剂在高温下的稳定性，并减少可能降低产品质量的副反应。

为了提高高温稳定性，研究人员正在探索像氧化铈（CeO2）和金属氧化物这样的材料，它们可以在典型的PDH温度下选择性地氧化氢，从而减少对外部加热的需求。为了提高丙烯选择性，正在开发具有优化活性位点的催化剂，如在沸石和金属氧化物中的那些。沸石特别提供了框架来引入可交换的阳离子，这些阳离子可以极化烷烃分子并促进CH键活化。研究人员还利用金属掺杂来调整催化剂的还原性质和表面化学，增强丙烯选择性。

为了应对副反应的抵抗力，催化剂设计正在集中于减少催化剂表面上的酸位，这可以促进不希望的反应如裂解和芳构化。这是通过精心选择支持材料和离子交换来实现的，例如在硼硅酸盐沸石中使用较弱基本性的离子，如硼（B）。此外，研究人员正在研究金属簇和纳米结构催化剂的应用，以优化表面积并降低焦炭形成的风险。

创新的催化剂设计，如通过金属氧化物稳定化的多孔铜-铝框架材料，为PDH提供更好的性能承诺。这些材料提供了活性位点的更好分散，并可能更有效地去除氢气，从而提高丙烯产量和选择性。高级反应配置的使用，如膜反应器，也被探索以增强热量回收并减少对外部能量输入的需求，进一步优化PDH过程。

通过结合异相催化和均相催化的知识，研究人员旨在开发模仿酶中高效的CH键激活机制的催化剂，从而实现更有效和可持续的PDH流程。计算方法的使用来预测催化剂性能并指导材料合成正在变得越来越普遍，加速了这一领域的创新速度。

Researchers are facing the challenge of developing PDH catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. The primary opportunities lie in the advancement of catalyst design, specifically in the use of zeolites, metal oxides, and halide-containing catalysts. Zeolites offer a well-defined structure that allows for the elucidation of structure-activity relationships, potentially leading to more efficient catalysts. Metal oxides like vanadium and niobium, when doped with lithium or halides, show promise in improving alkene selectivity. Halide-promoted catalysts, such as Li/MgO and CeO2/2CeF3, have been shown to enhance propene selectivity, although reaction temperatures tend to be higher. Researchers are also exploring the potential of creating active site mimics in solid frameworks to mimic enzyme-like properties for efficient CH activation and alkane dehydrogenation. This approach could address the thermodynamic limitations by achieving activation at milder conditions.
