Lower alkanes are readily available feedstocks from petroleum and gas resources. They are potential precursors to many value-added chemicals. However, there are very few commercial processes based on direct conversion of light alkanes to valuable chemicals. Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons [1] . Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents). Chemical processing under these severe conditions typically require large capital investments.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are the thermodynamic limitations and kinetic complications associated with the activation of the CH bond. The process is endothermic, requiring a significant amount of energy input. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures and with higher propylene selectivity. High-temperature stability, resistance to side reactions, and the ability to resist coke formation are crucial attributes for PDH catalysts. The literature discusses the use of zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, to enhance stability and improve propene selectivity. The role of exchanged metals like Ga and Zn in promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage is also highlighted. Additionally, the use of Pt-exchanged Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts is noted for their high stability in dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）用于工业丙烯生产的过程中，主要挑战是与CH键活化相关的热力学限制和动力学复杂性。该过程是吸热的，需要大量的能量输入。研究人员通过开发可以在较低温度下运行并具有更高丙烯选择性的催化剂来应对这些挑战。PDH催化剂的高温度稳定性、抵抗副反应的能力以及对焦炭形成的抵抗力是至关重要的属性。文献中讨论了使用沸石，如H-ZSM-5，以提高稳定性并改善丙烯选择性的作用。交换金属如镓和锌在促进从CH断裂形成H原子的再组合脱附中的作用也得到了强调。此外，使用Pt交换的Na-[Fe]ZSM-5催化剂被指出对于轻烷烃的脱氢具有出色的稳定性。

High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart [53] . The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate [57] . A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart.

When exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by zinc (Zn) or gallium (Ga) on H-ZSM-5, high alkene selectivities are achieved. The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 shows higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity compared to the Ga counterpart. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site occurs via a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, which involves conversion of the Lewis base site into a conjugate Bronsted acid site. On the other hand, the OGa+ site activates the CH bond through oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. The presence of a protonic site intermediate increases the likelihood of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 compared to the Ga counterpart.

当将可交换质子在H-ZSM-5上严格替换为锌（Zn）或镓（Ga）时，可以获得高烯烃选择性。Zn交换的H-ZSM-5显示出更高的乙烷转化率但更低的乙烯选择性，与Ga对应物相比。在OZn2+O位点上，CH激活通过亲核基团辅助去质子化机制发生，这涉及将亲核基团位点转化为共轭布伦斯特酸位点。另一方面，OGa+位点通过氧化加成激活CH键，而无需质子性位点中间体。存在质子性位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5上的副反应倾向，与Ga对应物相比。

Despite the high alkene selectivity rate obtained with Pt-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, the corresponding yield of alkenes is generally low due to an equilibrium constraint. Selective combustion of hydrogen will not only drive the equilibrium forward, it will also offset part of the energy input for the endothermic dehydrogenation. Selective hydrogen combustion and dehydrogenation can be accomplished with a single catalyst or a multi-catalyst system.

While Pt-based catalysts offer high alkene selectivity rates for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, the corresponding alkene yield is often low due to thermodynamic constraints. Selective hydrogen combustion can push the equilibrium forward and compensate for part of the energy input required for the endothermic dehydrogenation process. This can be achieved through the use of a single catalyst or a multi-catalyst system.

尽管基于铂的催化剂在非氧化脱氢下对轻烷烃的高烯烃选择性率，相应的烯烃产率通常较低，这是由于热力学限制。选择性氢燃烧可以推动平衡向前推进，并补偿端吸热脱氢过程所需的部分能量输入。这可以通过单个催化剂或多催化剂系统实现。
