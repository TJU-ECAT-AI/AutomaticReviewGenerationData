[1] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[2] "Commercial platinum catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnating the support material with a solution of platinum and tin precursors."

[3] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

[4] "Zeolites are ubiquitous materials in petroleum refining processes, and are used as catalysts, adsorbents, molecular sieves, etc."

[5] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."

[6] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."

[7] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."

[8] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."

[9] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al. [71] provides a lead in this respect. Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."

[10] "Although the ODH of alkanes over Ni-based catalysts has been explained using a parallel-consecutive reaction network and the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [169], there are indications that the Ni-center directly participates in the CH activation step."

Researchers are addressing the challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production by focusing on developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Challenges include achieving high selectivity for propylene production amidst competing reactions, maintaining catalyst stability at high temperatures, and minimizing side reactions that degrade product quality. Opportunities arise from advancements in materials science and catalysis research.

For high-temperature stability, researchers are exploring materials like ceria (CeO2) and metal-doped ceria, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen at typical PDH temperatures, reducing the need for external heating. For propylene selectivity, catalysts with optimized active sites, such as those found in zeolites and metal oxides, are being developed. Zeolites, in particular, offer a framework to incorporate exchangeable cations that can polarize alkane molecules and facilitate CH bond activation. Researchers are also leveraging metal doping to tailor the redox properties and surface chemistry of catalysts, enhancing propylene selectivity.

To address resistance to side reactions, catalyst design is focusing on reducing acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can promote unwanted reactions like cracking and aromatization. This is achieved through careful selection of support materials and cation exchange, as seen with the use of weaker basicity cations like boron (B) in borosilicate zeolites. Additionally, researchers are investigating the use of metal clusters and nanostructured catalysts to optimize the surface area and reduce the risk of coke formation.

Innovations in catalyst design, such as the use of porous copper-aluminum framework materials stabilized by metal oxides, promise improved performance for PDH. These materials offer better dispersion of active sites and potentially more efficient hydrogen removal, leading to higher propylene yields and selectivity. The use of advanced reactor configurations, like membrane reactors, is also being explored to enhance heat recovery and reduce the need for external energy inputs, further optimizing the PDH process.

By integrating insights from heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, researchers aim to develop catalysts that mimic the efficient CH bond activation mechanisms found in enzymes, leading to more effective and sustainable PDH processes. The use of computational methods to predict catalyst performance and guide material synthesis is becoming increasingly prevalent, accelerating the pace of innovation in this field.

研究人员正在通过开发具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和对副反应抵抗力的催化剂，同时考虑热力学限制，来解决丙烷脱氢（PDH）工业丙烯生产的挑战。挑战包括在竞争反应中实现高丙烯选择性生产，保持催化剂在高温下的稳定性，并减少可能降低产品质量的副反应。

为了提高高温稳定性，研究人员正在探索像氧化铈（CeO2）和金属氧化物这样的材料，它们可以在典型的PDH温度下选择性地氧化氢，从而减少对外部加热的需求。为了提高丙烯选择性，正在开发具有优化活性位点的催化剂，如在沸石和金属氧化物中的那些。沸石特别提供了框架来引入可交换的阳离子，这些阳离子可以极化烷烃分子并促进CH键活化。研究人员还利用金属掺杂来调整催化剂的还原性质和表面化学，增强丙烯选择性。

为了应对副反应的抵抗力，催化剂设计正在集中于减少催化剂表面上的酸位，这可以促进不希望的反应如裂解和芳构化。这是通过精心选择支持材料和离子交换来实现的，例如在硼硅酸盐沸石中使用较弱基本性的离子，如硼（B）。此外，研究人员正在研究金属簇和纳米结构催化剂的应用，以优化表面积并降低焦炭形成的风险。

创新的催化剂设计，如通过金属氧化物稳定化的多孔铜-铝框架材料，为PDH提供更好的性能承诺。这些材料提供了活性位点的更好分散，并可能更有效地去除氢气，从而提高丙烯产量和选择性。高级反应配置的使用，如膜反应器，也被探索以增强热量回收并减少对外部能量输入的需求，进一步优化PDH过程。

通过结合异相催化和均相催化的知识，研究人员旨在开发模仿酶中高效的CH键激活机制的催化剂，从而实现更有效和可持续的PDH流程。计算方法的使用来预测催化剂性能并指导材料合成正在变得越来越普遍，加速了这一领域的创新速度。
