<p>Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts.</p>
<p>The main challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by exploring catalysts with improved stability, such as Pt-based catalysts on zeolite supports, and catalysts with enhanced propene selectivity, like those containing redox-active additives or dopants. The use of zeolites as supports can improve catalyst stability and activity by creating a controlled environment for the reaction, minimizing side reactions, and facilitating the regeneration of catalysts.</p>

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the necessity for catalysts that are stable at high temperatures, possess high propylene selectivity, and are resistant to side reactions, all while considering the thermodynamic limitations of the process. Researchers are tackling these issues by developing catalysts with enhanced stability, such as platinum-based catalysts supported on zeolites, and catalysts with improved propene selectivity through the use of redox-active additives or dopants. Zeolites are being utilized as supports to improve catalyst stability and activity, facilitate reaction control, minimize side reactions, and enable catalyst regeneration.
