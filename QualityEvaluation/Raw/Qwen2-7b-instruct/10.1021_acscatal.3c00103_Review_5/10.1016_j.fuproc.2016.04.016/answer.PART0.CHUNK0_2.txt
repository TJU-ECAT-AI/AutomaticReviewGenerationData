[1] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."
[2] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity. This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated."
[3] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution. However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
[4] "The catalysts show excellent selectivity for hydrogen combustion, but they fall short of the stability criteria. The catalysts sinter during reduction because their melting points are below or near the dehydrogenation temperature."

Researchers are facing the challenge of developing PDH catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. The primary opportunities lie in the advancement of catalyst design, specifically in the use of zeolites, metal oxides, and halide-containing catalysts. Zeolites offer a well-defined structure that allows for the elucidation of structure-activity relationships, potentially leading to more efficient catalysts. Metal oxides like vanadium and niobium, when doped with lithium or halides, show promise in improving alkene selectivity. Halide-promoted catalysts, such as Li/MgO and CeO2/2CeF3, have been shown to enhance propene selectivity, although reaction temperatures tend to be higher. Researchers are also exploring the potential of creating active site mimics in solid frameworks to mimic enzyme-like properties for efficient CH activation and alkane dehydrogenation. This approach could address the thermodynamic limitations by achieving activation at milder conditions.

研究人员在开发用于工业丙烯生产的丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂时面临的主要挑战包括高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抵抗副反应的能力，同时考虑热力学限制。主要的机会在于催化剂设计的进步，特别是使用沸石、金属氧化物和含卤素催化剂。沸石因其结构明确而提供了解析结构-活性关系的可能性，这可能导致更高效的催化剂。例如，掺锂或含卤素的范德华和铌基氧化物显示出提高烯烃选择性的潜力。含卤素促进的催化剂，如Li/MgO和CeO2/2CeF3，已经证明可以增强丙烯选择性，尽管反应温度通常较高。研究人员还正在探索在固体框架中创建模仿酶性质的活性位点的可能性，以实现高效CH激活和烷烃脱氢。这种方法可能通过在温和条件下实现激活来解决热力学限制。
