<p>Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts.</p>
<p>The main challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:</p>
<p>1. High-temperature stability: Catalysts need to withstand high temperatures without deactivating prematurely.</p>
<p>2. Propylene selectivity: Achieving high propylene yield while minimizing side reactions and byproducts.</p>
<p>3. Resistance to side reactions: Reducing unwanted reactions that consume energy and lower product purity.</p>

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation for industrial propylene production involve ensuring high-temperature stability of the catalysts, maximizing propylene selectivity, and minimizing side reactions. The opportunities lie in developing innovative catalyst and process designs that optimize the energy-intensive dehydrogenation step alongside the exothermic hydrogen combustion, leading to more efficient and selective propylene production.
