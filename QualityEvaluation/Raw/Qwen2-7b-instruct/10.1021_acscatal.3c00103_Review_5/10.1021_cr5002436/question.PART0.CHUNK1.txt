4.3 Vanadium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives. Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides. (199, 200) The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201) Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant. Therefore, a combination of VO-support, VOV, or VO moieties may be obtained, each having different catalytic activity. In addition, depending on the support, mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or Mg may be formed.
The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings. On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation. A schematic display of these vanadium species is shown in Figure 21. (202) Figure 21 Figure 21. Various vanadium oxide species present on a catalyst support (S): isolated vanadium oxide species (a), dimers (b), two-dimensional chains of vanadium oxide species (c), and V2O5 crystallites (d).

Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, (203-206) the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH. Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation. On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation. (30, 206) Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. (207-209) The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Harlin et al. studied the effects of vanadium oxide reduction with H2, CO, and CH4 prior to the dehydrogenation reaction. In all cases, the reduction was incomplete, and yielded a mix of vanadium oxide species, including V3+, V4+, and V5+ (see Figure 22). Higher initial catalytic activities were obtained in all cases, although the effect was strongest after reduction with CO. The authors suggested that when the catalyst was reduced with H2 and CH4, detrimental OH groups were formed. V4+ was determined to be the most active species in butane dehydrogenation.

Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active. (206) V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C. (210) In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. (211-213) Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction. Ogonowski et al. reported that the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. Relatively weak basic sites on carriers, such as those present on an activated carbon support, facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. When these basic sites are too strong, as is the case on Al2O3 and ZnO2, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites. This increases the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity. If these basic sites are absent, as in the case of SiO2, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed.
Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity. (214) Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation. (208) An overview of the different VOx catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is shown in Table 5.

4.4 Molybdenum Oxide-Based Catalysts
Molybdenum oxides are also frequently used as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. To our knowledge, the first report of the dehydrogenation activity of a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst was of MoO3/Al2O3 in the dehydrocyclization of n-heptane, which was published in 1946. (216) Since that first report, the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes on MoOx has been studied scarcely, as emphasis has been given to the study of oxidative dehydrogenation on these materials.
The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions. (217) Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species. (218) These reduced sites are believed to be Mo4+ and Mo5+. Further reduction results in sites that are more active, but the latter catalyze cracking and deactivate fast due to coke deposition. In fact, at loadings above monolayer coverage, the catalyst is more easily reduced, which results in a drop in catalyst activity. (218, 219) The same authors also point out that such a catalyst deactivates due to the formation of catalytically inactive Al2(MoO4)3 crystallites. To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenummagnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition. The reduction of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites. (220) Overall, MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity.
Figure 23 Figure 23. Yield of different carbon molecules during butane dehydrogenation on a MoOxCy catalyst at different steam partial pressures. When no steam is added, the selectivity to C4 alkenes drops rapidly and the methane yield reaches 100% after 5 h. The hydrogenolysis reaction is suppressed when steam is added to the feed. Reprinted from ref 221, copyright 1999, with permission from Elsevier.
The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide. These materials are also active in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, and a high activity close to the thermodynamic equilibrium is initially obtained, although over a period of a few hours the selectivity drops to zero and the reaction yields only methane, as shown in Figure 23. During this period, the oxycarbide becomes depleted from oxygen and a wide range of carbides active in hydrogenolysis are formed. (222) To improve the stability of the oxide, steam can be added to the feed (which hampers the growth of these carbides) or the catalyst can be doped with vanadium (which increases the oxophilicity of the catalyst). X-ray diffractograms showing this transition are shown in Figure 24. However, the introduction of steam is not free of drawbacks, as it induces sintering. Hydrogen addition prevents coke formation and increases conversion, albeit it is believed that H2 competitively adsorbs on the active sites of the catalyst. (221-223) Figure 24 Figure 24. XRD diffractograms of the fresh Mo oxycarbide catalyst before dehydrogenation, but after pretreatment (top left), as well as after dehydrogenation reaction with no steam (top right), with 5 Torr of steam (bottom left), and with 18 Torr of steam (bottom right). In the absence of steam, the well-defined MoO2 and MoOxCy species disappear during reaction and are replaced by more amorphous MoOxCy species, which are enriched with carbon and presumably responsible for hydrogenolysis. The addition of steam prevents this transformation and with 18 Torr of steam, MoO2 and ordered MoOxCy species are still observed on the spent catalysts. Reprinted from ref 221, copyright 1999, with permission from Elsevier.
Consistent with the fact that MoOxCy is a catalyst active in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. showed that MoO3 deposited on SiC displays significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed. (224) As compared to bulk MoO3 and MoO3 supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, higher selectivities and stability are obtained over MoO3/SiC, albeit at the cost of a lower conversion. This was explained by the increased reducibility of MoO3/SiC as compared to the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst. A summary of the Mo-based catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is shown in Table 6.

4.5 Gallium Oxide-Based Catalysts
The dehydrogenation activity of gallium oxide supported on ZSM-5, which was first reported in the late 1980s in studies dealing with conversion of propane to aromatics, has been the target of renewed attention in recent years. (225-228) In the interim, both bulk and supported Ga2O3 have been used as dehydrogenation catalysts.
The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors. (229) β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity. (230) Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed. (33, 231) The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., (232) who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity (see Figure 25). Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst. (233, 234) In addition, Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity. (235) Figure 25 Figure 25. Concentration of Lewis acid sites versus propane conversion measured 15 min after the start of the PDH reaction on GaxAl10xO15. A clear correlation between the conversion and the surface density of weak Lewis acid sites is observed. For these experiments, CO2 is used to improve conversion.

Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3. Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group. A second hydroxyl group is formed via β-hydrogen elimination, but for these hydroxyl groups to recombine, either as H2O or as H2, a high energy barrier needs to be overcome. This barrier is much lower over a gallium hydridehydroxide species, although the formation of the gallium hydride also involves a high energy barrier. Nevertheless, theoretical calculations by Pidko et al. indicate that these relatively stable [HGaOH]+ sites are preferentially regenerated by water desorption resulting in a reduced active site. (236) Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst. (237, 238) Contradictory information has been reported regarding the reducibility of Ga2O3. Rodriguez et al. reported that Ga2O3/Al2O3 is not reduced by hydrogen at 700 C, but the presence of Pd on the catalyst can assist the reduction of Ga3+ to Ga+ and Ga0 at temperatures between 300 and 550 C and form an alloy (in which Ga0 is immobilized). Indeed, it has been reported that the reduction of Ga2O3 can be promoted by the proximity of other, more easily reduced metals, such as Pt and Pd. (131-133, 238) For instance, on a PtGa/H-beta catalyst, reduced gallium hydrides were observed after hydrogen reduction at 550 C. (239) It has also been proposed that the reducibility of these species depends on the interaction of gallium oxide with the catalyst support, which is also the case with CrOx (vide supra), where a weak metalsupport interaction results in an increased reducibility. Indeed, Meitzner et al. showed that Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 could be reduced by hydrogen or hydrocarbons at dehydrogenation reaction conditions. Finally, regarding the reduction of Ga2O3, it is important to note that Ga2O is gaseous and metallic gallium is liquid at dehydrogenation reaction conditions. (240) A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield. (241-245) Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption. (241, 242) However, other authors claimed that the increase in activity was caused by the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). (243, 244) Additionally, Michorczyk et al. noted that this effect could only be seen at relative low levels of coke deposition. (235) It was suggested that CO2 could also poison the basic sites required for the dissociative adsorption of the alkane. Additionally, Hensen et al. studied the promoting effect of water with experiments and theory and observed an increase in the conversion of propane by cofeeding water. (246) The authors attributed this promoting effect to the formation of partially hydrolyzed gallium species, more specifically, to the formation of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga3+ cations.
Different carriers have been used in gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts, the inclusion of acid and basic sites on the support being important to achieve a high conversion. Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation. (233) The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface. However, a different trend was observed when CO2 was present, as conversion was observed to be high on Ga2O3/TiO2 and low on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. This was attributed to the two contrary roles of CO2, which on the one hand removes H2 from the surface of the catalyst by the reverse watergas shift reaction, while on the other hand absorbs strongly on the basic sites of the support. Thus, the low conversion observed when zirconia or alumina were employed as the support can be ascribed to the relatively high amount of basic sites on these oxides. Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking. (245) Work on the promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts appears to be limited, although a patent by Iezzi et al. claims that a catalyst comprising 1.2 wt % Ga2O3, <99 ppm of Pt, and 1.6 wt % of SiO2 on an Al2O3 support represents a highly active formulation in the dehydrogenation reaction. (247) Indeed, when this catalyst is used for PDH, a conversion of 39% and a selectivity of 85% can be obtained after 150 h of time-on-stream at 580 C, with frequent regenerations at 650 C. These values are the highest among those reported for Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts. However, which metal, Pt or Ga, is predominately responsible for the high activity of this catalyst, is not discussed.In recent work by Sattler et al., a 3 wt % Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted with 1000 ppm of Pt and 0.25 wt % of K to obtain a highly active, selective, and stable PDH catalyst. (248) Evidently, the function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. However, Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%. In the absence of Pt, propane conversion is more than halved. It was suggested that the role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species. The catalytic data on the Ga-based formulations discussed above are summarized in Table 7.Table 7.

4.6 Carbon-Based Catalysts
Carbon materials have been tested as the support in catalysts employed for various reactions, mostly because of their high surface area and the fact that these materials are both inexpensive and environmentally friendly. Moreover, discrete functionalities of activated carbon can catalyze an array of reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation. (250) McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation. (215) The fact that catalytic activity remained the same despite complete coke encapsulation is remarkable, as this extent of coking usually results in a drastic decrease in activity. The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure. In view of this, the authors decided to test their hypothesis by using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a catalyst under similar conditions. Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high. However, elevated temperatures also lead to a drop in selectivity, as cracking becomes the dominant reaction. Interestingly, the latter was not the case in the work of McGregor et al., who reported a selectivity toward butenes of 80%. Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material. (251) Figure 26 Figure 26. TEM images of VOx/Al2O3 after butane dehydrogenation at 550 C (left) and 700 C (center and right). The high magnification image of the catalyst deactivated at 700 C clearly shows that the catalyst is completely enveloped in a carbon layer a few nanometers thick. Nevertheless, this catalyst still displays a relatively high activity at 700 C. Reprinted from ref 215, copyright 2010, with permission from Elsevier.
In previous work, CNFs had been shown to be active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane, although in this case surface oxygen groups were believed to be the active sites. (252) Furthermore, nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) showed some activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, although conversion and selectivity were relatively low. (253) Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. (254) The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid. The catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability, displaying conversion and selectivity values of 45% and 85%, respectively, after 100 h of time on stream at 600 C. Experiments in which carbon nanotubes were tested under similar conditions resulted in low activity.
Neylon et al. studied the activity of supported early transition metal (groups 5 and 6) nitrides and carbides in butane dehydrogenation, (255, 256) as the catalytic properties of these materials are believed to be similar to those of platinum. Interestingly, Mo, V, and W carbides and nitrides showed activity in both dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, displaying specific activities similar to those of a commercial PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Niobium carbide and nitride did not show any activity. The group 6 compounds tested were found to be more active, albeit they primarily catalyzed hydrogenolysis. In Table 8 are shown the catalytic data of the carbon-based dehydrogenation catalysts as reported by McGregor et al. and Liu et al.
In addition, silica supported metal sulfides, such as ZnS, FeS, CuS, CoS, MnS, NiS, and MoS, were tested for the dehydrogenation of isobutane, and were found to perform significantly better than their respective oxides. The materials show higher initial yields than commercial CrOx and PtSn catalyst, but they deactivate over a few hours due to sulfur leaching. (257) Table 8.

4.7 Other Formulations
Indium is known to share many of the catalytic properties of gallium, a prominent example being the activity that both metals display in NOx reduction. (258) These similarities are relatively unsurprising, particularly taking into account the adjacency of Ga and In within the same group of the periodic table. Interestingly, Halasz et al. have tested the reactivity of propane on Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 and found both catalysts to be active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values. (259) However, both Ga/ZSM-5 and In/ZSM-5 did not exclusively yield propylene, but also larger aromatic molecules. Whereas dehydrogenation and aromatization activity were found to be associated with Lewis acidity, cracking and coke formation were related to Brnsted acidity.
Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. (260) A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27. Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation. The reduction of these particles is a slow process during reaction, and thus a considerable amount of time is required to attain the optimal yields. By prereducing the catalyst with hydrogen, high conversions were immediately obtained. Similar conclusions were reached in a study involving a series of oxide-supported In2O3-based catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. (261) Al2O3 and ZrO2 were more suitable supports than SiO2, as the interaction of the indium oxide was stronger with the former carriers, resulting in a better distribution of small nanoparticles.
CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation.
Figure 27 Figure 27. Propane conversion on a series of 20% In80% metal mixed oxides showing InAlOx to be the most active formulation (left). Albeit other In:Al ratios were tested, 20% In80% Al afforded the highest propylene yield. The TPR profiles of different InAl mixed oxides after H2 reduction at 500 C and subsequent treatment with CO2 at 600 C are also shown (right). The peak at around 700 C (labeled β) represents the reduction of In2O3 to In0; the total hydrogen consumption showing the In2O3 is nearly completely reduced to In0. The peak at 300 C (labeled α) corresponds to the reduction of small In2O3 domains in the mixed oxide and suggests the formation of small metallic In particles. The absence of this peak in the top trace suggests that CO2 cannot reoxidize these particles at 600 C. The graph to the left is reprinted from ref 260, copyright 2010, with permission from Elsevier.

Albeit supported iron oxides have been known to be active in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation since 1946, (264) it was not until the 1990s that Geus and co-workers investigated the activity of supported iron oxide in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene to 13 butadiene. (265-268) The authors determined that Fe3+ is the catalytically active species. The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction. On the other hand, the acidic groups responsible for coke formation are poisoned by potassium ions. Optimal stability was obtained with a FeOx monolayer, regardless of the type of support employed. An interesting sulfate-promoted FeOx/Al2O3 catalytic system was reported by Sun et al., which showed excellent activity in propane dehydrogenation, accompanied by relatively high stability. (269) The sulfate groups were found to withdraw electrons from Fe, enhancing the acidity of Fe sites and improving activity. Unfortunately, the sulfate groups were not completely stable, and the loss of sulfate groups as SO2 resulted in the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst by carburization and sintering.
In a recent publication by Yun et al., an active propane dehydrogenation catalyst was obtained by incorporating Fe ions in the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites. The catalytic activity was explained by the redox properties of these sites (Fe2+ and Fe3+ redox cycle) that resulted in the formation of radical intermediates. (270) Shimada et al. investigated the use of activated carbon, promoted by Fe, as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. (250) In the absence of iron, activated carbon was only able to afford an isobutene yield of 10%, albeit this value increased to 40% upon the addition of 3.5 wt % Fe3O4 in the presence of CO2. In addition to dehydrogenation, the iron oxide also catalyzes the RWGS reaction. Indeed, XRD results show that the iron oxide is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed, and subsequently reoxidized by the CO2 in the feed.
The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics on Zn supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has received considerable attention. (100, 271-275) Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation were deemed to be the active sites, with a reaction mechanism similar to that reported on GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. (276-280) These species resided in the cation exchange sites of the zeolite, effectively providing the counter-charge for two Al species. The proximity of Al species was found to be important, as calculations show basic Al-bound oxygen is required to perform the CH cleavage and form an AlOH group. This is important, as, similar to Ga, ZnH and ZnOH groups are difficult to regenerate. Furthermore, these species were found to be highly stable, which is important as volatile Zn species may be formed at dehydrogenation reaction conditions.
The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has also been studied, the catalysts being prepared either as hydrogels or as mixed oxides. Chen et al. investigated mixed oxides with different zinc to titanium ratios and found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 resulted in the most active catalyst. Cubic Zn2TiO3 was deemed to be the active species in dehydrogenation, although the overall activity of these catalysts was found to be limited. (281-283) More recently, isolated Zn2+ species deposited on a silica support were found to be active in propane dehydrogenation. (284) The active sites were determined to be coordinatively unsaturated Zn2+ Lewis acids sites located on a tri-membered siloxane ring on the silica support. During the catalytic reaction, the Zn is transformed to tricoordinated species due to the temperature increase. DFT calculations suggested a reaction mechanism akin to that observed over CrOx and GaOx catalysts.
In Table 9 are shown the catalytic activity data of the indium- and iron-based dehydrogenation catalysts discussed.

5.1 In Terms of Reaction Mechanism and Deactivation Pathway
Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides. The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. (285) This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag. (286) Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290) Several studies have been performed on Pt and PtSn catalysts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction. First, isotopic labeling experiments have been used to identify the reaction intermediates. For example, cofeeding D2 during ethane dehydrogenation resulted in a single deuterium being attached to the ethane molecules, suggesting an ethyl reaction intermediate. (291) However, because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results.
Scheme 2 Scheme 2. Dehydrogenation Mechanism As Proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi on a Pt Surfacea Scheme aThe intermediates depicted have been observed by IR spectroscopy during the hydrogenation reaction at low temperatures and are supported by theoretical calculations. The dissociative adsorption of propane may also take place by the abstraction of the β-hydrogen, forming a 2-propyl intermediate, but for brevity this pathway is not shown. High paraffin pressures favor the formation of propylidyne species (step h-j), which are coke precursors. These species are relatively stable and can only be hydrogenated when high concentrations of hydrogen are present on the Pt surface. (292-297) Infrared spectroscopy is another valuable tool to detect intermediates formed during dehydrogenation reactions on Pt-based catalysts. Because of experimental limitations, this is done through the study of the reverse hydrogenation reaction, which takes places at considerably lower temperatures. This approach assumes that the same reaction intermediates are encountered, which needs to be verified due to the significantly different reaction conditions. During the adsorption of ethylene on both Pt and PtSn surfaces at temperatures ranging from 100 to 27 C, several species are detected, including ethylidyne as well as π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene (the propylene analogues of which are shown in Scheme 2). (116, 117, 298-300) Cremer et al. used sum frequency generation IR to elucidate the role of these ethylene adspecies on a Pt (111) surface. (301, 302) During ethylene hydrogenation, ethylidyne was found to be a spectator species, although one competing for active sites on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, π-bonded ethylene was determined to be the main intermediate of ethylene hydrogenation, although di-σ-bonded ethylene was also converted at a lower rate. Ethyl groups are only detected at very high hydrogen pressures, as these species readily convert to di-σ-ethylene otherwise. Nevertheless, Zaera et al. have reported that the reaction mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation involves a π-bonded ethylene and an ethyl intermediate. (303) Furthermore, when propylene adsorption on Pt (111) was studied by reflectionabsorption IR spectroscopy, most of the propylene was found to be coordinated as di-σ-bonded, albeit π-bonded propylene was found to predominate at high surface coverages. (292) On the contrary, DFT calculations showed that propylene is preferentially adsorbed in the disigma mode. (75, 114) DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step. In the presence of Sn, this energy barrier is increased, as is shown in Figure 28, therefore decreasing the activity of the catalyst. (114, 118) On Pt (111) the dehydrogenation may proceed by a 1- or a 2-propyl intermediate, while on the PtSn alloys the 1-propyl intermediate is favored. The positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene.
Figure 28 Figure 28. Energy profiles for propane dehydrogenation to propylene on Pt (111) (black), Pt3Sn (111) (blue), and Pt2Sn (111) (red) surfaces, as obtained by DFT calculations. The intermediates are shown along with their corresponding energies. The recombination of the hydrogen adatoms is not considered. (114) The values of potential energy for all intermediates are given relative to the potential energy of a propane molecule in the gas phase and a clean catalyst surface.
Microcalorimetry has afforded complementary information on the dehydrogenation mechanism over Pt-based catalysts, a lower heat of adsorption of ethylene being detected on the PtSn relative to the Pt surface (94135 and 157 kJ mol1, respectively). (117, 296) These relatively high heat of adsorption values are generally indicative of the dissociative adsorption of a hydrocarbon. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the adsorption of ethane on different Pt and PtSn alloy surfaces, (111) and (211), have revealed that electron transfer takes place from Sn to Pt. Keeping in mind the fact that Sn addition reduces the heat of adsorption, the formation of ethylidyne becomes energetically less favorable because of this electron transfer. (117, 118, 289, 304) In addition, by studying these different PtSn alloys, it was shown that the presence of Sn reduces the amount of highly active Pt step sites, on which reaction intermediates adsorb strongly. (304) The latter observation is rendered particularly noteworthy by the fact that isotopic labeling experiments, performed by Galvita et al. during ethane dehydrogenation, have revealed that ethylene can form methane and coke through cracking, the conversion proceeding via an ethylidyne intermediate. (132, 290) The dehydrogenation mechanism on chromia-based catalysts is somewhat different, as both the chromium and the oxygen atoms of the oxide are believed to participate in the reaction. (305) Quantum chemical methods (DFT) have been used by Lillehaug et al. to study the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on a series of clusters containing a single Cr3+ ion bonded to OH or OSi groups species, which served as a model for the different active sites suggested in literature. (306, 307) The first step they proposed is CH activation via σ-bond metathesis resulting in the formation of CrC and OH bonds, followed by a β-H transfer to a Cr site. (306, 308) The final step proposed is the formation of hydrogen and the desorption of the latter and ethylene. An alternative mechanism, in which a CrH species activates ethane by forming molecular hydrogen and an adsorbed ethyl species, has been proposed on the basis of the results of isotopic labeling experiments performed during ethane dehydrogenation on a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. (144) The two main mechanisms proposed for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes on chromia/alumina catalysts are shown in Scheme 3. In these mechanisms, either the dissociative adsorption (144, 305) or β-H elimination is believed to be the rate-limiting step. (306, 309, 310) Figure 29 shows two reaction cycles in an energy diagram, as calculated by Lillehaug et al. Indeed, the energy barrier is the highest for the initial CH activation, although this energy is significantly lower when the bond is activated by the CrH intermediate (i.e., the right part of Scheme 3). Nevertheless, hydrogen desorption is preferred, as the energy barrier is lower.
In situ FTIR spectroscopy has provided evidence of the formation of acetaldehyde and acetone intermediates as ethane and propane are adsorbed on a mesoporous chromiaalumina catalyst. (197) Furthermore, during the dehydrogenation of propane on a CrOx catalyst, surface species including aliphatic, unsaturated, and aromatic carbon species, along with acetates and carboxylates, have been detected by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). (192, 197, 311) This is consistent with a model in which the first step of the reaction is the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane to form an alkoxide species (ethoxide and isopropoxide being formed from ethane and propane, respectively). However, the reduction of the catalyst prior to the dehydrogenation reaction led to a dramatic decrease in the amounts of acetates and carboxylates detected, albeit the reaction rate remained unaffected. Evidently, the latter throws into question the role of acetic and carboxylic species as reaction intermediates. An alternative interpretation is that these species are formed during the reduction of the Cr6+ species by hydrocarbons present in the feed. Parenthetically, the involvement of hydrocarbons in the formation of reduced active chromium sites, the participation of both chromium and oxygen atoms in the reaction, and the proposition that CH activation represents the first reaction step are somewhat reminiscent of the Phillips catalyst and of the mechanism of ethylene polymerization recently proposed by Copret and co-workers over this formulation. (312, 313) However, additional work will be necessary to investigate the relationship between the mechanisms of ethylene polymerization and ethane dehydrogenation, particularly in view of the different nature of the reactions and the reaction conditions.
Scheme 3 Scheme 3. Proposed Reaction Mechanisms for the Dehydrogenation of Ethane on CrOx Catalysts (144, 306, 307) Figure 29 Figure 29. Energy profile for propane dehydrogenation to propylene on CrOx catalyst obtained by DFT calculations. The intermediates from Scheme 3 are shown along with their relative energies. Note that for the second section of the scheme, a second propane molecule is dehydrogenated. (314, 315) The values of potential energy for all intermediates are given relative to the potential energy of a propane molecule in the gas phase and a clean catalyst surface.
The reaction mechanism on GaOx has been studied by Liu et al. by DFT calculations on a Ga (100) surface (Figure 30). (231) A mechanism similar to that shown in Scheme 3 was proposed, except for the fact that the initial CH activation takes place involving a radical, which can adsorb on the Ga site as an ethyl species, or directly undergo the second CH cleavage step. The desorption of both hydrogen and propylene was found to be energetically unfavorable, which was used to explain the rapid coking and the relative low activity of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Indeed, while heating Ga2O3 in an ethane atmosphere, the evolution of Ga-ethyl and hydroxyl surface species was observed by DRIFTS at 150 C. (316) Figure 30 Figure 30. Energy profile for propane dehydrogenation to propylene on GaOx catalyst, as determined by DFT calculations on a Ga (100) surface. Intermediates analogous to those displayed in Scheme 3 are shown along with their relative energies. Note that two pathways for the dehydrogenation of propane are considered, one involving a radical intermediate and another an ethyl intermediate, the former having a lower energy barrier. (314, 315) The values of potential energy for all intermediates are given relative to the potential energy of a propane molecule in the gas phase and a clean catalyst surface.
To summarize, most of the experimental results suggest that the dehydrogenation of light alkanes proceeds via the HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, where either the dissociative adsorption of the alkane or the second CH bond cleavage is the rate-determining step. Evidence of fundamental differences in the reaction mechanism on metal oxide and noble metal catalysts is lacking, although reports of mechanistic studies involving metal oxide catalysts are admittedly scant.
All dehydrogenation catalysts deactivate with time-on-stream, several processes being responsible for the deactivation of the different types of catalysts discussed in this Review. However, there has been a clear consensus in the literature since the mid-1970s identifying coke deposition as the main cause of deactivation. (77, 317-319) Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity. Therefore, the detrimental effect of coke is largely dependent on catalyst design and the location of the coke deposits. (320) The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Brnsted acid and others active sites of the catalysts serve as seeding points to which olefins and paraffins are added until large graphitic structures are formed. Indeed, olefins in the stream can easily react with the carbocation intermediates formed on these acid sites. Additionally, strong adsorption of reaction intermediates, such as the ethylidyne or ethyne species discussed above, (75, 132, 290) and/or products on active sites can also induce polymerization and lead to the formation of graphitic sheets. In Scheme 4, several pathways for the formation of the first aromatic ring structures from propylidyne and similar molecules are proposed, which include cracking, deep dehydrogenation, and polymerization reactions.
Scheme 4 Scheme 4. Proposed Pathway Linking the Formation of Strongly Adsorbed Propyl Species to That of an Aromatic Ring through a Series of Cracking (ae), Deep Dehydrogenation (fi), and/or Dimerization (f,g,j,k) Reactions (293, 294, 321)a Scheme aNote that the adsorbed hydrocarbons shown in the scheme are examples of species formed on the Pt surface, and that they actually represent a family of similar species.
Scheme 5 Scheme 5. Proposed Mechanisms for the Growth of Polyaromatic Species by Either DielsAlder-type Addition, Propylene Addition via Radical Chemistry, or Fusion of Small Domains into Larger Ones (322, 323)a Scheme aThe species will continue to grow in a similar fashion, and at a certain point are considered to be graphene-like sheets. The molecules in the scheme are only simplified hydrogen-deficient coke precursors that may be present on the surface of the catalyst. Such species are directly bonded to the Pt surface and in reality will contain significant amounts of hydrogen, either in hydrogen-terminated aromatic rings or in aliphatic side chains.
Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains, as shown in Scheme 5. When these polyaromatic species are still relatively small, they can also migrate from the metal to the support (where they can undergo further oligomerization and condensation). In fact, the addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal. (304, 324, 325) In addition, acid sites present on the support may protonate these small polyaromatics, making them more reactive toward gas-phase olefins. (322, 326) Nevertheless, studies on these processes are scant, which is why the mechanism explaining the progression from adsorbed atomic carbon to aromatic rings is still largely unknown. Therefore, more detailed studies are needed to better understand this process. For example, it would be beneficial to gain a fundamental understanding on the steps proposed in Schemes 4 and 5 to develop strategies to prevent coke formation through these routes.
The location of coke is very important, as coke on the support has a milder negative effect on catalyst activity. (320, 324) However, it is important to note that the presence of carbon deposits on the surface does not always negatively influence catalyst performance. Indeed, a low amount of coke deposition has been observed to increase the catalytic activity by facilitating the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site. (320) Furthermore, highly active sites responsible for side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, are the first to be poisoned by coke, resulting in higher selectivity to the olefin product. Coke becomes detrimental when large graphitic sheets are formed that cover the catalytically active sites. (173, 180) To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures. The ambivalent nature of coke deposits is further highlighted by the fact that their presence on deactivated catalysts is essential in the industrial processes that use coke combustion as the main source of the heat required to run the dehydrogenation reaction.
Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, (324, 327, 328) whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition. Even the nature of the alkane reactant has an effect, as coke formed during propane dehydrogenation on a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is reported to be more detrimental than coke formed during ethane dehydrogenation (although such a comparison is difficult because these reactions run at different temperatures). (132) Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example.
5.2 In Terms of Propane and Isobutane Dehydrogenation Performance
Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations. We have attempted this comparison focusing on three performance criteria, olefin yield (obtained at the start of the experiment), stability (expressed as the deactivation rate), and the space velocity at which the first two criteria were measured (expressed as WHSV). In this approach, the effects of various factors, such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support, are not considered. The reasons to ignore these effects include the fact that this information is missing in many articles (pressure being a notable example), the absence of a clear trend (as tends to be the case with temperature), and an excessively large variance within a single variable to allow a meaningful comparison (catalyst preparation being an instance of such a variable). It is important to note that catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source. Also of note is the fact that the performance criteria compared were measured during propane or isobutane dehydrogenation, which are the reactions that have been researched most intensively.
Figure 31 Figure 31. Propylene yield during propane dehydrogenation (left) and isobutene yield during isobutane dehydrogenation (right) versus the deactivation rate of catalysts included in Tables 39. Each data point is labeled with the number included in the first column of the relevant table, to distinguish between different catalysts. Catalyst systems displaying high yields combined with low deactivation rates are preferred.
In Figure 31, the yields of propylene and isobutene are plotted versus the deactivation rate of Pt-, CrOx-, GaOx-, and In2O3-based catalysts. Moreover, in the plot showing PDH results, the data points representing the catalytic performance of different catalyst types are grouped around similar values, the best initial yields being similar for Pt and CrOx and slightly higher for GaOx. Additionally, PDH results show that the different catalyst types deactivate at different speeds, with Pt being particularly stable, CrOx deactivating rapidly, and other systems deactivating even faster. Another interesting observation stemming from the PDH data is that within each type of catalyst high yields often coincide with relatively low deactivation rates, which is counterintuitive. Although considerably fewer data points are available for the isobutane dehydrogenation, the Pt-based catalysts also display a superior stability as compared to the metal oxides at similar yields. Notably, the VOx-based catalysts show excellent yields (40%), albeit they deactivate very fast.
Space velocity is another important factor that has been considered to compare the performance of different dehydrogenation catalysts. In Figure 32 are plotted propylene and isobutene yield aagainst the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).
Figure 32 Figure 32. Yield of propylene and isobutene versus WHSV (left and right, respectively) of the catalysts included in Tables 39. High yields obtained at high space velocities are preferred. Therefore, because Pt-based catalysts can afford comparable yields to catalysts based on metal oxides while operating at higher space velocities, they are deemed superior in this respect.To be commercially attractive, dehydrogenation catalysts must provide high olefin yields at high space velocities. In other words, catalysts should display high specific activity, which is to say good conversion at short contact times. Figure 32 illustrates that while the yields obtained over GaOx-, CrOx-, and Pt-based propane dehydrogenation catalysts are comparable, GaOx-, CrOx-, and Pt-based catalysts operate at relatively low, intermediate, and high space velocities, respectively.Taking into account that Pt-based catalysts typically have low loadings (<1 wt %), whereas GaOx- and CrOx-based catalysts generally have loadings between 5 and 20 wt %, it is clear that on a weight basis Pt represents the most active formulation in PDH. This is confirmed when the average specific activities from Tables 39 are compared to one another. Indeed, for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt-based catalysts, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively. In Scheme 6, the proposed active sites for propane dehydrogenation of these three catalysts are shown. In the case of platinum-based catalysts, any Pt0 atom located at the surface is believed to catalyze the reaction, while in CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts Cr3+ and Ga3+ must be coordinatively unsaturated to display catalytic activity. This similarity between the active sites of Ga- and Cr-containing catalyst, and their difference to Pt, may therefore explain the relative specific activity values of these formulations.However, it should be noted that specific activity values are a very rough approximation of the real TOF of these catalysts. In case of Pt catalysts, all Pt (not only the surface Pt) is taken into account in our specific activity calculation, and additional errors are introduced for the metal oxides. In the case of CrOx catalysts, only coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are active in the dehydrogenation reaction, yet our specific activity calculations take into account a considerable amount of species that are either coordinatively saturated or in a different oxidation state. Although Ga3+ is likely the only stable species during the dehydrogenation reaction, our specific activity calculation involving GaOx catalysts considers a significant amount of the Ga that is either present in the framework of the support or incorporated in larger Ga2O3 crystallites. Nevertheless, the difference between the specific activity calculated for Pt and the metal oxides is in the range of 4 orders of magnitude, which cannot be explained solely by the errors introduced in our calculations. For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the same differences of specific activities between the Pt and metal oxide catalysts are observed.It is important to mention that catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used. Notably, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations, despite the fact that the latter are commonly used at higher space velocities, which highlights the remarkable stability of Pt catalysts.The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4. In these calculations, the energy barrier for the rate limiting step on PtSn system is lower (109 kJ mol1) than in the CrOx and GaOx catalysts (161 and 163 kJ mol1, respectively). Ea affects the reaction rate, as described by the Arrhenius equation:where k is the reaction rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. By calculating k/A at a temperature of 600 C and assuming A is comparable for the three systems considered, the rate constant is 103 times higher for the PtSn catalysts as compared to the metal oxide catalysts. The difference in the calculated specific activity values for propane dehydrogenation on the Pt and metal oxide catalysts (Tables 3, 4, and 7) is approximately 104, as is shown in Scheme 6. The higher activity observed for the Pt-based catalysts may therefore be explained by the significantly lower energy barrier of the rate-limiting step. However, care must be taken when comparing these Ea values, as the methods used for obtaining these are not identical. Furthermore, these simulations assume model surfaces that do not resemble real catalyst systems, and therefore the results are not necessarily representative of the experimentally observed reaction rates. Nevertheless, these combined theoretical and experimental data are very encouraging and highlight the need for more extensive studies on the reaction rate on Pt- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts.To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts.Scheme 6 Scheme 6. Proposed Active Sites for the Pt-, CrOx-, and GaOx-Based Propane Dehydrogenation Catalysts, the Order of Magnitude of Their Calculated Specific Activity, and the Reaction Rates (k/A) Calculated by DFT 6 Conclusions and Emerging Areas of Research Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years. Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures.Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues.Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved. O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1)). Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity. (252, 329, 330) CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture. However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2. Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance. (162, 175, 331) In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins.An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction. (332-334) Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion. (335, 336) Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen. Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application.Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product. (337-344) A large variety of membranes have been investigated, such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and membranes involving either molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves. The inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, as both qualities are desired. Catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops. Nevertheless, nearly all studies report increased olefin yields when a membrane system is used.It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings. Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled. Currently, this is done in a very crude manner, by monitoring the gas composition at the reactor outlet. However, recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control. (198) Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface. (173, 180, 345, 346) As is shown in Figure 33, spatiotemporal differences in the coke deposition on a catalyst bed consisting of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates were visualized in a pilot scale reactor using two UVvis probes, which collected spectra in a continuous fashion during propane dehydrogenation. (198) Coke deposition was observed to occur faster at the top of the catalyst bed, which was attributed to the temperature gradient measured in the reactor. Furthermore, coke combustion proceeded in an inhomogeneous fashion, coke at the top of the catalyst bed being combusted first.Figure 33 Figure 33. To the left, a schematic representation of the pilot-scale reactor used for propane dehydrogenation is shown. Two UVvis probes are inserted in the reactor to visualize the deactivation of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst as a function of time and catalyst bed height (the spectra acquired are shown in the center of the figure). This technique is excellent to visualize the coke-induced darkening of the catalyst extrudates from green to black, as is shown in the photographs to the right. Reproduced from ref 198, copyright 2013, by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry.These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state, as moderate amounts of coke are believed to assist the dehydrogenation reaction while excessive amounts lead to catalyst deactivation (vide supra). The latter would undoubtedly represent an improvement to the way in which reversible deactivation is currently addressed. As an additional advantage, UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor the long-term irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Indeed, because the relative amounts of active chromia and of chromium that has become irreversibly deactivated due to its migration into the support can be measured by UVvis spectroscopy, this technique provides a means to determine when the catalyst needs replacing.This analysis has been taken a step further by designing, constructing, and testing probes for operando Raman spectroscopy, which were used to obtain information on the chemical nature of the coke deposits formed during reaction. Furthermore, by using the operando UVvis spectra as a measure for catalyst darkening, a quantitative analysis of the coke deposits could be performed during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction by operando Raman spectroscopy. (49, 180, 346) Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes.Author Information Corresponding Author Bert M.
