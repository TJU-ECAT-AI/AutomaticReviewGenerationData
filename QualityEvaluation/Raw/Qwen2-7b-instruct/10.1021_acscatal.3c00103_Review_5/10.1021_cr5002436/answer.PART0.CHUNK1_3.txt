[1] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[2] "Coke deposition effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[3] "The presence of carbon deposits on the surface does not always negatively influence catalyst performance. Indeed, a low amount of coke deposition has been observed to increase the catalytic activity by facilitating the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site."
[4] "However, it is important to note that the presence of carbon deposits on the support has a milder negative effect on catalyst activity."
[5] "For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the same differences of specific activities between the Pt and metal oxide catalysts are observed."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxide-based catalysts like gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx). These alternatives aim to reduce the high cost and environmental impact associated with noble metals while maintaining or improving performance metrics such as specific activity and stability.

Opportunities in PDH include the potential for increased efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability in propylene production. For example, the use of metal oxides can potentially lead to lower catalyst costs compared to noble metals. Moreover, advancements in catalyst design, such as incorporating promoters or optimizing support materials, can enhance activity and stability. 

Thermodynamic limitations pose a significant challenge, as achieving full conversion of propane to propylene requires overcoming the equilibrium barriers inherent to the reaction. Researchers are exploring oxidative dehydrogenation pathways and alternative reaction conditions to mitigate these limitations. 

Catalysts with high-temperature stability are crucial for maintaining efficiency at the high reaction temperatures required for PDH. This necessitates the development of materials that can withstand harsh conditions without deactivating prematurely.

Propylene selectivity is another key focus, as high selectivity leads to greater efficiency in propylene production and minimizes the formation of undesirable byproducts. Catalysts that minimize side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, are preferred.

Resistance to side reactions, particularly hydrogenolysis, is critical to ensure that the majority of the reactants are converted to propylene rather than forming other products. This requires the development of catalysts with optimized active sites and structures that inhibit non-desired pathways.

The presence of carbon deposits (coking) on catalyst surfaces can hinder activity by blocking active sites and pores. Researchers are investigating strategies to prevent coking or mitigate its effects, such as modifying catalyst surfaces to reduce coking propensity or developing regeneration techniques that can remove deposited carbon without causing irreversible damage to the catalyst.

Specific activities of catalysts, which refer to their ability to produce olefin products per unit mass and time, are important for achieving high yields at high space velocities. Pt-based catalysts are noted for their high specific activities, which can enable efficient and cost-effective propylene production.

Metal oxides, such as gallium oxide, have been shown to offer competitive yields to Pt-based catalysts but at potentially lower costs and with improved stability in some cases. This makes them promising candidates for reducing the overall cost of PDH processes.

By addressing these challenges and exploiting opportunities, researchers aim to optimize PDH processes, leading to more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective propylene production.

工业丙烯生产中丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战包括催化剂在高温下的稳定性、高丙烯选择性和对副反应的抗性。研究人员通过开发新的催化剂配方和改进现有配方来应对这些挑战。例如，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和钼氧化物（MoOx）等金属氧化物已被探索作为铂（Pt）、铬氧化物（CrOx）等贵金属的替代品，旨在降低贵金属的高昂成本和环境影响，同时保持或提高性能指标如特定活性和稳定性。

PDH的机会包括提高效率、降低成本和可持续性。例如，使用金属氧化物可以潜在地降低催化剂成本与贵金属相比。此外，催化剂设计的改进，如集成促进剂或优化支撑材料，可以增强活性和稳定性。

热力学限制是PDH的一个重大挑战，因为完全将丙烷转化为丙烯需要克服反应固有的平衡壁垒。研究人员正在探索氧化性脱氢路径以及替代反应条件以缓解这些限制。

高温稳定性高的催化剂对于在PDH所需的苛刻条件下维持效率至关重要。这需要开发能够在不提前失效的情况下承受严酷条件的材料。

丙烯选择性是另一个关键焦点，因为高选择性导致丙烯生产效率更高，并且可以减少形成其他产品的副产品。倾向于减少非期望途径的催化剂是首选。

对副反应（如氢解）的抵抗力对于确保大多数反应物被转化为丙烯而不是形成其他产物至关重要。这需要开发具有优化活性位点和结构的催化剂，以抑制非期望路径。

碳沉积（结焦）在催化剂表面上的存在会阻碍活性位点和孔道，从而降低活性。研究人员正在调查防止沉积或减轻其影响的战略，如修改催化剂表面以减少沉积倾向，或者开发可以去除沉积碳而不造成催化剂不可逆损害的再生技术。

特定活性是指每单位质量和时间产生烯烃产物的能力，对于实现高空间速度时的高产率至关重要。铂基催化剂因其高特定活性而闻名，这可以实现高效和经济的丙烯生产。

金属氧化物，如镓氧化物，已显示出与铂基催化剂竞争性的产率，但在某些情况下成本更低且稳定性更好。这使它们成为降低PDH过程总体成本的有前景的候选者。

通过解决这些挑战并利用机会，研究人员旨在优化PDH过程，最终实现更高效、更可持续和更经济的丙烯生产。
