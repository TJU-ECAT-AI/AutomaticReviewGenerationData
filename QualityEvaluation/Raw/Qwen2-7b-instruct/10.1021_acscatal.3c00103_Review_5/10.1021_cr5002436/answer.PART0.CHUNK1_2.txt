[1] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[2] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[3] "Catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."

1. Coke accumulation blocks pores and active sites, causing a decline in catalytic activity.
2. Coke can grow from aromatic rings through DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains.
3. Higher space velocities accelerate catalyst deactivation.
4. Despite years of research, no viable alternative to PtSn or CrOx catalysts has emerged.
5. Many new PDH projects plan to use CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts.

1. 焦炭积累会阻塞孔隙和活性位点，导致催化活性下降。
2. 焦炭可以从芳环通过迪尔斯-阿尔德反应、丙烯添加到自由基或小域融合成大块的方式生长。
3. 更高的空间速度加速催化剂失活。
4. 尽管过去几十年进行了大量研究，但尚未找到可行的PtSn或CrOx系统的替代品。
5. 许多新的PDH项目计划使用CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin）或PtSn/Al2O3（Oleflex）催化剂。
