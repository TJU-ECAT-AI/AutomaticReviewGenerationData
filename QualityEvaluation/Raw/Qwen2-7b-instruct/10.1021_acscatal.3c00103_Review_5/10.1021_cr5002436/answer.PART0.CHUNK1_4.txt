[1] "Deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition."
[2] "The reversibility of deactivation is crucial for the efficiency of the process. Recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[3] "Catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

1. Deactivation in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) occurs due to strong adsorption of reactants on active sites and coke deposition. Recent advancements suggest that operando spectroscopy could enable better control over the process in the future.

2. Higher space velocities accelerate the deactivation of catalysts, highlighting the importance of optimizing reaction conditions.

3. Despite extensive research, practical alternatives to the platinum and chromium oxide-based catalysts for PDH have not emerged, with metal oxides like gallium oxide (GaOx), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (VOx) receiving notable attention.

4. The reversible deactivation of catalysts is a critical issue in PDH, and coke deposition plays a significant role in this process. Careful control of regeneration conditions is necessary to prevent irreversible deactivation.

5. The elimination of coke from spent catalysts requires meticulous handling to avoid catalyst damage, emphasizing the need for optimized regeneration techniques.

1. 催化剂失活主要由活性位点上反应物的强吸附和结焦沉积引起。近来的研究指出，原位光谱技术可能为过程控制提供更高级的方法。

2. 更高的空间速度会加速催化剂的失活，强调了优化反应条件的重要性。

3. 尽管进行了大量研究，但至今尚未找到实用的替代铂和铬氧化物催化剂的PDH方法，镓氧化物（GaOx）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（VOx）等金属氧化物受到了特别关注。

4. 催化剂的可逆失活是PDH过程中的一大问题，而结焦在这一过程中起着关键作用。精心控制再生条件对于避免催化剂不可逆失活至关重要。

5. 从使用过的催化剂中去除结焦需要仔细处理，以避免催化剂损害，这强调了优化再生技术的必要性。
