[1] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[2] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[3] "However, there has been a clear consensus in the literature since the mid-1970s identifying coke deposition as the main cause of deactivation."
[4] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[5] "Indeed, olefins in the stream can easily react with the carbocation intermediates formed on these acid sites."
[6] "Additionally, strong adsorption of reaction intermediates, such as the ethylidyne or ethyne species discussed above, and/or products on active sites can also induce polymerization and lead to the formation of graphitic sheets."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production involve the need for catalysts that exhibit high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. These challenges are complicated by thermodynamic limitations inherent to the dehydrogenation process. Researchers are addressing these issues by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (Vox) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are traditionally used but suffer from high costs, environmental concerns, and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies for controlling coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving selectivity are key areas of focus.

The opportunities lie in the potential for reducing the dependence on crude oil as a feedstock for propylene production by utilizing abundant natural gas resources. The recent surge in shale gas production has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. This has sparked interest in alternative methods such as oxidative dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes, which offer competitive alternatives to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Advances in catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process control are expected to lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies.

To overcome the thermodynamic limitations, researchers aim to find combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that enable full conversion of paraffins in oxidative dehydrogenation while maintaining high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, such as ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3), are being investigated for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the dehydrogenation reaction. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) can also catalyze the selective hydrogen combustion process, although they require oxygen to be fed to the reactor to facilitate the reaction.

Alternative solutions involve the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach allows for nearly complete conversion of paraffins while minimizing side reactions. However, the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration needs to be carefully managed, especially in industrial settings, to optimize process efficiency and minimize downtime. Recent advancements in operando spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman/UV-vis spectroscopy, are enabling more precise monitoring of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, providing insights for dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.

工业丙烯生产中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战包括需要具有高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和抗副反应的催化剂。这些挑战受到脱氢过程固有的热力学限制的复杂性。研究人员通过开发新的催化剂配方和改进现有配方来解决这些问题。例如，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（Vox）等金属氧化物被用作铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）等传统使用的贵金属的替代品，这些贵金属成本高、环境问题大，并且由于焦炭沉积导致快速失效。控制焦炭形成、增强催化剂稳定性和提高选择性的策略是研究的重点领域。

机会在于利用丰富的天然气资源减少对石油作为丙烯生产原料的依赖。近年来，页岩气产量的增加使得天然气在经济上比原油更便宜，这激发了对替代方法的兴趣，如氧化脱氢和甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程，它们与传统的裂化催化和蒸汽裂化相比提供了竞争力。催化剂设计、反应工程和过程控制的进步预计会带来更高效和可持续的PDH技术。

为了克服热力学限制，研究人员旨在找到催化剂材料和氧化剂的组合，使氧化脱氢过程中的全转化成为可能，同时保持高烯烃选择性。固体氧载体，如氧化铈（CeO2）、锑氧化物（SbO4）、铟氧化物（In2O3）、钨氧化物（WO3）、铅氧化物（PbOx）、铊氧化物（Tl2O3）和铋氧化物（BiO3），正在被研究用于选择性氧化脱氢反应中产生的氢。贵金属如钯（Pd）和金（Au）也可以催化选择性氢燃烧过程，尽管它们需要向反应器提供氧气以促进反应。

膜技术的另一种解决方案是通过从反应混合物中去除氢，将平衡转移到所需的烯烃产品。这种方法允许几乎完全转化为烯烃，同时最大限度地减少副反应。然而，催化剂失活和再生之间的相互作用需要在工业环境中仔细管理，以优化过程效率并减少停机时间。最近在原位光谱技术方面的进展，如拉曼/紫外-可见光谱，正在为更精确监测催化剂失活和焦炭形成提供见解，提供动态调整脱氢和再生阶段的方法。
