The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production involve the need for catalysts that exhibit high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. These challenges are complicated by thermodynamic limitations inherent to the dehydrogenation process. Researchers are addressing these issues by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (Vox) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are traditionally used but suffer from high costs, environmental concerns, and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies for controlling coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving selectivity are key areas of focus.

The opportunities lie in the potential for reducing the dependence on crude oil as a feedstock for propylene production by utilizing abundant natural gas resources. The recent surge in shale gas production has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. This has sparked interest in alternative methods such as oxidative dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes, which offer competitive alternatives to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Advances in catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process control are expected to lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies.

To overcome the thermodynamic limitations, researchers aim to find combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that enable full conversion of paraffins in oxidative dehydrogenation while maintaining high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, such as ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3), are being investigated for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the dehydrogenation reaction. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) can also catalyze the selective hydrogen combustion process, although they require oxygen to be fed to the reactor to facilitate the reaction.

Alternative solutions involve the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach allows for nearly complete conversion of paraffins while minimizing side reactions. However, the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration needs to be carefully managed, especially in industrial settings, to optimize process efficiency and minimize downtime. Recent advancements in operando spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman/UV-vis spectroscopy, are enabling more precise monitoring of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, providing insights for dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.

工业丙烯生产中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战包括需要具有高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和抗副反应的催化剂。这些挑战受到脱氢过程固有的热力学限制的复杂性。研究人员通过开发新的催化剂配方和改进现有配方来解决这些问题。例如，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（Vox）等金属氧化物被用作铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）等传统使用的贵金属的替代品，这些贵金属成本高、环境问题大，并且由于焦炭沉积导致快速失效。控制焦炭形成、增强催化剂稳定性和提高选择性的策略是研究的重点领域。

机会在于利用丰富的天然气资源减少对石油作为丙烯生产原料的依赖。近年来，页岩气产量的增加使得天然气在经济上比原油更便宜，这激发了对替代方法的兴趣，如氧化脱氢和甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程，它们与传统的裂化催化和蒸汽裂化相比提供了竞争力。催化剂设计、反应工程和过程控制的进步预计会带来更高效和可持续的PDH技术。

为了克服热力学限制，研究人员旨在找到催化剂材料和氧化剂的组合，使氧化脱氢过程中的全转化成为可能，同时保持高烯烃选择性。固体氧载体，如氧化铈（CeO2）、锑氧化物（SbO4）、铟氧化物（In2O3）、钨氧化物（WO3）、铅氧化物（PbOx）、铊氧化物（Tl2O3）和铋氧化物（BiO3），正在被研究用于选择性氧化脱氢反应中产生的氢。贵金属如钯（Pd）和金（Au）也可以催化选择性氢燃烧过程，尽管它们需要向反应器提供氧气以促进反应。

膜技术的另一种解决方案是通过从反应混合物中去除氢，将平衡转移到所需的烯烃产品。这种方法允许几乎完全转化为烯烃，同时最大限度地减少副反应。然而，催化剂失活和再生之间的相互作用需要在工业环境中仔细管理，以优化过程效率并减少停机时间。最近在原位光谱技术方面的进展，如拉曼/紫外-可见光谱，正在为更精确监测催化剂失活和焦炭形成提供见解，提供动态调整脱氢和再生阶段的方法。

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxide-based catalysts like gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx). These alternatives aim to reduce the high cost and environmental impact associated with noble metals while maintaining or improving performance metrics such as specific activity and stability.

Opportunities in PDH include the potential for increased efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability in propylene production. For example, the use of metal oxides can potentially lead to lower catalyst costs compared to noble metals. Moreover, advancements in catalyst design, such as incorporating promoters or optimizing support materials, can enhance activity and stability. 

Thermodynamic limitations pose a significant challenge, as achieving full conversion of propane to propylene requires overcoming the equilibrium barriers inherent to the reaction. Researchers are exploring oxidative dehydrogenation pathways and alternative reaction conditions to mitigate these limitations. 

Catalysts with high-temperature stability are crucial for maintaining efficiency at the high reaction temperatures required for PDH. This necessitates the development of materials that can withstand harsh conditions without deactivating prematurely.

Propylene selectivity is another key focus, as high selectivity leads to greater efficiency in propylene production and minimizes the formation of undesirable byproducts. Catalysts that minimize side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, are preferred.

Resistance to side reactions, particularly hydrogenolysis, is critical to ensure that the majority of the reactants are converted to propylene rather than forming other products. This requires the development of catalysts with optimized active sites and structures that inhibit non-desired pathways.

The presence of carbon deposits (coking) on catalyst surfaces can hinder activity by blocking active sites and pores. Researchers are investigating strategies to prevent coking or mitigate its effects, such as modifying catalyst surfaces to reduce coking propensity or developing regeneration techniques that can remove deposited carbon without causing irreversible damage to the catalyst.

Specific activities of catalysts, which refer to their ability to produce olefin products per unit mass and time, are important for achieving high yields at high space velocities. Pt-based catalysts are noted for their high specific activities, which can enable efficient and cost-effective propylene production.

Metal oxides, such as gallium oxide, have been shown to offer competitive yields to Pt-based catalysts but at potentially lower costs and with improved stability in some cases. This makes them promising candidates for reducing the overall cost of PDH processes.

By addressing these challenges and exploiting opportunities, researchers aim to optimize PDH processes, leading to more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective propylene production.

热力学限制是PDH的一个重大挑战，因为完全将丙烷转化为丙烯需要克服反应固有的平衡壁垒。研究人员正在探索氧化性脱氢路径以及替代反应条件以缓解这些限制。

高温稳定性高的催化剂对于在PDH所需的苛刻条件下维持效率至关重要。这需要开发能够在不提前失效的情况下承受严酷条件的材料。

丙烯选择性是另一个关键焦点，因为高选择性导致丙烯生产效率更高，并且可以减少形成其他产品的副产品。倾向于减少非期望途径的催化剂是首选。

对副反应（如氢解）的抵抗力对于确保大多数反应物被转化为丙烯而不是形成其他产物至关重要。这需要开发具有优化活性位点和结构的催化剂，以抑制非期望路径。

碳沉积（结焦）在催化剂表面上的存在会阻碍活性位点和孔道，从而降低活性。研究人员正在调查防止沉积或减轻其影响的战略，如修改催化剂表面以减少沉积倾向，或者开发可以去除沉积碳而不造成催化剂不可逆损害的再生技术。

特定活性是指每单位质量和时间产生烯烃产物的能力，对于实现高空间速度时的高产率至关重要。铂基催化剂因其高特定活性而闻名，这可以实现高效和经济的丙烯生产。

金属氧化物，如镓氧化物，已显示出与铂基催化剂竞争性的产率，但在某些情况下成本更低且稳定性更好。这使它们成为降低PDH过程总体成本的有前景的候选者。

通过解决这些挑战并利用机会，研究人员旨在优化PDH过程，最终实现更高效、更可持续和更经济的丙烯生产。

The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production revolve around achieving high-temperature stability, maintaining high propylene selectivity, and resisting side reactions. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing catalysts that can withstand high temperatures without degrading too quickly, by enhancing the selectivity towards propylene over other olefins, and by minimizing the occurrence of unwanted side reactions like cracking and hydrogenolysis. Thermodynamic limitations, which necessitate higher reaction temperatures and/or lower paraffin partial pressures for achieving high conversions, are also being tackled by employing strategies such as diluting the paraffin feed with steam or using selective hydrogen combustion to shift the equilibrium towards olefin formation. The opportunity lies in the growing demand for propylene, driven by its use in various industries, especially the automotive sector, and the shift towards using cheaper natural gas liquids, like ethane, as feedstock for steam cracking processes. This shift is enabling the construction of new PDH facilities in regions like the United States and China, which will employ advanced technologies such as Catofin or Oleflex to produce propylene more efficiently and sustainably.
