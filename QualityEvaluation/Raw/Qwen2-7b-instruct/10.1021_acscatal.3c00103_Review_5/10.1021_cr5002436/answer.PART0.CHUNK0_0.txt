[1] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[2] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[6] "Notably, the reaction equilibrium can be shifted to higher paraffin conversions by reducing the partial pressure of the paraffin or by withdrawing the hydrogen produced."

1. The petrochemical industry faces challenges due to high energy demands, low selectivity, declining oil reserves, and rising oil prices, prompting the search for more efficient conversion technologies and economical feedstocks.
2. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGL), including ethane and propane, which are easily separable from natural gas.
3. Propane dehydrogenation's profitability is heavily influenced by the price gap between propane and propylene, making current market conditions advantageous.
4. The rise in butadiene prices is a result of increased demand from the automotive sector, coupled with a decrease in supply due to the high costs associated with naphtha cracking.
5. The dehydrogenation reaction is thermodynamically constrained and endothermic, necessitating higher temperatures and reduced paraffin partial pressures to achieve substantial conversions.
6. Reducing the paraffin partial pressure or extracting hydrogen can shift the reaction equilibrium towards higher paraffin conversions.
