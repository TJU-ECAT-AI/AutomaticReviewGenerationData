[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown."
[3] "In addition, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[4] "This includes light olefins, which can be obtained by first converting natural gas into synthesis gas and by subsequently converting the latter either directly through the Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins (FTO) process or indirectly through the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) route with an intermediate methanol synthesis step."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[7] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[8] "The supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[9] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[10] "Moreover, the high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry. 
2.A detailed depiction of the olefin supply and demand trends, along with their applications, is presented in Figure 1.
3.More specific details about the products derived from olefins are displayed on the right side of the graph.
4.Light olefins can be produced from natural gas via Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-olefins processes.
5.Shale gas has led to a shift in steam cracking from naphtha to ethane, driving the construction of ethane crackers and potentially dismantling or converting naphtha crackers.
6.Propane dehydrogenation's profitability hinges on the price disparity between propane and propylene, which has been advantageous recently.
7.A significant expansion of PDH installations is anticipated globally, with many projects already underway.
8.The decline in propylene supply and its price spike have opened avenues for on-purpose catalytic technologies, including PDH.
9.Currently, approximately 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually through PDH.
10.The switch from naphtha to ethane for steam cracking installations in the US is partly due to the abundant and affordable ethane supply.
