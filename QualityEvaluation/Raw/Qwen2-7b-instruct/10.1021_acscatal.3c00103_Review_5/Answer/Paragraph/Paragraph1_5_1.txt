        The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production involve the need for catalysts that exhibit high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. These challenges are complicated by thermodynamic limitations inherent to the dehydrogenation process. Researchers are addressing these issues by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (Vox) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are traditionally used but suffer from high costs, environmental concerns, and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies for controlling coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving selectivity are key areas of focus.
        
        Opportunities lie in the potential for reducing the dependence on crude oil as a feedstock for propylene production by utilizing abundant natural gas resources. The recent surge in shale gas production has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. This has sparked interest in alternative methods such as oxidative dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes, which offer competitive alternatives to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Advances in catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process control are expected to lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies.
        
        To overcome the thermodynamic limitations, researchers aim to find combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that enable full conversion of paraffins in oxidative dehydrogenation while maintaining high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, such as ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3), are being investigated for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the dehydrogenation reaction. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) can also catalyze the selective hydrogen combustion process, although they require oxygen to be fed to the reactor to facilitate the reaction.
        
        Alternative solutions involve the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach allows for nearly complete conversion of paraffins while minimizing side reactions. However, the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration needs to be carefully managed, especially in industrial settings, to optimize process efficiency and minimize downtime. Recent advancements in operando spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman/UV-vis spectroscopy, are enabling more precise monitoring of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, providing insights for dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced thermal stability, improved selectivity, and the ability to operate under harsh conditions without significant coke formation. The integration of advanced materials science, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal-organic polymeric networks (MOPNs), could lead to the creation of novel catalyst architectures capable of achieving higher propylene yields and purity. Additionally, the development of in-situ monitoring and real-time control systems for PDH processes could significantly enhance operational efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Furthermore, the exploration of bio-based feedstocks and the optimization of biocatalysis for PDH could contribute to more sustainable and environmentally friendly propylene production routes. These avenues offer promising directions for advancing PDH technology and addressing the challenges in industrial propylene production.

        在工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战在于需要催化剂表现出高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和对副反应的抵抗性。这些挑战由脱氢过程固有的热力学限制所复杂化。研究人员通过开发新的催化剂配方和改进现有配方来解决这些问题。例如，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（Vox）已被探索作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）等贵金属的替代品，后者在传统应用中因成本高、环境问题和由于焦炭形成导致的快速失活而受到使用。控制焦炭形成、增强催化剂稳定性和提高选择性的策略是关键研究领域。
        
        减少对原油作为丙烯原料依赖的机会在于利用丰富的天然气资源。近年来页岩气产量的激增使天然气成为比原油更经济的原料。这激发了替代方法的兴趣，如氧化脱氢和甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程，它们为传统的裂化方法（如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂化）提供了有竞争力的替代方案。催化剂设计、反应工程和过程控制的进步有望带来更高效、更可持续的PDH技术。
        
        为了克服热力学限制，研究人员致力于寻找能够实现全转化的催化剂材料组合和氧化剂，在氧化脱氢过程中保持高烯烃选择性。固体氧化载体，如氧化铈（CeO2）、锑氧化物（SbO4）、铟氧化物（In2O3）、钨氧化物（WO3）、铅氧化物（PbOx）、铊氧化物（Tl2O3）和铋氧化物（BiO3），正在研究其能力以选择性地氧化脱氢反应中产生的氢。钯（Pd）和金（Au）等贵金属也可以催化选择性氢燃烧过程，尽管它们需要氧气输入到反应器中以促进反应。
        
        替代解决方案涉及使用膜去除反应混合物中的氢，将平衡转移到所需的烯烃产品上。这种方法允许几乎完全转化的烷烃同时减少副反应。然而，催化剂失活与再生之间的相互作用需要在工业设置中谨慎管理，以优化过程效率并减少停机时间。最近的操作原位光谱技术进步，如拉曼/紫外-可见光谱，能够更精确地监测催化剂失活和焦炭形成，为动态调整脱氢和再生阶段提供见解。
