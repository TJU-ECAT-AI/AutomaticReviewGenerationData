            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more robust catalyst materials that can withstand higher temperatures without deactivating due to coke formation. Additionally, there is potential to enhance propylene selectivity through the optimization of catalyst composition and structure, ensuring that the majority of the produced olefins are propylene rather than other lighter or heavier hydrocarbons. The integration of advanced operando spectroscopy techniques could provide real-time insights into the dynamic behavior of catalysts under various operating conditions, facilitating the development of adaptive control strategies for efficient and continuous operation of PDH processes. Furthermore, exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple catalysts or catalyst additives could lead to the creation of multifunctional catalysts capable of simultaneously addressing the challenges of high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and thermodynamic limitations. The field may also benefit from the development of new reaction pathways or alternative feedstocks that can bypass some of the thermodynamic hurdles encountered in conventional PDH processes, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable propylene production methods.
