        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cr5002436]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/cr5002436], [10.1021/cr5002436], and [10.1021/cr5002436]. The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production involve the need for catalysts that exhibit high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. These challenges are complicated by thermodynamic limitations inherent to the dehydrogenation process. Researchers are addressing these issues by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (Vox) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are traditionally used but suffer from high costs, environmental concerns, and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies for controlling coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving selectivity are key areas of focus.

        Opportunities lie in the potential for reducing the dependence on crude oil as a feedstock for propylene production by utilizing abundant natural gas resources. The recent surge in shale gas production has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. This has sparked interest in alternative methods such as oxidative dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes, which offer competitive alternatives to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Advances in catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process control are expected to lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies.

        To overcome the thermodynamic limitations, researchers aim to find combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that enable full conversion of paraffins in oxidative dehydrogenation while maintaining high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, such as ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3), are being investigated for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the dehydrogenation reaction. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) can also catalyze the selective hydrogen combustion process, although they require oxygen to be fed to the reactor to facilitate the reaction.

        Alternative solutions involve the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach allows for nearly complete conversion of paraffins while minimizing side reactions. However, the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration needs to be carefully managed, especially in industrial settings, to optimize process efficiency and minimize downtime. Recent advancements in operando spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman/UV-vis spectroscopy, are enabling more precise monitoring of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, providing insights for dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.

Future research endeavors might focus on refining catalyst materials to enhance their stability under high temperatures, optimizing the interaction between catalysts and oxidizers to improve selectivity and efficiency, and developing more effective methods for monitoring and managing coke formation and deactivation. Additionally, integrating advanced computational modeling with experimental techniques could provide deeper insights into the complex mechanisms driving PDH, paving the way for the development of next-generation catalysts capable of achieving higher propylene yields with reduced environmental impact.

        基于参考文献[10.1021/cr5002436]的深度分析。从参考文献[10.1021/cr5002436]、[10.1021/cr5002436]和[10.1021/cr5002436]中获得的综合理解。工业丙烯生产中丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战涉及催化剂的高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和对副反应的抵抗力。这些挑战由脱氢过程固有的热力学限制所复杂化。研究人员通过开发新的催化剂配方并改进现有配方来解决这些问题。例如，如镓氧化物（Ga2O3）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（Vox）等金属氧化物被用作铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）等贵金属的替代品，这些贵金属传统上使用，但存在成本高、环境问题以及由于焦炭沉积导致的快速失活的问题。控制焦炭形成、增强催化剂稳定性并提高选择性是关键研究领域。

        机会在于减少对原油作为丙烯原料的依赖，利用丰富的天然气资源。近年来页岩气产量的增长使天然气成为比原油更经济的原料。这激发了对替代方法的兴趣，如氧化脱氢和甲醇至烯烃（MTO）过程，它们为传统的裂化方法（如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂化）提供了竞争性的替代方案。催化剂设计、反应工程和过程控制的进步有望推动PDH技术更加高效和可持续。

        为了克服热力学限制，研究人员致力于找到能够实现氧化脱氢下全转化的催化剂材料组合，并保持高烯烃选择性。如氧化铈（CeO2）、锑氧化物（SbO4）、铟氧化物（In2O3）、钨氧化物（WO3）、铅氧化物（PbOx）、铊氧化物（Tl2O3）和铋氧化物（BiO3）等固体氧化剂正在被研究用于选择性氧化脱氢过程中产生的氢。如钯（Pd）和金（Au）等贵金属也可以催化选择性氢燃烧过程，尽管它们需要氧气在反应器中提供以促进反应。

        替代解决方案包括使用膜从反应混合物中去除氢，将平衡转移到所需的烯烃产品。这种方法允许几乎完全转化的烷烃同时最小化副反应。然而，在工业设置中，催化剂失活和再生之间的相互作用需要谨慎管理，以优化过程效率并减少停机时间。最近的操作原位光谱技术进步，如拉曼/紫外-可见光谱，使更精确地监控催化剂失活和焦炭形成成为可能，为动态调整脱氢和再生阶段提供了见解。
