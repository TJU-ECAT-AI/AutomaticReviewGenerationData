4. Conclusion and Outlook
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts. Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production.
Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts. In this review, we have briefly introduced reasons for sintering and coke formation and how they impact catalytic stability. Small-sized particles with high surface energy tend to agglomerate into large particles during the PDH process, causing rapid deactivation, while coke generated from side reactions under high temperatures can deposit on the active sites, inhibiting the contact of reactants. Currently, there still exist intricate debates over the behavior of sintering and coke formation, which is complicated and needs further research.
Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability. Though great progress has been made, there are still challenges remaining to be solved, including the following:
(1) Adding promoters is one of the most efficient strategies in active site regulation to inhibit sintering and coke deposition. Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical. Meantime, for metal oxide-based catalytic systems, the introduction of inappropriate oxides may suppress the intrinsic activity of active compounds. Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent.
(2) The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites. At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC. However, the complicated processes for the fabrication of supports with uniform organic groups and expensive TMPs make it difficult to apply in practical production. The hydroxyl groups on zeolites also can be used to anchor active sites into the zeolite framework, whereas post-treatment of current zeolites for fabricating hydroxyl nests could reduce the crystallinity of supports, causing low hydrothermal stability and a high surface barrier, severely limiting intracrystal diffusion. Thus, an alternative strategy needs to be developed imminently.
(3) Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation. At the present stage, controllably encapsulating metal or metal oxide clusters into a zeolite matrix can be achieved through the ligand-protected direct synthesis route, making full use of the cooperation effect among organic groups. However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex. The ALD technique provides an advanced method to add a protective layer for encapsulating active compounds. At the present stage, the complicated production processes and the expensive raw materials are still big problems that limit the further application in industrial production. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an economical and universal strategy to realize controllable encapsulation.
(4) For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems. Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production. Mesoporous zeolites can serve as potential supports for PDH reaction due to their lower diffusion limitation compared to microporous zeolites. The amorphous structure of mesoporous zeolites induces low hydrothermal stability and weak interactions for the fixation of active components. Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites. Currently, the methods of synthesizing hierarchical zeolites can be classified into two sorts: top-down and bottom-up methods. The former, which are post-treatment processes, including dealumnization, desiliconization, and recrystallization, can induce low hydrothermal stability and poor repeatability, while the latter, which utilize porogens in the synthesis process, need expensive templates and complicated synthesis routes that are uneconomical. Therefore, there is still a long way to explore facile templates and simplify the synthesis process.
In conclusion, we have summarized the mechanism of catalytic deactivation and the advanced strategies in catalytic design for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. We hope that this review will provide different insights on catalyst design and promote the development of propane dehydrogenation.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/cr5002436\], \[10.1021/cr5002436\], and \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Thermodynamic limitations further complicate this process. Researchers address these issues through the development of new catalyst formulations and improvements to existing ones. Metal oxides like gallium oxide (Ga2O3), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (Vox) are explored as alternatives to traditional catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which suffer from high costs, environmental concerns, and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies focus on controlling coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving selectivity.

            Opportunities arise from reducing propylene production's dependence on crude oil, leveraging abundant natural gas resources. Shale gas production's economic advantage over crude oil fuels interest in alternative methods such as oxidative dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes. Advances in catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process control are anticipated to lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies.

            To overcome thermodynamic limitations, researchers seek combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that allow for full conversion of paraffins in oxidative dehydrogenation while maintaining high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, including ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3), are under investigation for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the dehydrogenation reaction. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) can catalyze the selective hydrogen combustion process, requiring oxygen for reaction facilitation.

            Alternative solutions include the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach enables near-complete conversion of paraffins while minimizing side reactions. Careful management of the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration is crucial for optimizing industrial process efficiency and minimizing downtime. Recent advancements in operando spectroscopy techniques provide insights into dynamic adjustments of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases, enhancing catalyst monitoring and performance optimization.

            The integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings in the file, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research might focus on refining catalyst formulations for improved performance, developing novel reaction mechanisms, and integrating advanced monitoring technologies to enhance process control and efficiency. The potential for integrating renewable energy sources and exploring novel reaction pathways could also expand the scope of sustainable PDH technologies, paving the way for a more environmentally friendly and economically viable production of propylene.
