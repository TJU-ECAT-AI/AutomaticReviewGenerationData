The formation of coke is a complex process that is not fully understood. Accumulation of coke impedes the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity. It is interesting to note that a modest amount of coke deposition can sometimes boost the catalytic activity by assisting in the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site. Nonetheless, the presence of carbon deposits on the support material has a less pronounced negative impact on catalyst performance. When considering isobutane dehydrogenation, the specific activities of catalysts based on platinum (Pt) and metal oxides exhibit comparable differences.
