          The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production involve the need for catalysts that exhibit high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. These challenges are complicated by thermodynamic limitations inherent to the dehydrogenation process. Researchers are addressing these issues by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (Vox) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are traditionally used but suffer from high costs, environmental concerns, and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies for controlling coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving selectivity are key areas of focus.

          Opportunities lie in the potential for reducing the dependence on crude oil as a feedstock for propylene production by utilizing abundant natural gas resources. The recent surge in shale gas production has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. This has sparked interest in alternative methods such as oxidative dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes, which offer competitive alternatives to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Advances in catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process control are expected to lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies.

          To overcome the thermodynamic limitations, researchers aim to find combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that enable full conversion of paraffins in oxidative dehydrogenation while maintaining high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, such as ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3), are being investigated for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the dehydrogenation reaction. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) can also catalyze the selective hydrogen combustion process, although they require oxygen to be fed to the reactor to facilitate the reaction.

          Alternative solutions involve the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach allows for nearly complete conversion of paraffins while minimizing side reactions. However, the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration needs to be carefully managed, especially in industrial settings, to optimize process efficiency and minimize downtime. Recent advancements in operando spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman/UV-vis spectroscopy, are enabling more precise monitoring of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, providing insights for dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.

          工业丙烯生产中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战包括需要具有高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和抗副反应的催化剂。这些挑战受到脱氢过程固有的热力学限制的复杂性的影响。研究人员通过开发新的催化剂配方和改进现有的配方来解决这些问题。例如，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（Vox）等金属氧化物被用作铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）等传统使用的贵金属的替代品，这些贵金属成本高、环境问题大，并且由于焦炭沉积导致快速失效。控制焦炭形成、增强催化剂稳定性和提高选择性的策略是研究的重点领域。

          机会在于通过利用丰富的天然气资源减少对石油作为丙烯生产原料的依赖。近年来页岩气产量的增加使得天然气在经济上比原油更有优势。这激发了对替代方法的兴趣，如氧化脱氢和甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程，这些方法为传统方法如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂化提供了竞争性的替代方案。催化剂设计、反应工程和过程控制的进步有望导致更高效和可持续的PDH技术。

          为了克服热力学限制，研究人员致力于寻找催化剂材料和氧化剂的组合，使氧化脱氢过程中的全烷烃转化为可能，同时保持高烯烃选择性。固体氧化载体，如氧化铈（CeO2）、锑氧化物（SbO4）、铟氧化物（In2O3）、钨氧化物（WO3）、铅氧化物（PbOx）、铊氧化物（Tl2O3）和铋氧化物（BiO3），正在被研究用于选择性氧化脱氢反应中产生的氢。贵金属如钯（Pd）和金（Au）也可以催化选择性氢燃烧过程，尽管它们需要向反应器提供氧气以促进反应。

          另一种解决方案涉及使用膜技术从反应混合物中去除氢，从而将平衡向所需的烯烃产品转移。这种方法允许几乎完全转化烷烃，同时最小化副反应。然而，在工业环境中，催化剂失活和再生之间的相互作用需要谨慎管理，以优化过程效率并减少停机时间。最近在原位光谱技术方面的进展，如拉曼/紫外-可见光谱，正在为更精确监测催化剂失活和焦炭形成提供洞察力，为动态调整脱氢和再生阶段提供信息。

          [1] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

          The petrochemical industry faces challenges due to high energy demands, low selectivity, declining oil reserves, and rising oil prices, prompting the search for more economical feedstocks and more efficient conversion technologies. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGL), including ethane and propane, which are easily separable from natural gas. Propane dehydrogenation's profitability is heavily influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, making current market conditions advantageous. The demand for butadiene has increased, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high costs associated with naphtha cracking, leading to sharp increases in butadiene prices. The dehydrogenation reaction is thermodynamically constrained and endothermic, requiring higher temperatures and/or lower paraffin partial pressures to achieve substantial conversions. Reducing the paraffin partial pressure or removing the produced hydrogen can shift the reaction equilibrium towards higher paraffin conversions.

          The dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, yet the exact mechanism remains a subject of ongoing debate. The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is typically employed to explain catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Coke, defined as a collective term for a broad spectrum of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules, tends to form on the catalyst surface during the reaction. Accumulation of coke effectively obstructs the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, leading to a decline in catalytic activity.

          Hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have seen significant improvements, allowing for cost-effective extraction of large volumes of shale gas. This has led to a substantial decrease in gas costs, approximately 75% lower compared to prices in 2005, making shale gas an attractive resource for both energy and as a feedstock for transportation fuels or chemicals. The abundance of relatively inexpensive natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, has driven a shift from using oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane in steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers now being constructed and naphtha crackers either dismantled or converted. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely dependent on the price difference between propane and propylene, indicating very favorable market conditions. Dehydrogenation technologies are advantageous because they produce a specific olefin instead of a mixture of products. While no comprehensive comparison of a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts has been published in a single review article, recent reviews have covered oxidative dehydrogenation technologies and specific families of catalysts. Currently, about 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually through propane dehydrogenation (PDH), a figure expected to significantly increase in the coming years with the announcement of dozens of new PDH installations worldwide, many of which are already in construction. Five main industrial processes for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been patented, with two currently utilized for light olefin production. The Catofin process, developed by CB&I Lummus, is based on the Houdry Catadiene process, originally designed for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. A Catofin dehydrogenation unit is illustrated in Figure 3. The Oleflex process by UOP features a unique reactor design incorporating fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section. The STAR (UHDE) process will debut in two installations in the Middle East for the first time. Alkali metals like potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs) enhance both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Studies on non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation have shown that the order of catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yield is CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2.
