The process of coke formation is complex and not very well understood. Coke deposition significantly impedes the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, thereby reducing catalytic activity. However, it is noteworthy that a small amount of coke deposition might sometimes enhance the catalytic activity by aiding in the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site. It is crucial to acknowledge that the presence of carbon deposits on the support material has a less severe negative impact on catalyst performance. In the context of isobutane dehydrogenation, the specific activities of Pt-based and metal oxide catalysts display comparable variations.
