The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production involve the need for catalysts that exhibit high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. These challenges are complicated by thermodynamic limitations inherent to the dehydrogenation process. Researchers are addressing these issues by developing new catalyst formulations and improving existing ones. For instance, metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (Vox) have been explored as alternatives to noble metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are traditionally used but suffer from high costs, environmental concerns, and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies for controlling coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability, and improving selectivity are key areas of focus.

          Opportunities lie in the potential for reducing the dependence on crude oil as a feedstock for propylene production by utilizing abundant natural gas resources. The recent surge in shale gas production has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. This has sparked interest in alternative methods such as oxidative dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) processes, which offer competitive alternatives to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Advances in catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process control are expected to lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies.

          To overcome the thermodynamic limitations, researchers aim to find combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that enable full conversion of paraffins in oxidative dehydrogenation while maintaining high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, such as ceria (CeO2), antimony oxide (SbO4), indium oxide (In2O3), tungsten oxide (WO3), lead oxide (PbOx), thallium oxide (Tl2O3), and bismuth oxide (BiO3), are being investigated for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the dehydrogenation reaction. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and gold (Au) can also catalyze the selective hydrogen combustion process, although they require oxygen to be fed to the reactor to facilitate the reaction.

          Alternative solutions involve the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach allows for nearly complete conversion of paraffins while minimizing side reactions. However, the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration needs to be carefully managed, especially in industrial settings, to optimize process efficiency and minimize downtime. Recent advancements in operando spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman/UV-vis spectroscopy, are enabling more precise monitoring of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, providing insights for dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases.
