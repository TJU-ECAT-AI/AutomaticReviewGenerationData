The dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, yet the exact mechanism remains a subject of ongoing debate. The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is typically employed to explain catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Coke, defined as a collective term for a broad spectrum of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules, tends to form on the catalyst surface during the reaction. Accumulation of coke effectively obstructs the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, leading to a decline in catalytic activity.
