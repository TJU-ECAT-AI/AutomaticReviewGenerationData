The process of coke formation is complex and not fully understood. Coke deposition impedes the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, leading to a decline in catalytic activity. Interestingly, a small amount of coke deposition can sometimes increase catalytic activity by promoting alkane adsorption near the active dehydrogenation site. However, the presence of carbon deposits on the support material has a less severe impact on catalyst performance. In the case of isobutane dehydrogenation, the specific activities of Pt-based and metal oxide catalysts show similar differences.
