Hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have seen significant improvements, allowing for cost-effective extraction of large volumes of shale gas. This has led to a substantial decrease in gas costs, approximately 75% lower compared to prices in 2005, making shale gas an attractive resource for both energy and as a feedstock for transportation fuels or chemicals. The abundance of relatively inexpensive natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, has driven a shift from using oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane in steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers now being constructed and naphtha crackers either dismantled or converted. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely dependent on the price difference between propane and propylene, indicating very favorable market conditions. Dehydrogenation technologies are advantageous because they produce a specific olefin instead of a mixture of products. While no comprehensive comparison of a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts has been published in a single review article, recent reviews have covered oxidative dehydrogenation technologies and specific families of catalysts. Currently, about 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually through propane dehydrogenation (PDH), a figure expected to significantly increase in the coming years with the announcement of dozens of new PDH installations worldwide, many of which are already in construction. Five main industrial processes for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been patented, with two currently utilized for light olefin production. The Catofin process, developed by CB&I Lummus, is based on the Houdry Catadiene process, originally designed for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. A Catofin dehydrogenation unit is illustrated in Figure 3. The Oleflex process by UOP features a unique reactor design incorporating fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section. The STAR (UHDE) process will debut in two installations in the Middle East for the first time. Alkali metals like potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs) enhance both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Studies on non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation have shown that the order of catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yield is CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2.
