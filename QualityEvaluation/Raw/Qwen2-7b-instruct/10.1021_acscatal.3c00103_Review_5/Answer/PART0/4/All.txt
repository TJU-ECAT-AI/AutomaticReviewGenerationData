The STAR (UHDE) process will debut in two installations in the Middle East for the first time. Alkali metals like potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs) enhance both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Studies on non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation have shown that the order of catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yield is CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2.", "Chinese": "液压裂解或“水力压裂”技术取得了显著进步，使得以成本效益的方式大规模提取页岩气成为可能。这导致天然气成本大幅下降，大约比2005年的价格降低了75%，使页岩气作为能源和生产运输燃料或化学品的原料极具吸引力。相对廉价的天然气液体的高可用性，特别是乙烷，导致美国蒸汽裂解装置从使用石脑油转向使用页岩乙烷，乙烷裂解器正在建设中，而石脑油裂解器要么被拆除，要么被转换。丙烷脱氢的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这表明当前市场条件非常有利。脱氢技术的优势在于它们仅产生特定的烯烃，而不是混合物的产品。尽管没有在单一综述文章中对广泛脱氢催化剂进行全面比较，但近年来发表了关于氧化脱氢技术和其他特定催化剂家族的综述。目前，每年通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产约500万吨丙烯，这一数字预计在未来几年将大幅增加，因为全球宣布了数十个新的PDH安装项目，其中许多项目已经处于建设之中。已经申请专利的五个主要工业轻烷烃脱氢过程，其中有两个目前用于生产轻烯烃。由CB&I Lummus开发的Catofin过程基于Houdry Catadiene过程，最初仅用于异丁烷脱氢至异丁烯。Catofin脱氢单元的示意图见图3。UOP的Oleflex过程采用独特的反应器设计，包括流化床反应器、催化剂再生单元和产品回收部分。首次在中东的两个安装中应用STAR（UHDE）过程。钾（K）、铷（Rb）和铯（Cs）等碱金属既能促进铬基脱氢催化剂的活性，又能提高选择性。关于非氧化性乙烷脱氢的研究显示，基于乙烷转化率和乙烯产率的催化活性顺序为CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
