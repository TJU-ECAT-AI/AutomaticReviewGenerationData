The petrochemical industry faces challenges due to high energy demands, low selectivity, declining oil reserves, and rising oil prices, prompting the search for more economical feedstocks and more efficient conversion technologies. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGL), including ethane and propane, which are easily separable from natural gas. Propane dehydrogenation's profitability is heavily influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, making current market conditions advantageous. The demand for butadiene has increased, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high costs associated with naphtha cracking, leading to sharp increases in butadiene prices. The dehydrogenation reaction is thermodynamically constrained and endothermic, requiring higher temperatures and/or lower paraffin partial pressures to achieve substantial conversions. Reducing the paraffin partial pressure or removing the produced hydrogen can shift the reaction equilibrium towards higher paraffin conversions.
