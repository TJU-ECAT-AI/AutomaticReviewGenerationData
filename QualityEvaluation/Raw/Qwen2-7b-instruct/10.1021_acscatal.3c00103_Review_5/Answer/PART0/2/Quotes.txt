          [3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [4] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
          [5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
          [6] "Notably, the reaction equilibrium can be shifted to higher paraffin conversions by reducing the partial pressure of the paraffin or by withdrawing the hydrogen produced."
