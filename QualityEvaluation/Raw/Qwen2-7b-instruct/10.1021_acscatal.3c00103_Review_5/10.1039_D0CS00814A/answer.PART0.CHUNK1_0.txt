The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include overcoming the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. Researchers are addressing these issues by focusing on catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Opportunities lie in developing advanced dehydrogenation technologies, refining catalyst design, and exploring new chemical pathways. Key to this progress is improving the understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms under real reaction conditions, utilizing advanced characterization techniques, and employing mechanistic investigations. The ultimate goal is to ensure the sustainable and efficient development of propane dehydrogenation processes.
