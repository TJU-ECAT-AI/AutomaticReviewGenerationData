1. The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include overcoming the thermodynamic limitations of the reaction, improving the efficiency at high temperatures, and reducing side reactions. Researchers aim to develop catalysts that have high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Efforts are also directed towards finding alternative dehydrogenation processes that can improve reaction efficiency, such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH).

2. Urgent need for an alternative dehydrogenation process is identified, especially for ODH, which has favorable thermodynamics to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen cofeeding is commonly used to lower the reaction temperature and reduce coke deposition in ODH processes.

3. Continued research is focused on improving the performance of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts through the use of various strategies. The goal is to achieve higher propylene selectivity and lower deactivation rates with reduced noble metal loadings.

4. The adoption of ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, is seen as a means to significantly reduce energy consumption and operating costs compared to traditional thermochemical dehydrogenation processes. However, these processes face limitations due to their insufficient CH activation ability and lack of understanding of reaction mechanisms in these environments.

5. The development of low-temperature and highly selective catalysts is recognized as a key direction for the industrial application of ODH reactions. This includes the optimization of reaction temperature and matching of individual active sites for efficient propylene production.

1. 烯烃脱氢（PDH）工业丙烯生产的首要挑战包括克服反应的热力学限制，提高高温效率，并减少副反应。研究旨在开发具有高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和抗副反应能力的催化剂。同时，寻找可以提高反应效率的替代脱氢过程，如氧化脱氢（ODH）和化学循环氧化脱氢（CL-ODH），也是迫切需要的。

2. 对于ODH，一个紧急的需求是寻找替代的脱氢过程，特别是具有有利热力学特性的ODH，以提高反应效率。通常使用气体氧气共喂料降低反应温度并减少焦炭沉积来降低ODH过程中的温度。

3. 对CrOx-和Pt基催化剂的性能改进研究持续进行，通过使用各种策略。目标是在减少贵金属负载的同时，实现更高的丙烯选择性和更低的失活率。

4. 利用室温或接近室温的催化脱氢过程，如光催化和电催化，被认为是显著降低能源消耗和运营成本的方法，与传统的热化学脱氢过程相比。然而，这些过程面临着不足的CH激活能力和对这些环境中的反应机制缺乏理解的限制。

5. 开发低温和高度选择性的催化剂被视为ODH反应工业应用的关键方向。这包括优化反应温度和匹配单个活性位点，以实现高效的丙烯生产。
