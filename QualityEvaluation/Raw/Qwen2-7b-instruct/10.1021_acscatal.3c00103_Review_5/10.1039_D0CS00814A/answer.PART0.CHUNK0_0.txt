[1] "The rapid developments of dehydrogenation technologies and catalysts urge us to review the progress in recent years. Further understanding on the principles could essentially provide a creative perspective on propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "However, in addition to their high toxicity and environmental hostility, the severe side reactions induce their quick deactivation and frequent regeneration."
[3] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
[4] "The exact active sites of various Pt-based catalysts and the corresponding reaction mechanisms in the PDH process remain controversial."
[5] "While newly developed dehydrogenation processes, catalyst design strategies, and new chemistry in propane dehydrogenation reactions have not been well summarized."
[6] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

1. Researchers are addressing the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by reviewing the advancements in recent years. Understanding the principles behind these processes offers a creative perspective on PDH optimization. Challenges remain in the form of high toxicity and environmental impacts, quick catalyst deactivation due to severe side reactions, and the desire for alternative catalysts with low chromium content. The exact active sites and reaction mechanisms of Pt-based catalysts are still under debate. There is a lack of comprehensive summaries of newly developed dehydrogenation processes, catalyst design strategies, and new chemistry in PDH reactions. Efforts are being made to develop more stable Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and find alternative catalysts through the exploitation of new efficient strategies.
