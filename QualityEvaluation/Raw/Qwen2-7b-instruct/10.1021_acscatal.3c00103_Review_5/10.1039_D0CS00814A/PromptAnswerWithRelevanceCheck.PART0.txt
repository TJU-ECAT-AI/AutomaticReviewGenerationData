1. 在工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战包括需要能够承受高温、保持丙烯选择性并抵抗副反应的催化剂，同时考虑到热力学限制。研究人员通过开发具有较低或无铬含量的替代金属氧化物催化剂以及探索促进剂和支持材料来提高活性和稳定性，以应对这些需求。

2. 在PDH反应中，丙烷的第一个CH键的活化是决定催化剂活性的关键步骤。丙烯更为活跃，容易经历复杂的副反应，如进一步脱氢和裂解。因此，需要精细控制反应条件和催化剂设计以优化选择性和减少不希望的副产物。

3. 对于目前在PDH过程中使用的铂基和铬氧化物催化剂，存在对经济和环境影响较小的替代金属氧化物催化剂的需求。

4. 提高铂基和铬氧化物催化剂的稳定性，以及发现可克服其局限性的替代催化剂，仍然是PDH技术领域的一大挑战。

5. 铬氧化物催化剂显示出高活性和选择性，但稳定性低，其失活速率约为1 mol gCr1 h1 或1 mol gcat1 h1 在0.5 h1的失活率。

6. Al2O3表面存在的配位不饱和五配位Al原子可以显著影响PDH催化剂的催化性能，从而影响其整体性能。

7. 钒氧化物催化剂相对于铬氧化物催化剂显示出较高的活性和抑制失活率，其失活率为约0.3 mol gV1 h1 在0.2 h1的失活率。

8. 关于镓氧化物催化剂的活性位点存在争议，这受到支持类型、制备方法和负载量等因素的影响。研究正在进行中，以改进其活动性和选择性。

9. 由于在脱氢步骤中的碳沉积限制和在氧化还原循环中的烧结限制，氧化锆基催化剂面临重大挑战。继续发展ZrO2基催化剂是一个关键的研究领域。
