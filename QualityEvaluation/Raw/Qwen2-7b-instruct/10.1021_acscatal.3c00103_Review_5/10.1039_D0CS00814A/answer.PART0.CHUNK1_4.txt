[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane undergoes a very complex dehydrogenation network."
[2] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
[3] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
[4] "Although it is generally accepted that numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
[5] "Comparatively, some metal oxides in regions C and D such as InOx-based catalysts show relatively lower activity."
[6] "Importantly, GaOx-based catalysts, in region A, show preferable formation rates at lower deactivation rates, and might be promising alternative PDH catalysts."
[7] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
[8] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
