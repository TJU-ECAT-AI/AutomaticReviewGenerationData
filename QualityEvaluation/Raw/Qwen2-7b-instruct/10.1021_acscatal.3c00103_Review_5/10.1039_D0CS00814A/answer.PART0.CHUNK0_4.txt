[1] "Singly, among these PDH technologies, the Oleflex and Catofin processes have many sets of industrial applications. The STAR process has just been on the way to industrialization. However, the economical and/or environmental issues caused by Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts still require further development."

[2] "In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity. While propylene is more active and can more easily undergo complex side reactions, such as further dehydrogenation and cracking."

[3] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."

[4] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[5] "In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1."

[6] "In addition, the amount of coordinatively unsaturated penta-coordinate Al atoms on the surface of Al2O3 can also have a great impact on the catalytic properties."

[7] "In short, VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts, with about 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1."

[8] "However, the active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts."

[9] "In addition, the bulk ZrO2 showed significant limitations of deactivation for carbon deposit in the dehydrogenation step and sintering in redox cycles. Therefore, the development of ZrO2-based catalysts remains a great challenge."

1. The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts that maintain high-temperature stability, ensure propylene selectivity, and resist side reactions, while accounting for thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with reduced chromium content and exploring the use of promoters and supports to enhance activity and stability.

2. The activation of the first CH bond in propane is crucial for determining the catalyst's activity in PDH reactions. Propylene is more reactive and prone to complex side reactions, such as further dehydrogenation and cracking. This necessitates careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst design to optimize selectivity and minimize unwanted side products.

3. There is a high demand for developing alternative metal oxide catalysts that offer lower economic and environmental impacts compared to Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts currently used in PDH processes.

4. Improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, as well as discovering alternative catalysts that can overcome their limitations, remains a significant challenge in the field of PDH technology.

5. Chromium oxide catalysts demonstrate high reactivity and selectivity, but suffer from low stability. This is reflected in their deactivation rates of around 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at a deactivation rate of 0.5 h1.

6. The presence of coordinatively unsaturated penta-coordinate Al atoms on the surface of Al2O3 can significantly influence the catalytic properties of PDH catalysts, affecting their overall performance.

7. Vanadium oxide catalysts display high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates relative to chromium oxide catalysts, with deactivation rates of around 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at a deactivation rate of 0.2 h1.

8. Gallium oxide catalysts have been the subject of debate regarding their active sites, which are influenced by factors such as support type, preparation method, and loading amount. Research is ongoing to refine their activity and selectivity.

9. Zirconia-based catalysts face significant challenges due to limitations in carbon deposition during the dehydrogenation step and sintering during redox cycles. Development of ZrO2-based catalysts continues to be a critical area of research.
