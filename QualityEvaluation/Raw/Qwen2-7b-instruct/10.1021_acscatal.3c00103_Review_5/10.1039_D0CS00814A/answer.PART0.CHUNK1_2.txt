1. The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while also considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing advanced dehydrogenation technologies, refining catalyst design, and advancing new chemistry. Opportunities exist for improving catalyst efficiency, but significant hurdles remain in areas such as catalyst stability, understanding active sites and mechanisms, and theoretical modeling.

2. High-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions are critical for PDH catalysts. Researchers aim to achieve these qualities through the development of new catalysts with lower noble metal loadings and reduced deactivation rates.

3. Advanced characterization techniques and deeper discussions of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are essential for improving PDH technologies. Researchers must conduct in-depth investigations to fully understand the functioning of catalysts and optimize their performance.

4. Challenges in PDH include the need for intensified dehydrogenation processes, controllable synthesis methodologies, and fine characterization techniques, alongside mechanistic investigations. A combination of these approaches will likely drive the development of PDH technologies forward. However, there are also significant hurdles in areas such as catalyst development, characterization, and theoretical stimulation methods that require consideration and innovation.
