<p>In this context, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9] , Pt-Ga [6] ,[10] , Pt-Cu [1] , Pt-Sn [11] ,[12] ,[13] , and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6] . For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] . Zn, a highly abundant and non-toxic metal, has been explored as a promising modifier of Pt for PDH, but receives much less attention than the post-transition-metals Ga [6] ,[10] and Sn [11] ,[12] . Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15] ,[16] , it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels).</p>
<p>Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17] . To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[18] or SiO2 [19] ,[20] ,[21] are most widely used.</p>
<p>In view of the known activity of Pt and Pt-Zn in PDH and the contribution of Si-Beta support from the so-called confinement effect, we herein report the design and construction of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts for PDH. High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process. We subsequently present detailed analyses on the roles of Si-Beta support, active Pt species and Zn modifier in PDH reaction. The good catalytic performance of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta in the reaction is well explained [26] , and the deactivation mechanism is finally discussed.</p>

1. The primary challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production include achieving high-temperature stability, maintaining high propylene selectivity, and preventing unwanted side reactions. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing catalysts that can operate efficiently under thermodynamic limitations. The opportunity lies in utilizing bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, especially those incorporating Zn as a modifier, which can enhance activity and stability while suppressing coke formation. The goal is to create robust, low-cost catalysts suitable for industrial applications.
