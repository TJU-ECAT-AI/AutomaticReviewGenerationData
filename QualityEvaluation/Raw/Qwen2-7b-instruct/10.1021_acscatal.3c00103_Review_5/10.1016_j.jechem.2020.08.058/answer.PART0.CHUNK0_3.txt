[1] "Propylene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates [1] , is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
[2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes [2] ,[3] ,[4] ."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."
[4] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
[5] "Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17] ."
[6] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[18] or SiO2 [19] ,[20] ,[21] are most widely used."
[7] "The good catalytic performance of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta in the reaction is well explained [26] , and the deactivation mechanism is finally discussed."
[8] "Very high propylene production rate of 4.11 , with high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1, can be achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[9] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation."
[10] "On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include high energy consumption, production of heavy waste, and the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing new catalysts with optimized compositions and reaction parameters. They aim to improve catalyst activity to better utilize precious metals like platinum and reduce costs. The deactivation mechanisms of existing catalysts, like the migration of Pt species during PDH reactions, are being studied. High-surface-area supports with abundant hydroxyl groups, such as Al2O3 and SiO2, are used to disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species. The performance of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst is optimized to achieve a high propylene production rate of 4.11 with a high selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h1 at 823 K. The deactivation is not primarily due to coke deposition but rather to the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species during high-temperature PDH reactions.

工业丙烯生产中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战包括高能耗、产生大量废物，以及在考虑热力学限制的同时，需要具有高温稳定性、高丙烯选择性和抗副反应的催化剂。研究人员通过开发具有优化组成和反应参数的新催化剂来应对这些挑战。他们旨在提高催化剂活性，更好地利用铂等贵金属并降低成本。研究现有催化剂的失活机制，如PDH反应中纳米级铂物种的迁移。使用富含羟基的高比表面积支持物，如Al2O3和SiO2，以分散和稳定铂基双组分物种。通过对Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂的性能进行优化，以实现823 K下4.11的高丙烯产率、98%的高选择性以及可持续的0.02 h1的失活率。催化失活的主要原因不是焦炭沉积，而是高温PDH反应中锌物种的损失和随后铂物种的聚集。
