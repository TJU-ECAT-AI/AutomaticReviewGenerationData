[1] "Propylene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates [1] , is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
[2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes [2] ,[3] ,[4] ."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."
[4] "More importantly, the availability of abundant shale gas containing light alkanes makes PDH more attracting in terms of the economy and environment."
[5] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications [7] ,[8] ."
[6] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] ."
[7] "Zn, a highly abundant and non-toxic metal, has been explored as a promising modifier of Pt for PDH, but receives much less attention than the post-transition-metals Ga [6] ,[10] and Sn [11] ,[12] ."
[8] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15] ,[16] , it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."
[9] "Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17] ."
[10] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[18] or SiO2 [19] ,[20] ,[21] are most widely used."
[11] "In view of the known activity of Pt and Pt-Zn in PDH and the contribution of Si-Beta support from the so-called confinement effect, we herein report the design and construction of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts for PDH."
[12] "High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process."
[13] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 with an acceptable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, while a specific activity value of 2.54 with a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h1 is achieved in the presence of H2."
[14] "These results are comparable with the best results reported for Pt-based catalysts in PDH (Fig. 5 d & Table S2 )."
[15] "The simple preparation route and the low-cost feature will further contribute to the advantages to 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst for future application."

1. Industrial propylene production through steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil faces challenges such as high energy consumption and waste production. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative route with economic and environmental benefits, especially given the abundance of natural gas containing light alkanes.
2. Challenges in PDH include managing metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation, particularly during reaction and regeneration processes. Introducing a second metal species with strong interaction can enhance Pt species' activity and stability in PDH reactions.
3. Zinc, despite its potential as a modifier of Pt in PDH, receives less attention than other metals like gallium and tin. Its ability to improve catalytic performance and reduce coke formation during PDH is promising but requires stabilization of Pt species under high-temperature conditions.
4. The migration of subnanometer Pt species during PDH reaction impacts the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalysts rather than coke formation, highlighting the importance of stabilizing Pt species.
5. High-surface-area supports with abundant hydroxyl groups, such as alumina and silica, are commonly used to disperse Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH.
6. The Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst design combines the activity of Pt and Zn in PDH with the confinement effect of Si-Beta support, leading to a robust, low-cost catalyst suitable for industrial PDH processes.
7. The 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst achieves high propylene production rates and stability, with specific activities of 4.11 and 2.54 in the absence and presence of hydrogen, respectively.
8. The 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst's performance is competitive with the best results reported for Pt-based catalysts in PDH, demonstrating its potential for future applications.
