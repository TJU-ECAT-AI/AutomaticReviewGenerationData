<p>In this context, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9] , Pt-Ga [6] ,[10] , Pt-Cu [1] , Pt-Sn [11] ,[12] ,[13] , and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6] . For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] . Zn, a highly abundant and non-toxic metal, has been explored as a promising modifier of Pt for PDH, but receives much less attention than the post-transition-metals Ga [6] ,[10] and Sn [11] ,[12] . Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15] ,[16] , it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels).</p>
<p>Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17] . To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[18] or SiO2 [19] ,[20] ,[21] are most widely used.</p>
<p>In view of the known activity of Pt and Pt-Zn in PDH and the contribution of Si-Beta support from the so-called confinement effect, we herein report the design and construction of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts for PDH. High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process. We subsequently present detailed analyses on the roles of Si-Beta support, active Pt species and Zn modifier in PDH reaction. The good catalytic performance of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta in the reaction is well explained [26] , and the deactivation mechanism is finally discussed.</p>

<p>More importantly, the availability of abundant shale gas containing light alkanes makes PDH more attracting in terms of the economy and environment.</p>

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include high energy consumption, production of heavy waste, and the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, high propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing new catalysts with optimized compositions and reaction parameters. They aim to improve catalyst activity to better utilize precious metals like platinum and reduce costs. The deactivation mechanisms of existing catalysts, like the migration of Pt species during PDH reactions, are being studied. High-surface-area supports with abundant hydroxyl groups, such as Al2O3 and SiO2, are used to disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species. The performance of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst is optimized to achieve a high propylene production rate of 4.11 with a high selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h1 at 823 K. The deactivation is not primarily due to coke deposition but rather to the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species during high-temperature PDH reactions.
