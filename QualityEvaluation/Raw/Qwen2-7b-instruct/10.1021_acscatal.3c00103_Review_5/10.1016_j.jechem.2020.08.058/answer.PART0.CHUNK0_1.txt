<p>More importantly, the availability of abundant shale gas containing light alkanes makes PDH more attracting in terms of the economy and environment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications.</p>
<p>The introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction.</p>
<p>High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process.</p>
<p>The good performance as well as the low-cost and easily-scalable properties makes 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta a promising PDH catalyst for future applications.</p>
<p>Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst.</p>

1. The primary challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts that can withstand high temperatures, maintain high propylene selectivity, resist side reactions, and operate efficiently within thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing bimetallic catalysts that combine metals with strong interaction to enhance activity and stability. 

2. Opportunities in PDH research focus on creating catalysts with robust stability, high propylene selectivity, low coke deposition, and cost-effectiveness. By stabilizing Pt and Zn on zeolite supports, researchers aim to create catalysts that perform well at reasonable reaction temperatures, offering a promising solution for industrial PDH processes.

3. The deactivation of PDH catalysts is influenced by factors beyond coke deposition. The loss of Zn species and the aggregation of Pt species during high-temperature reactions are identified as the main causes for irreversible deactivation. This understanding allows for targeted improvements in catalyst design to mitigate these issues.

1. PDH工业丙烯生产的首要挑战包括催化剂需要耐受高温、保持高丙烯选择性、抵抗副反应，并在热力学限制内高效运行。研究者通过结合具有强相互作用的金属来增强活性和稳定性，以应对这些需求。

2. PDH研究的机会集中在创建具有强大稳定性的催化剂、高丙烯选择性、低焦炭沉积以及成本效益高的催化剂上。通过将Pt和Zn稳定在沸石支撑上，研究人员旨在在合理反应温度下创造性能良好的催化剂，为工业PDH过程提供有前景的解决方案。

3. 催化剂失活的机制不仅仅是焦炭沉积。在高温反应中，Zn物种的损失和Pt物种的聚集被确认为主要导致不可逆失活的原因。这一理解允许对催化剂设计进行针对性改进，以减轻这些问题。
