The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include achieving high-temperature stability, maintaining high propylene selectivity, and resisting side reactions while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing catalysts that incorporate promoters to regulate active sites, using encapsulation techniques to control size and adjust sites, employing hydroxyl anchoring to anchor active sites effectively, and modifying supports to improve stability. However, challenges remain, such as the economic viability of using excessive promoters, the complexity of hydroxyl anchoring processes, the cost and complexity of encapsulation, and the need for more accessible and efficient synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites.
