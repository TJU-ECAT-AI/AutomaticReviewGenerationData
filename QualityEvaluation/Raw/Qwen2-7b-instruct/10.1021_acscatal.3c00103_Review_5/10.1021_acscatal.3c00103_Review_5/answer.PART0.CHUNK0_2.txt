The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are related to the thermodynamic limitations of the PDH reaction, which can lead to high temperatures and subsequent side reactions. These side reactions and high temperatures cause challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to sintering and coke deposition. Researchers address these needs by exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity. They introduce promoters, encapsulate active sites, and utilize different morphologies of supports to decrease diffusion restrictions. Mesoporous zeolites are considered as potential supports due to their lower diffusion limitation compared to microporous zeolites. Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports combines the catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites to alleviate diffusion limitations.

工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战与PDH反应的热力学限制有关，这可能导致高温和随后的一系列副反应。这些副反应和高温对催化剂的高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抗结块性提出了挑战。研究人员通过探索具有高稳定性和丙烯选择性的催化剂来应对这些需求。他们引入促进剂、封装活性位点，并利用不同形态的支持体以减少异相催化体系中的扩散限制。由于其较低的扩散限制，介孔沸石被视为PDH反应的潜在支持体。构建分级沸石作为PDH支持体结合了传统微孔沸石和介孔沸石的催化性质，有效地缓解了扩散限制。
