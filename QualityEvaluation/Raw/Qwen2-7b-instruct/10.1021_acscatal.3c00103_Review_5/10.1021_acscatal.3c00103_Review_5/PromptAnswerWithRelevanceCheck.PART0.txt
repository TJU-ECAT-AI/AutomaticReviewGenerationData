4. Conclusion and Outlook
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts.

Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts. In this review, we have briefly introduced reasons for sintering and coke formation and how they impact catalytic stability. Small-sized particles with high surface energy tend to agglomerate into large particles during the PDH process, causing rapid deactivation, while coke generated from side reactions under high temperatures can deposit on the active sites, inhibiting the contact of reactants.

Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability. Though great progress has been made, there are still challenges remaining to be solved, including...

(1) Adding promoters is one of the most efficient strategies in active site regulation to inhibit sintering and coke deposition. Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical. Meantime, for metal oxide-based catalytic systems, the introduction of inappropriate oxides may suppress the intrinsic activity of active compounds. Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent.

(2) The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites. At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC. However, the complicated processes for the fabrication of supports with uniform organic groups and expensive TMPs make it difficult to apply in practical production.

(3) Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation. At the present stage, controllably encapsulating metal or metal oxide clusters into a zeolite matrix can be achieved through the ligand-protected direct synthesis route, making full use of the cooperation effect among organic groups. However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex.

(4) For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems. Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production. Mesoporous zeolites can serve as potential supports for PDH reaction due to their lower diffusion limitation compared to microporous zeolites. The amorphous structure of mesoporous zeolites induces low hydrothermal stability and weak interactions for the fixation of active components. Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites. Currently, the methods of synthesizing hierarchical zeolites can be classified into two sorts: top-down and bottom-up methods. The former, which are post-treatment processes, including dealumnization, desiliconization, and recrystallization, can induce low hydrothermal stability and poor repeatability, while the latter, which utilize porogens in the synthesis process, need expensive templates and complicated synthesis routes that are uneconomical. Therefore, there is still a long way to explore facile templates and simplify the synthesis process.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production involve achieving high-temperature stability, maintaining high propylene selectivity, and preventing side reactions. Researchers address these challenges by developing catalysts with superior antisintering and anticoke abilities. Key strategies include:

1. Promoters: They are crucial for inhibiting sintering and coke deposition, but require careful consideration to avoid suppressing the intrinsic activity of active compounds. The goal is to understand the specific effects and functional mechanisms of promoters and find cheaper alternatives.

2. Hydroxyl anchoring: This method can effectively anchor active sites, but the complex fabrication processes for supports with uniform organic groups and the expense of TMPs hinder practical application.

3. Encapsulation: It offers benefits in controlling size, adjusting sites, and spatial segmentation. However, the selection of proper ligands for different supports and metals makes the technique complex and costly.

4. Different morphologies of supports: Using supports with larger outer surfaces can decrease diffusion restrictions, but rare templates are often needed, complicating industrial application. Mesoporous zeolites serve as viable alternatives due to their lower diffusion limitations, although their amorphous structure reduces hydrothermal stability and weakens interactions with active components.

To overcome these challenges, researchers aim to develop more cost-effective, universally applicable strategies for catalyst design, focusing on improving the efficiency and stability of PDH processes.

工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢（PDH）的主要挑战包括在高温下实现稳定性、保持高丙烯选择性和防止副反应。研究人员通过开发具有抗聚集和抗结焦能力的催化剂来解决这些问题。关键策略包括：

1. 添加促进剂：它们对于抑制聚集和结焦至关重要，但需要仔细考虑以避免抑制活性成分的内在活性。目标是理解促进剂的具体作用和功能机制，并寻找更便宜的选择。

2. 氢氧基锚定：这种方法可以有效地固定活性位点，但复杂的制备过程支持均匀有机组分以及TMP的高昂成本阻碍了实际应用。

3. 封装：它提供了控制尺寸、调整位点和空间分割的优势。然而，为不同的支持和金属选择适当的配体使该技术复杂且成本高昂。

4. 不同形态的支持物：使用具有更大外表面的支持物可以减少异质催化系统的扩散限制，但往往需要稀有模板，这阻碍了工业应用。介孔沸石作为PDH反应的潜在支持物，由于其较低的扩散限制而具有可行性，尽管其非晶结构降低了水热稳定性和活性成分的结合力。

为了克服这些挑战，研究人员致力于开发更经济、通用的催化剂设计策略，专注于提高PDH过程的效率和稳定性。
