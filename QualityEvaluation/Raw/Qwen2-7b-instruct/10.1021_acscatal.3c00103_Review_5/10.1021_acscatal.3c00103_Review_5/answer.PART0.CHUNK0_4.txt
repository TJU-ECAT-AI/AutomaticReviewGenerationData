Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production faces several challenges, primarily related to high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers address these needs by developing catalysts with high stability, focusing on mitigating issues such as sintering and coke deposition. Strategies like adding promoters, employing hydroxyl anchoring, and using encapsulation aim to regulate active sites, enhance stability, and adjust the spatial distribution of catalysts. Utilizing different morphologies of supports, particularly mesoporous zeolites, helps reduce diffusion restrictions. These approaches collectively aim to improve catalyst efficiency and economic viability in industrial propylene production.
