4. Conclusion and Outlook
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts. Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production.
