[1] "The main aspects of the new reaction of direct (one-stage) propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN) are analyzed with reference to the development of the catalysts for this reaction, the main technological options for the process and relationship with reaction conditions, the reaction network and kinetics of the reaction."
[2] "Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology."
[3] "Survey of the Development of Catalyst and Process There are two main technological options for the conversion of propane to ACN: i) a two stage process based on a first dehydrogenation step of propane to propylene integrated to a second conventional unit for propylene to ACN or ii) a direct (one- stage) propane conversion to ACN."
[4] "Role of Reaction Conditions and Relationship with Process Options Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbitals in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction temperatures around 500-55oC; these temperatures are about lOO-15oC higher than those required for propylene ammoxidation."
[5] "Reaction Network AS discussed above, V-Sb-Al mixed oxides currently represent the most promising candidate catalysts for the development of direct ACN synthesis from propane as feedstock."
[6] "In the second case, furthermore, the type of reactor (stainless steel instead of quartz and higher dead volume) enhances the importance of the reaction of NH3 side conversion to Ng."
[7] "Kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature discusses the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through detailed examination of catalyst properties and their impact on the reaction mechanism. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity, as it prevents the unwanted formation of byproducts by controlling the reaction pathways. The reaction mechanism involves C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, highlighting the importance of catalyst design and selection. The role of site isolation is pivotal in addressing selectivity issues by optimizing the reaction environment and ensuring the formation of desired products.
