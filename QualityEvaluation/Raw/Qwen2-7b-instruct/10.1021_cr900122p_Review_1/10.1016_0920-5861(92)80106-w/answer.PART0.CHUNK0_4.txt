[1] "Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology."
[2] "Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocar- bons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbit& in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction tempera- tures around 500-55oC; these temperatures are about lOO-15oC higher than those requi- red for propylene ammoxidation."
[3] "These catalysts are selective to acryloni- trile mainly using high propane and ammonia concentrations and results suggest that they catalyze the step from propylene to acrylonitrile, whereas the first step from propane to propylene occurs in the homogeneous gas phase."
[4] "It should be noted, however,that the selectivity to ACN is influenced by the competitive reac- tions of propylene transformation to ACN and to CO,; the former rate depends considerably on the relative rate of the parallel ammonia oxida- tion to N2."
[5] "In the second case, furthermore, the type of reactor (stainless steel instead of quartz and higher dead volu- me) enhances the importance of the reaction of NH3 side conversion to Ng."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights the interplay between various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the need for effective C-H bond activation, management of M-alkyl intermediates, and prevention of 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

High selectivity and conversion are influenced by reaction conditions, particularly temperature and the type of reactor used. Catalysts like vanadium antimonates are promising for propane ammoxidation, offering high activity and selectivity for acrylonitrile formation. The literature emphasizes the importance of ammonia consumption, noting its higher demand in propane ammoxidation compared to propylene ammoxidation due to increased reaction temperatures and contact times. This leads to a reduction in effective ammonia availability on the catalyst surface, impacting the selectivity to acrylonitrile.

In reactor conditions, the type of material and dead volume impact the side conversion of ammonia to nitrogen. Stainless steel reactors, with higher dead volumes, exacerbate this issue, leading to lower selectivities towards acrylonitrile. Kinetic analysis reveals that the formation of acrylonitrile from propylene is a rate-limiting step, influencing the overall process efficiency. The literature suggests that further improvement in catalyst performance could lead to higher yields and selectivities, potentially through the use of co-catalysts and optimized reactor design.

The process efficiency is collectively influenced by the choice of catalyst, reaction conditions, and reactor design. Achieving high selectivity and conversion requires careful management of these factors to minimize unwanted side reactions and maximize the formation of acrylonitrile from propane.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，文献强调了各种催化剂（包括块体金属氧化物和支持体系）之间的相互作用。实现高选择性和转化的挑战包括有效的C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的管理以及2H-抽象的预防。通过隔离反应位点来解决选择性问题至关重要，以减少副产品的形成。

高选择性和转化受到反应条件的影响，特别是温度和所用反应器的类型。例如，基于范德蒙-抗坏血酸的混合氧化物是丙烯氧化氮合成中很有前景的催化剂系统，能提供高活性和选择性的丙烯酰胺形成。文献强调了氨消耗的重要性，在丙烯氧化氮合成中与丙烯氧化氮合成相比，由于更高的反应温度和接触时间导致氨消耗增加，这导致催化剂表面有效氨量的减少，影响丙烯酰胺的选择性。

在反应器条件下，材料类型和死体积影响氨向氮的侧转化。使用不锈钢反应器，具有更高死体积，加剧这一问题，导致较低的丙烯酰胺选择性。动力学分析揭示了丙烯转化为丙烯酰胺是决定步骤，影响整体过程效率。文献建议进一步改进催化剂性能可以提高产量和选择性，可能通过共催化剂和优化反应器设计。

过程效率受催化剂选择、反应条件和反应器设计的共同影响。实现高选择性和转化需要仔细管理这些因素，以最小化副反应并最大化从丙烷到丙烯酰胺的转化。
