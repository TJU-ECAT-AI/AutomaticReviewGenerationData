[1] "Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology."
[2] "Survey of the Development of Catalyst and Process There are two main technological options for the conversion of propane to ACN: i) a two stage process based on a first dehydrogenation step of propane to propylene integrated to a second conventional unit for propylene to ACN or ii) a direct (one- stage) propane conversion to ACN."
[3] "Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocar- bons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbit& in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction tempera- tures around 500-55oC; these temperatures are about lOO-15oC higher than those requi- red for propylene ammoxidation."
[4] "It can be estimated that in one-stage propane ammoxidation the production cost of ACN is around 15-208 lower than that resulting from the addition of a propane dehydro genation unit to an existing propylene ammoxidation plant."
[5] "Various catalysts employed were mainly conventional propylene to ACN catalysts such as USb- or MoCe-mixed oxides, but good activities were obtained only at high temperatures (around 55OC) and mainly in the 0920-5661/92/$05.66 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers"
[6] "Based on the patented results, V-antimonate systems appear to be the more active/selective in acrylonitrile formation."
[7] "It is shown that i) V-Al-antimonate based mixed oxides are promising catalytic systems for the selective formation ofACN from propane in the absence ofgas-phase additives, ii) ACN forms through the intermediate formation of propylene and the factor controlling the selectivity to ACN is the rate of the reaction for the formation of ACN from the intermediate propylene (rate which critically depends on the availability of ammonia on the catalyst surface), and iii) kinetic and economic analyses suggest the use of a process involving a high propane concentration with 02 and NH3 as limiting reagents to recycle unreacted propane."
[8] "Results in differential conditions of the dependence of the rates of formation of propylene (Ca=),acrylonitrile (ACN), acetonitrile (AcCN), HCN and cracking products (Cg) on propane, 02 or NH3 concentrations (in the O-20% range) indicate that the rates of formation of these products can be described, according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, on the basis of two different sites for propane and for 02 and NH3 adsorption (competition between these two reagents on the same site) with a rate determining step involving the reaction between adsorbed propane, 02 and NHs."
[9] "Maximum yield, around 35-4096,in ACN can be obtained for a propane conversion of about 60-80%."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves multiple catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, aiming to efficiently convert alkanes into more valuable products while maintaining high selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges in achieving high selectivity often stem from competing reactions and the difficulty in activating C-H bonds without unwanted side reactions. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which collectively influence process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing the interaction between competing reaction pathways, thereby enhancing the desired product formation.

The use of various catalysts, particularly V-Al-antimonate mixed oxides, is highlighted for their promise in selectively forming acrylonitrile (ACN) from propane without the need for gas-phase additives. The rate-determining step in ACN formation from propylene is influenced by the availability of ammonia on the catalyst surface. Kinetic analysis reveals that the formation of ACN from propylene is the rate-limiting step in the process, affecting overall selectivity. Economic considerations favor a process involving a high propane concentration with oxygen and ammonia as limiting reagents for recycling unreacted propane.

In differential conditions, the rates of formation of propylene, ACN, and other products depend on propane, oxygen, and ammonia concentrations, indicating a complex interplay between reactants. Kinetic studies suggest that maximum yields of ACN, around 35-40%, are achieved with a propane conversion of about 60-80%. These findings underscore the potential of developing a new process from propane, but they also highlight the need for further improvement in catalyst performance to enhance the propylene to ACN conversion rate and selectivity.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，旨在高效地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品，同时保持高选择性和转化率。实现高选择性时遇到的主要挑战是竞争反应的存在和难以激活C-H键而避免副反应。所提出的反应机制包括C-H键激活、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H抽象，这些共同影响了过程效率。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过最小化竞争反应途径之间的相互作用，从而增强所需产物的形成。

特别提到的催化剂，尤其是V-Al-锑酸盐混合氧化物，因其在不使用气体相添加剂的情况下选择性形成丙烯腈（ACN）的潜力而受到关注。从丙烯形成ACN的关键步骤受催化剂表面氨的可用性的影响。动力学分析表明，从丙烯形成ACN是过程中的限速步骤，影响总体选择性。

在差分条件下，丙烯、氧气和氨浓度决定了丙烯、ACN和其他产品的形成速率，表明反应物之间存在复杂的相互作用。动力学研究表明，当丙烷转化率为约60-80%时，最大产率可达约35-40%，此时ACN的产率最高。这些发现强调了开发新的丙烷过程的潜力，但也指出了进一步改进催化剂性能以提高丙烯到ACN的转换率和选择性的必要性。
