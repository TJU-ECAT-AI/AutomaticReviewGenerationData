[1] "Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology."
[2] "Even though the first option is already commercially available, the relative expensive cost of the dehydrogenation unit for propane limits interest in this solution, whereas the one-stage propane conversion to ACN appears more attractive."
[3] "Various patents were published in the 1970-1975 [ll, principally by Monsanto Co., on the process of acrylonitrile synthesis from propane. The catalysts employed were mainly conventional propylene to ACN catalysts such as USb- or MoCe-mixed oxides, but good activities were obtained only at high temperatures (around 55OC) and mainly in the 0920-5661/92/$05.66 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers"
[4] "It can be estimated that in one-stage propane ammoxidation the production cost of ACN is around 15-208 lower than that resulting from the addition of a propane dehydro genation unit to an existing propylene ammoxidation plant."
[5] "In recent years a large number of patents, mainly from BP/Sohio have been tiled on new classes of catalysts not requiring the presence of gas-phase additives [2,3]. The patented catalysts are mainly based on two catalytic systems, U V-antimonate with a r-utile structure [21 and ii1 Bi-V-molybdate with a sheelite structure [31."
[6] "Based on the patented results, V-antimonate systems appear to be the more active/selective in acrylonitrile formation."
[7] "Indeed, BP/Sohio have announced tehir intended commercialization of the propane process in few years [4].Nothwithstanding the interesting industrial outlooks, relatively few data exist on the characterization of catalysts for propane ammoxidation as well as on reaction kinetics and mechanisms."
[8] "Role of Reaction Conditions and Relationship with Process Options Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocar- bons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbit& in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction tempera- tures around 500-55oC; these temperatures are about lOO-15oC higher than those requi- red for propylene ammoxidation."
[9] "This means that recourse to this option requires a recycling of unreacted propane which, in turn, implies the use of 02 instead of air and a complete conversion of Ox and of NHs."
[10] "In both these options therefore low oxygen to propane ratios (lower than 1.0) are required."
[11] "The higher rate of parallel oxidation of NH3 not only influences the variable cost of the process, but also results in a reduction of effective availability of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst for ACN synthesis with a drastic reduction in selectivity to ACN."
[12] "In the second case, furthermore, the type of reactor (stainless steel inste- ad of quartz and higher dead volu- me) enhances the importance of the reaction of NH3 side conversion to Ng."
[13] "It is clearly evident that in the second case (Fig. 2) much lower se- lectivities to ACN are obtained, whe- reas selectivity to propylene is much less a&cted."
[14] "In conclusion, kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves considering the interaction between various catalyst types, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the need for efficient C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the process of 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by dictating the pathway of the reaction and the rates at which different steps occur. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that specific reaction pathways are favored over others. For instance, in the context of propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN), the use of V-antimonate-based mixed oxides is promising for selective ACN formation under certain conditions. The role of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants, is pivotal in optimizing the process. Additionally, the economic advantage of using propane as a feedstock, which costs about 5-6 times less than propylene, makes the one-stage propane conversion to ACN a more attractive option compared to a two-stage process involving propane dehydrogenation. The use of different catalysts, such as UV-antimonate and Bi-V-molybdate, has been patented for improved selectivity and activity in ACN formation. Kinetic analysis reveals that the formation of ACN primarily proceeds through the intermediate formation of propylene, highlighting the importance of enhancing the rate of propylene to ACN transformation to improve selectivity. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH processes are multifaceted, encompassing the selection of appropriate catalysts, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the management of side reactions to ensure efficient and economically viable processes.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及到考虑各种催化剂类型之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括有效地C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H摘除过程。这些因素共同影响了过程效率，决定了反应路径和不同步骤的速率。站点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过确保特定反应途径优先于其他途径。例如，在丙烯氨氧化制丙烯腈（ACN）的背景下，基于V-锑酸盐的混合氧化物对在某些条件下选择性ACN形成具有前景。反应条件的作用，如温度、压力和反应物的比例，在优化过程中至关重要。此外，使用成本约为丙烯5至6倍的丙烷作为原料，使得一阶段丙烷转化为ACN相对于包含丙烷脱氢单元的现有丙烯氨氧化装置的成本更低，因此成为更具吸引力的选择。不同催化剂，如UV-锑酸盐和Bi-V-钼酸盐，已被专利授权用于提高ACN形成的活性和选择性。动力学分析揭示了ACN主要通过丙烯中间体的形成来形成，强调了增强丙烯到ACN转换速率以提高选择性的必要性。ODH过程中实现高选择性和转化率的挑战是多方面的，涉及合适的催化剂选择、反应条件优化和副反应管理，以确保高效和经济可行的过程。
