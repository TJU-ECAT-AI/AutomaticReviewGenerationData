GBASSEU?) and Ferruccio TBIFIRO Dept. ofIndustrial Chemistry and Materials, V.le Risorgimento 4,40136 Bologna, Italy @ax:-39-51-644-3654) ; #Dept. of Chem., Georgetown Univ., Washington, DC 20057, USA Abstract The main aspects of the new reaction of direct (one-stage) propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN) are analyzed with reference to the development of the catalysts for this reaction, the main technological options for the process and relationship with reaction conditions, the reaction network and kinetics of the reaction. In particular it is shown that i) V-Al-antimonate based mixed oxides are promising catalytic systems for the selective formation ofACN from propane in the absence ofgas-phase additives, ii) ACN forms through the intermediate formation of propylene and the factor controlling the selectivity to ACN is the rate of the reaction for the formation of ACN from the intermediate propylene (rate which critically depends on the availability of ammonia on the catalyst surface), and iii) kinetic and economic analyses suggest the use of a process involving a high propane concentration with 02 and NH3 as limiting reagents to recycle unreacted propane.
Introduction Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology. The cost of propane feedstock is about 5-6 times less than the cost of propylene and thus the development of a process based on propane as the main material appears to be the more direct evolution of the propylene ammoxidation process: CHa-CH2-CH3
+ NH3 + 202 + CH2=CHCN + 4 H20
(AH = -151 kcal/mol) (1) Survey of the Development of Catalyst and Process There are two main technological options for the conversion of propane to ACN: i) a two stage process based on a first dehydrogenation step of propane to propylene integrated to a second conventional unit for propylene to ACN or ii) a direct (one- stage) propane conversion to ACN. Even though the first option is already commercially available, the relative expensive cost of the dehydrogenation unit for propane limits interest in this solution, whereas the one-stage propane conversion to ACN appears more attractive. In fact, it can be estimated that in one-stage propane ammoxidation the production cost of ACN is around 15-208 lower than that resulting from the addition of a propane dehydro genation unit to an existing propylene ammoxidation plant.Various patents were published in the 1970-1975 [ll, principally by Monsanto Co., on the process of acrylonitrile synthesis from propane. The catalysts employed were mainly conventional propylene to ACN catalysts such as USb- or MoCe-mixed oxides, but good activities were obtained only at high temperatures (around 55OC) and mainly in the 0920-5661/92/$05.66 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers

0.4%. These gas-phase additives were introduced to enhance the rate of the propane to
propylene step by creating radical species active in H-abstraction from partinic C-H bonds.
The presence of these additives, the related problems of material resistance as well as the severe reaction conditions limited the profitability of the process and it was not further developed on a commercial scale.
In recent years a large number of patents, mainly from BP/Sohio have been tiled on new classes of catalysts not requiring the presence of gas-phase additives [2,3]. The patented catalysts are mainly based on two catalytic systems, U V-antimonate with a r-utile structure [21 and ii1 Bi-V-molybdate with a sheelite structure [31. Based on the patented results, V-antimonate systems appear to be the more active/selective in acrylonitrile formation. It can be estimated that notwithstanding the higher total fixed investment (around lo-15% higher for an equivalent size plant for propylene ammoxidation) required by the process,due to the more severe reaction conditions and lower productivity in the propane ammoxi- dation process with respect to the propylene process, the raw material cost advantage largely compensates this additional cost, thus resulting in a lower transfer price for the propane process. Indeed, BP/Sohio have announced tehir intended commercialization of the propane process in few years [4].Nothwithstanding the interesting industrial outlooks, relatively few data exist on the characterization of catalysts for propane ammoxidation as well as on reaction kinetics and mechanisms. Four main catalytic systems have been investigated for this reaction:ij Ga-antimonates (pure or modified with W, Ni and P) have been studied mainly by Osipova and Sokolovski [5] and show several structural and reactivity analogies to the V-antimonate based system. The best performances of Ga- antimonate occurs when the Sb/Ga ratio on the surface is around 1[5cl, but with an excess of Sb in the bulk of the catalyst. ii) Bi-V-molybdate based catalysts have been studied by Moro-oka et al. [6] and similar compositions have been patented by BP/Sohio [3]. These catalysts are selective to acryloni- trile mainly using high propane and ammonia concentrations and results suggest that they catalyze the step from propylene to acrylonitrile, whereas the first step from propane to propylene occurs in the homogeneous gas phase. Similar conclusions have been indicated by Minow et al. [7] based on studies of propane ammoxidation on supported Bi-molybdate catalysts. iii1 Vanadyl pyrophosphate, the active phase for the commercial process of butane conver- sion to maleic anhydride, has also been tested for propane ammoxidation 181 as well as patented in the past [9], but the results were not so promising. iv) Finally, the activity of V-antimonate catalysts, patented in the past also by ICI [lOI, was reported for propane ammoxidation [8al about the same time as the appearence of the various patents from BP/Sohio [2]; however the reported selectivities were lower.In addition to these systems, the activities of V-,Mo-,Bi-Mo supported mixed oxides modified with various additives [7] and of V-silicalite and V-aluminophosphate catalysts [ill have also been reported for the reaction of propane to acrylonitrile, but low selectivities were found. Various other catalytic systems, such as MoPBiOx/AlgOs, NiCrOz/AlzOs, SnWOx/SiC, AgCd, BiPMoO heteropolyacids, FeBiO,, SnMoB9,, SnTQ, SbTiOx, MC+ SbOz/AlxOs are also cited in the various patents.Role of Reaction Conditions and Relationship with Process Options Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocar- bons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbit& in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction tempera- tures around 500-55oC; these temperatures are about lOO-15oC higher than those requi- 663 red for propylene ammoxidation. Furthermore, contact times around 4-6 times longer (in the range of 2-10 set) are necessary to obtain high conversions. The productivity of the catalyst therefore is much lower which explains why the fixed cost investment is higher in the propane process as compared to the propylene process. For this reason, it is useful to develop a process from propane utilizing high hydrocarbon concentrations in order to increase the productivity. However, the choice of the reagent composition is limited by the presence of an explosion region in the ternary diagram of the reagents (propane-02 or air-NHs) . The lower explosion limit corresponds to a propane concentration below about 1% vol, whereas the upper limit corresponds to propane concentrations higher than about 10% vol. Higher productivities than those possible when operating below the lower explosion limit (usual conditions for hydrocarbon selective oxidation) thus require operating either inside the explosion limits or above the upper explosion limit. Reagent compositions reported in the patents [2,31 are for both composition ranges, but especially for the former option (propane concentration around 6%). The first option (operating inside the explosion region) may be technically possible in the case of complete oxygen conversion in the outlet stream and using a fluidized bed reactor, but operation inside the explosion limits is always very critical. The second option is more reasonable, but in order to remain outside the explosion region, the propane conversion must be maintained relatively low, generally below 50%. This means that recourse to this option requires a recycling of unreacted propane which, in turn, implies the use of 02 instead of air and a complete conversion of Ox and of NHs. In both these options therefore low oxygen to propane ratios (lower than 1.0) are required.Ammonia consumption in the propane process is higher than in the propylene ammoxi- dation process, because, due to higher contact times and reaction temperatures, the rate of the parallel reaction of ammonia oxidation to Ng is higher; therefore a larger fraction of NH3 is not utilized for the selective insertion in acrylonitrile molecules, thus resulting in a higher cost of the process. The higher rate of parallel oxidation of NH3 not only influences the variable cost of the process, but also results in a reduction of effective availability of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst for ACN synthesis with a drastic reduction in selectivity to ACN. The control of this parallel reaction on ammonia is thus of critical importance for the development of the process, and taking into account that this parallel reaction on NHs occurs both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phases, optimization of both reactor technology and catalyst is required.Finally, a very critical aspect in the development of the process is related to the control of the heat of reaction. As compared to the propylene process, the lower selectivity to ACN (higher formation ofcarbon oxides), the higher rate ofparallelNH3 oxidation, and the higher reaction temperature and contact times make very critical the control of reaction tempera- tures which may be the limiting factor for the development of a process using high propane concentrations. The use of suitable reactor options, such as a fluidixed-bed reactor, with an efficient removal of the heat of reaction is thus very important for process development.Reaction Network AS discussed above, V-Sb-Al mixed oxides currently represent the most promising candidate catalysts for the development of direct ACN synthesis from propane as feedstock.Thus in this section attention is focused on results obtained regarding the reaction network and reaction kinetics 1121 on a V-Sb-Al-O catalyst promoted with W, whose composition and method of preparation are analogous to those reported for the best patented catalysts [23 and also found optimal by us [121.The V:Sb:W atomic ratio is 1:5:1 and the composition of the catalyst is 30% wt of active component assumed as VSbO*+2SbxO4+WOs.

At low conversion (shor- ter contact times) the primary re- action product is propylene which progressively decreases with a parallel increase in ACN selecti- vity. For the longer contact times (higher propane conv.) the conse- cutive conversion to carbon oxides of both propylene and ACN oc- curs. These results evidence two important aspects of this reac- tion:i) A very selective activation of propane to propylene occurs (se- lectivities higher than 80%1,whe- reas direct ACN synthesis from propane is of secondaryimportan- ce. ACN forms mainly from the intermediate propylene, but the contemporaneous presence of pro- pylene and ACN is observed over the entire range of propane conversion. This indicates that the rate of propylene to ACN transformation is relatively slow as compared to the rate of propane to propylene transfor- mation. A co-catalyst or suitable doping of a V-Sb-Al-O catalyst to improve the rate of propylene to ACN transformation can therefore considerably improve the selectivity to
ACN.
ii) Selectivities to ACN of about 60% can be obtained for propane conversions around 40-5095; at higher propane conversion the consecutive oxidation to carbon oxides becomes critical. It is thUB necessary to limit this reaction and in this sense low 02 to propane ratios in the feedstock (oxygen as the limiting reagent) are preferable. On the other hand, in order to have high selectivities as well as to limit the heat release due to the formation of carbon oxides, low propane conversion must be considered.

It should be noted, however,that the selectivity to ACN is in- fluenced by the competitive reac- tions of propylene transformation to ACN and to CO,; the former rate depends considerably on the relative rate of the parallel ammonia oxida- tion to N2. This reaction occurs in both the homogeneous and he- terogeneous gas phase and thus depends on the type of reactor (dead volume and type of mate- rial) and on the reaction tempe- 666 6 -weslg.h

rature (at the lower reaction tempe ratures longer contact times are re quired to obtain the same conversion and thus the relative importance of the homogeneous side reaction of ammonia oxidation is greater). This is shown in the comparison of the results obtained at high Wig. 1) and low (Fig. 2) reaction temperatures.
In the second case, furthermore, the type of reactor (stainless steel inste- ad of quartz and higher dead volu- me) enhances the importance of the reaction of NH3 side conversion to Ng. It is clearly evident that in the second case (Fig. 2) much lower se- lectivities to ACN are obtained, whe- reas selectivity to propylene is much less a&cted. In general, however,lower global selectivities (propylene + ACN) are also obtained.
Kinetics of the Reaction The kinetic analysis of propane ammoxidation to ACN on a V-Sb-Al-0 catalyst was carried out in both differential and integral tubular flow reactor conditions [D&l. Results in differential conditions of the dependence of the rates of formation of propylene (Ca=),acrylonitrile (ACN), acetonitrile (AcCN), HCN and cracking products (Cg) on propane, 02 or NH3 concentrations (in the O-20% range) indicate that the rates of formation of these products can be described, according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, on the basis of two different sites for propane and for 02 and NH3 adsorption (competition between these two reagents on the same site) with a rate determining step involving the reaction between adsorbed propane, 02 and NHs. Using this model it is possible to describe the dependence of the rate offormation of products on NH3 concentration, which, in particular for propylene,shows the presence of a self-inhibition effect (presence of a maximum in the rate of urouvlene 35 30 25 20

formation). Reported in Fig. 3:s the dependence of the rates of formation of propylene and ACN on NH3 con- centration which clearly shows this effect as well as the higher rate of propylene formation with respect to ACN formation in these conditions (low conversion). The symbols in Fig. 3 represent experimental data and the lines drawn in the figure were calculated from the kinetic model.

Exp. conditions as in Fig. 1.
Catalytic tests were also carried out in integral reactor conditions, in order to obtain information on the rate of the consecutive reactions. Re- ported in Rig. 4 is, for example, the dependence of the yield of products on the space-velocity; also in this case the symbols refer to experimen- 666 tal data, and lines to calculated values from the kinetic studies. It is shown that maximum yield, around 35-4096,in ACN can be obtained for a propane conversion of about 60-80%.
For higher conversion, the yield to ACN decreases due to consecutive reactions.
In conclusion, kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene. Maximum yields and selectivities of ACN obtained were in the 35-40% and 5060% range, for propane conversions around 4050% and 60-80%, respectively. These data alone illustrate the value of the development of the new process from propane, but also indicate that considerable further improvment in catalyst performance may still be possible. Kinetic analysis, in fact, suggests future work in the area of co-catalysts to enhance the propylene to ACN conversion and the use of higher propane/(&+NHal ratios with propane recycling and 02 rather than air as the source of feed oxygen.
