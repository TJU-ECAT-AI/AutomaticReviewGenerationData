[1] "Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology."
[2] "Survey of the Development of Catalyst and Process There are two main technological options for the conversion of propane to ACN: i) a two stage process based on a first dehydrogenation step of propane to propylene integrated to a second conventional unit for propylene to ACN or ii) a direct (one- stage) propane conversion to ACN."
[3] "Role of Reaction Conditions and Relationship with Process Options Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocar- bons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbit& in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction tempera- tures around 500-55oC; these temperatures are about lOO-15oC higher than those requi- red for propylene ammoxidation."
[4] "Reaction Network AS discussed above, V-Sb-Al mixed oxides currently represent the most promising candidate catalysts for the development of direct ACN synthesis from propane as feedstock."
[5] "It should be noted, however,that the selectivity to ACN is in- fluenced by the competitive reac- tions of propylene transformation to ACN and to CO,; the former rate depends considerably on the relative rate of the parallel ammonia oxida- tion to N2."
[6] "Kinetics of the Reaction The kinetic analysis of propane ammoxidation to ACN on a V-Sb-Al-0 catalyst was carried out in both differential and integral tubular flow reactor conditions [D&l."
[7] "In conclusion, kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene."
[8] "Maximum yields and selectivities of ACN obtained were in the 35-40% and 5060% range, for propane conversions around 4050% and 60-80%, respectively."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems plays a crucial role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in achieving these goals are primarily rooted in the complex chemistry involved, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction processes. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by determining the pathways of reaction and the rates at which these pathways occur.

Site isolation, particularly in the context of the mentioned study, refers to the ability of a catalyst to selectively activate certain sites for specific reactions, thereby enhancing the selectivity and conversion rates. In the case of propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile, the V-Sb-Al mixed oxides are highlighted as promising catalysts due to their ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene and subsequently into acrylonitrile.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH are multifaceted. They involve balancing the competing reactions, such as the transformation of propylene into acrylonitrile versus its further oxidation to carbon oxides. The rate of these competing reactions is influenced by factors such as the relative rate of parallel ammonia oxidation to nitrogen (N2), which can significantly impact the selectivity to acrylonitrile.

The kinetic analysis of the process reveals that the formation of acrylonitrile predominantly follows the path of propylene formation, indicating that the rate-limiting step is the conversion of propylene to acrylonitrile. This understanding highlights the importance of optimizing catalysts to enhance the rate of propylene to acrylonitrile conversion.

The efficiency of the process is further influenced by the reactor conditions, such as space velocity, which affects the yield of products. For instance, maximum yields of acrylonitrile were observed around 35-40% for propane conversions of approximately 60-80%. Higher conversions resulted in a decrease in acrylonitrile yield due to consecutive reactions.

These findings underscore the potential for improvement in catalyst performance and the optimization of process parameters to achieve higher selectivity and conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Future work might focus on developing co-catalysts to enhance the propylene to acrylonitrile conversion and exploring higher propane/amine ratios with propane recycling and the use of oxygen instead of air as the source of feed oxygen.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）时，不同催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）之间的相互作用对实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。在实现这些目标方面遇到的主要挑战在于复杂的化学反应过程，包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-摘除过程。这些因素共同影响了过程效率，决定了反应途径和反应速率。

站点隔离，尤其是在提到的研究中，指的是催化剂能够选择性地激活特定站点进行特定反应的能力，从而提高选择性和转化率。在丙烯氨氧化合成乙腈的过程中，V-Sb-Al复合氧化物被指出是具有前景的催化剂，因为它们能够有效地将丙烯转化为丙烯并随后转化为乙腈。

在ODH过程中遇到的挑战主要涉及平衡竞争反应，如丙烯转化为乙腈与进一步氧化为碳氧化物之间的反应。这些竞争反应的速率受到诸如平行氨氧化到氮（N2）的速率等因素的影响，这显著影响了乙腈的选择性。

动力学分析揭示了乙腈形成的主路径通过丙烯的形成，表明限制步骤是丙烯转化为乙腈的速率相比丙烯中间体的形成更为缓慢。这一理解强调了优化催化剂以增强丙烯至乙腈转换速率的重要性。

过程效率还受反应器条件的影响，例如空间速度，这会影响产物的产率。例如，大约在60-80%的丙烷转化率下观察到了乙腈的最大产率约在35-40%。更高的转化率导致了乙腈产率的下降，这是由于连续反应的结果。

这些发现突出了改进催化剂性能和优化工艺参数以实现烷烃氧化脱氢更高选择性和转化率的潜力。未来的工作可能集中在开发共催化剂以增强丙烯至乙腈的转换，并探索更高的丙烷/胺比例，利用丙烷循环和氧气而非空气作为氧气来源。
