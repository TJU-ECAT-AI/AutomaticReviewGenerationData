[1] "Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology."
[2] "Even though the first option is already commercially available, the relative expensive cost of the dehydrogenation unit for propane limits interest in this solution, whereas the one-stage propane conversion to ACN appears more attractive."
[3] "Various patents were published in the 1970-1975 [ll, principally by Monsanto Co., on the process of acrylonitrile synthesis from propane. The catalysts employed were mainly conventional propylene to ACN catalysts such as USb- or MoCe-mixed oxides, but good activities were obtained only at high temperatures (around 55OC) and mainly in the 0920-5661/92/$05.66 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers"
[4] "It can be estimated that in one-stage propane ammoxidation the production cost of ACN is around 15-208 lower than that resulting from the addition of a propane dehydro genation unit to an existing propylene ammoxidation plant."
[5] "In recent years a large number of patents, mainly from BP/Sohio have been tiled on new classes of catalysts not requiring the presence of gas-phase additives [2,3]. The patented catalysts are mainly based on two catalytic systems, U V-antimonate with a r-utile structure [21 and ii1 Bi-V-molybdate with a sheelite structure [31."
[6] "Based on the patented results, V-antimonate systems appear to be the more active/selective in acrylonitrile formation."
[7] "Indeed, BP/Sohio have announced tehir intended commercialization of the propane process in few years [4].Nothwithstanding the interesting industrial outlooks, relatively few data exist on the characterization of catalysts for propane ammoxidation as well as on reaction kinetics and mechanisms."
[8] "Role of Reaction Conditions and Relationship with Process Options Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocar- bons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbit& in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction tempera- tures around 500-55oC; these temperatures are about lOO-15oC higher than those requi- red for propylene ammoxidation."
[9] "This means that recourse to this option requires a recycling of unreacted propane which, in turn, implies the use of 02 instead of air and a complete conversion of Ox and of NHs."
[10] "In both these options therefore low oxygen to propane ratios (lower than 1.0) are required."
[11] "The higher rate of parallel oxidation of NH3 not only influences the variable cost of the process, but also results in a reduction of effective availability of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst for ACN synthesis with a drastic reduction in selectivity to ACN."
[12] "In the second case, furthermore, the type of reactor (stainless steel inste- ad of quartz and higher dead volu- me) enhances the importance of the reaction of NH3 side conversion to Ng."
[13] "It is clearly evident that in the second case (Fig. 2) much lower se- lectivities to ACN are obtained, whe- reas selectivity to propylene is much less a&cted."
[14] "In conclusion, kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves considering the interaction between various catalyst types, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the need for efficient C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the process of 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by dictating the pathway of the reaction and the rates at which different steps occur. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that specific reaction pathways are favored over others. For instance, in the context of propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN), the use of V-antimonate-based mixed oxides is promising for selective ACN formation under certain conditions. The role of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants, is pivotal in optimizing the process. Additionally, the economic advantage of using propane as a feedstock, which costs about 5-6 times less than propylene, makes the one-stage propane conversion to ACN a more attractive option compared to a two-stage process involving propane dehydrogenation. The use of different catalysts, such as UV-antimonate and Bi-V-molybdate, has been patented for improved selectivity and activity in ACN formation. Kinetic analysis reveals that the formation of ACN primarily proceeds through the intermediate formation of propylene, highlighting the importance of enhancing the rate of propylene to ACN transformation to improve selectivity. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH processes are multifaceted, encompassing the selection of appropriate catalysts, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the management of side reactions to ensure efficient and economically viable processes.

[9] "Maximum yield, around 35-4096,in ACN can be obtained for a propane conversion of about 60-80%."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves multiple catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, aiming to efficiently convert alkanes into more valuable products while maintaining high selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges in achieving high selectivity often stem from competing reactions and the difficulty in activating C-H bonds without unwanted side reactions. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which collectively influence process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing the interaction between competing reaction pathways, thereby enhancing the desired product formation.

The use of various catalysts, particularly V-Al-antimonate mixed oxides, is highlighted for their promise in selectively forming acrylonitrile (ACN) from propane without the need for gas-phase additives. The rate-determining step in ACN formation from propylene is influenced by the availability of ammonia on the catalyst surface. Kinetic analysis reveals that the formation of ACN from propylene is the rate-limiting step in the process, affecting overall selectivity. Economic considerations favor a process involving a high propane concentration with oxygen and ammonia as limiting reagents for recycling unreacted propane.

In differential conditions, the rates of formation of propylene, ACN, and other products depend on propane, oxygen, and ammonia concentrations, indicating a complex interplay between reactants. Kinetic studies suggest that maximum yields of ACN, around 35-40%, are achieved with a propane conversion of about 60-80%. These findings underscore the potential of developing a new process from propane, but they also highlight the need for further improvement in catalyst performance to enhance the propylene to ACN conversion rate and selectivity.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems plays a crucial role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in achieving these goals are primarily rooted in the complex chemistry involved, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction processes. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by determining the pathways of reaction and the rates at which these pathways occur.

Site isolation, particularly in the context of the mentioned study, refers to the ability of a catalyst to selectively activate certain sites for specific reactions, thereby enhancing the selectivity and conversion rates. In the case of propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile, the V-Sb-Al mixed oxides are highlighted as promising catalysts due to their ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene and subsequently into acrylonitrile.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH are multifaceted. They involve balancing the competing reactions, such as the transformation of propylene into acrylonitrile versus its further oxidation to carbon oxides. The rate of these competing reactions is influenced by factors such as the relative rate of parallel ammonia oxidation to nitrogen (N2), which can significantly impact the selectivity to acrylonitrile.

The kinetic analysis of the process reveals that the formation of acrylonitrile predominantly follows the path of propylene formation, indicating that the rate-limiting step is the conversion of propylene to acrylonitrile. This understanding highlights the importance of optimizing catalysts to enhance the rate of propylene to acrylonitrile conversion.

The efficiency of the process is further influenced by the reactor conditions, such as space velocity, which affects the yield of products. For instance, maximum yields of acrylonitrile were observed around 35-40% for propane conversions of approximately 60-80%. Higher conversions resulted in a decrease in acrylonitrile yield due to consecutive reactions.

These findings underscore the potential for improvement in catalyst performance and the optimization of process parameters to achieve higher selectivity and conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Future work might focus on developing co-catalysts to enhance the propylene to acrylonitrile conversion and exploring higher propane/amine ratios with propane recycling and the use of oxygen instead of air as the source of feed oxygen.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）时，不同催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）之间的相互作用对实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。在实现这些目标方面遇到的主要挑战在于复杂的化学反应过程，包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-摘除过程。这些因素共同影响了过程效率，决定了反应途径和反应速率。

站点隔离，尤其是在提到的研究中，指的是催化剂能够选择性地激活特定站点进行特定反应的能力，从而提高选择性和转化率。在丙烯氨氧化合成乙腈的过程中，V-Sb-Al复合氧化物被指出是具有前景的催化剂，因为它们能够有效地将丙烯转化为丙烯并随后转化为乙腈。

在ODH过程中遇到的挑战主要涉及平衡竞争反应，如丙烯转化为乙腈与进一步氧化为碳氧化物之间的反应。这些竞争反应的速率受到诸如平行氨氧化到氮（N2）的速率等因素的影响，这显著影响了乙腈的选择性。

动力学分析揭示了乙腈形成的主路径通过丙烯的形成，表明限制步骤是丙烯转化为乙腈的速率相比丙烯中间体的形成更为缓慢。这一理解强调了优化催化剂以增强丙烯至乙腈转换速率的重要性。

过程效率还受反应器条件的影响，例如空间速度，这会影响产物的产率。例如，大约在60-80%的丙烷转化率下观察到了乙腈的最大产率约在35-40%。更高的转化率导致了乙腈产率的下降，这是由于连续反应的结果。

这些发现突出了改进催化剂性能和优化工艺参数以实现烷烃氧化脱氢更高选择性和转化率的潜力。未来的工作可能集中在开发共催化剂以增强丙烯至乙腈的转换，并探索更高的丙烷/胺比例，利用丙烷循环和氧气而非空气作为氧气来源。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights the interplay between various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the need for effective C-H bond activation, management of M-alkyl intermediates, and prevention of 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

High selectivity and conversion are influenced by reaction conditions, particularly temperature and the type of reactor used. Catalysts like vanadium antimonates are promising for propane ammoxidation, offering high activity and selectivity for acrylonitrile formation. The literature emphasizes the importance of ammonia consumption, noting its higher demand in propane ammoxidation compared to propylene ammoxidation due to increased reaction temperatures and contact times. This leads to a reduction in effective ammonia availability on the catalyst surface, impacting the selectivity to acrylonitrile.

In reactor conditions, the type of material and dead volume impact the side conversion of ammonia to nitrogen. Stainless steel reactors, with higher dead volumes, exacerbate this issue, leading to lower selectivities towards acrylonitrile. Kinetic analysis reveals that the formation of acrylonitrile from propylene is a rate-limiting step, influencing the overall process efficiency. The literature suggests that further improvement in catalyst performance could lead to higher yields and selectivities, potentially through the use of co-catalysts and optimized reactor design.

The process efficiency is collectively influenced by the choice of catalyst, reaction conditions, and reactor design. Achieving high selectivity and conversion requires careful management of these factors to minimize unwanted side reactions and maximize the formation of acrylonitrile from propane.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，文献强调了各种催化剂（包括块体金属氧化物和支持体系）之间的相互作用。实现高选择性和转化的挑战包括有效的C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的管理以及2H-抽象的预防。通过隔离反应位点来解决选择性问题至关重要，以减少副产品的形成。

高选择性和转化受到反应条件的影响，特别是温度和所用反应器的类型。例如，基于范德蒙-抗坏血酸的混合氧化物是丙烯氧化氮合成中很有前景的催化剂系统，能提供高活性和选择性的丙烯酰胺形成。文献强调了氨消耗的重要性，在丙烯氧化氮合成中与丙烯氧化氮合成相比，由于更高的反应温度和接触时间导致氨消耗增加，这导致催化剂表面有效氨量的减少，影响丙烯酰胺的选择性。

在反应器条件下，材料类型和死体积影响氨向氮的侧转化。使用不锈钢反应器，具有更高死体积，加剧这一问题，导致较低的丙烯酰胺选择性。动力学分析揭示了丙烯转化为丙烯酰胺是决定步骤，影响整体过程效率。文献建议进一步改进催化剂性能可以提高产量和选择性，可能通过共催化剂和优化反应器设计。

过程效率受催化剂选择、反应条件和反应器设计的共同影响。实现高选择性和转化需要仔细管理这些因素，以最小化副反应并最大化从丙烷到丙烯酰胺的转化。
