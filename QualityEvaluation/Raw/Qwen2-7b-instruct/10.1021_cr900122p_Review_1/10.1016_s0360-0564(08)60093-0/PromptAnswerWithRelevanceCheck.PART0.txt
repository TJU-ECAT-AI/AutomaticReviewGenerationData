1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a process that converts saturated hydrocarbons into unsaturated products, typically alkenes or aromatics. It relies on various catalysts, including supported metal oxides and bulk metal oxides, each offering unique properties suited for different alkane types and desired products. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from potential side reactions like hydrogen abstraction, which can produce undesired byproducts. Key mechanisms in ODH often involve the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms. These factors collectively shape the process efficiency by influencing reactivity, selectivity, and the formation of desired products.

2. Site isolation is essential in ODH for enhancing selectivity. By controlling the spatial arrangement of reactants and intermediates, it guides the reaction pathways, directing the process towards the formation of targeted products rather than unwanted byproducts. This approach ensures that the catalysts are optimally utilized, maximizing the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
