[1] "The presence of surface-generated gas-phase radicals is now well established for many catalytic decomposition and oxidation reactions."
[2] "The radicals generally are observed at reaction temperatures in excess of 4WC, and in some cases temperatures of approximately 800C are required."
[3] "The surface-generated radicals may be significant as (1) initiators of chain reactions, (2) intermediates in gas-phase coupling reactions, (3) a means for the transport of intermediates from one surface to another, (4) experimental evidence for a radical mechanism, and (5) a means of determining the rate-limiting step of a catalytic cycle."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors. The key catalysts involved include bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the difficulty in controlling the reaction pathways, particularly in activating C-H bonds, forming M-alkyl intermediates, and performing 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of ODH processes depends on these factors working together effectively. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the alkyl radicals do not react with gas-phase molecular oxygen, thus preserving the integrity of the desired products.

氧化脱氢烷基化（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响。参与的关键催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统。在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临的挑战通常源自控制反应路径的难度，特别是激活C-H键、形成M-烷基中间体和进行2H摘除。ODH过程的效率取决于这些因素有效地协同工作。通过确保烷基自由基不与气相分子氧反应，位点隔离在解决选择性问题中扮演着关键角色，从而保持所需产品的完整性。
