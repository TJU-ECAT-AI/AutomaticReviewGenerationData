Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, the literature reveals that various catalysts, particularly bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play significant roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are common due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the interplay between different catalyst components. The proposed reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, contribute to the process efficiency. Site isolation techniques might be employed to address selectivity issues by controlling the reactivity of different catalyst sites.

The literature highlights that propene is the most abundant primary product, followed by CO and CO2 formation through secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. The uniformity in reaction rates across different catalyst systems suggests a similarity in the active centers present on these surfaces. The Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism is proposed to explain the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane, leading to propene production and subsequent recombination of OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. Reduced Mo centers reoxidize through irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. The reversibility of OH group recombination is another key feature. Additionally, the rapid exchange of lattice oxygens in the MoOx active phase and the ZrO2 support indicates efficient utilization of oxygen in the reactions at 688 K.

These findings collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, providing insights into optimizing catalyst design and improving process efficiency. Site isolation strategies could potentially enhance selectivity by segregating active sites and controlling reaction pathways.

对烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）进行了分析，文献表明各种催化剂，尤其是块状金属氧化物和支持系统，在该过程中扮演着重要角色。由于反应路径的复杂性和不同催化剂组件之间的互动，实现高选择性和转化率的挑战普遍存在。提出的反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-提取，有助于提高过程效率。通过隔离位点技术可能可以解决选择性问题，通过控制不同催化剂位点的活性。

文献指出，丙烯是最重要的初级产物，随后通过丙烯的次级燃烧或直接燃烧丙烷形成CO和CO2。不同催化剂系统的反应速率的一致性表明这些表面存在相似的活性中心。火星-范克雷伦还原序列被提出以解释丙烷中不可逆的C-H键活化，导致丙烯的产生和随后的OH团的再组合形成水和还原Mo中心。还原的Mo中心通过不可逆的氧解离吸附的O2重新氧化。OH团的再组合具有可逆性是另一个关键特征。此外，在688 K时MoOx活性相和ZrO2支持中的氧离子快速交换表明在反应中有效利用氧气。

这些发现共同加深了对氧化脱氢过程的理解，提供了优化催化剂设计和提高过程效率的见解。通过隔离位点策略可能可以增强选择性，通过分离活性位点并控制反应途径。
