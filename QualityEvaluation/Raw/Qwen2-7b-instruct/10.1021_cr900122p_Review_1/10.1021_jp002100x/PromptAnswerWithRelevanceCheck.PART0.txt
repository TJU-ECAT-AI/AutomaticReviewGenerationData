Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, particularly propane, reveals the complexities in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the process. Challenges such as maintaining high selectivity while maximizing conversion often require a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms.

Catalyst types, such as molybdenum oxide (MoOx) supported on zirconia (ZrO2), molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) supported on ZrO2, and zirconium-molybdenum oxide (ZrMo2O8) supported on ZrO2, exhibit similar reactivity patterns, suggesting that they possess similar active sites. These catalysts facilitate the parallel and sequential oxidation steps required for ODH, where propene emerges as the primary product alongside CO and CO2 generated through propene combustion or direct propane combustion.

The reaction kinetics are consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, highlighting the pivotal role of lattice oxygen atoms in activating C-H bonds within the alkane molecules. This activation process is irreversible, leading to the formation of alkyl species that subsequently desorb as propene. Meanwhile, the remaining OH groups recombine to produce water and reduced molybdenum centers, which then reoxidize through the irreversible dissociative chemisorption of oxygen.

The reversibility of the recombination of OH groups to form water underscores the dynamic nature of surface chemistry during the ODH process. Assuming that surface oxygen and hydroxyl (OH) groups are the most prevalent intermediates aids in formulating rate expressions that accurately capture the kinetics of propane ODH reactions. Isotopic tracer studies further validate the assumptions underlying the reaction mechanisms, providing a comprehensive understanding of how reactant and product concentrations impact the rate of ODH.

In summary, the efficient management of the oxidative dehydrogenation process relies on the strategic selection of catalysts, the understanding of reaction mechanisms, and the optimization of reaction conditions. Site isolation techniques could potentially address selectivity issues by controlling the reaction environment and promoting the desired pathways, thereby enhancing the overall process efficiency.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，特别是丙烷的ODH，揭示了在保持高选择性和最大化转化率之间取得平衡的复杂性。不同类型的催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和负载系统，对于提高过程效率至关重要。

摩尔氧化物（MoOx）负载在氧化锆（ZrO2）上的催化剂、三氧化钼（MoO3）负载在ZrO2上的催化剂以及锆钼氧化物（ZrMo2O8）负载在ZrO2上的催化剂，在反应速率对丙烷、氧气和水浓度的依赖性上表现出相似性，这表明它们具有类似的活性位点。这些催化剂通过并联和串联氧化步骤促进烷烃的氧化脱氢，其中丙烯作为主要产物出现，而CO和CO2则通过丙烯燃烧或直接丙烷燃烧形成。

与烷烃分子中的C-H键激活相关的反应动力学符合Mars-van Krevelen还原氧化序列，强调了在烷烃中激活C-H键的晶格氧原子的关键作用。此激活过程是不可逆的，导致生成的烷基物种随后以丙烯的形式脱附。同时，剩余的OH组分重新组合产生水和还原的钼中心，然后通过不可逆的氧解离化学吸附进行再氧化。

OH组分重新组合以形成水的可逆性进一步体现了表面化学在ODH过程中动态性的特征。假设表面氧和羟基（OH）组分是最丰富的中间体有助于制定准确描述丙烷ODH反应动力学的速率表达式。同位素示踪研究进一步验证了反应机制背后的假设，提供了全面理解反应物和产物浓度如何影响ODH速率的见解。

综上所述，高效管理ODH过程依赖于催化剂的选择、反应机制的理解和反应条件的优化。隔离位点技术可能通过控制反应环境并促进所需路径来解决选择性问题，从而增强整体过程效率。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, the literature reveals that various catalysts, particularly bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play significant roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are common due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the interplay between different catalyst components. The proposed reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, contribute to the process efficiency. Site isolation techniques might be employed to address selectivity issues by controlling the reactivity of different catalyst sites.

The literature highlights that propene is the most abundant primary product, followed by CO and CO2 formation through secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. The uniformity in reaction rates across different catalyst systems suggests a similarity in the active centers present on these surfaces. The Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism is proposed to explain the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane, leading to propene production and subsequent recombination of OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. Reduced Mo centers reoxidize through irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. The reversibility of OH group recombination is another key feature. Additionally, the rapid exchange of lattice oxygens in the MoOx active phase and the ZrO2 support indicates efficient utilization of oxygen in the reactions at 688 K.

These findings collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, providing insights into optimizing catalyst design and improving process efficiency. Site isolation strategies could potentially enhance selectivity by segregating active sites and controlling reaction pathways.

对烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）进行了分析，文献表明各种催化剂，尤其是块状金属氧化物和支持系统，在该过程中扮演着重要角色。由于反应路径的复杂性和不同催化剂组件之间的互动，实现高选择性和转化率的挑战普遍存在。提出的反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-提取，有助于提高过程效率。通过隔离位点技术可能可以解决选择性问题，通过控制不同催化剂位点的活性。

文献指出，丙烯是最重要的初级产物，随后通过丙烯的次级燃烧或直接燃烧丙烷形成CO和CO2。不同催化剂系统的反应速率的一致性表明这些表面存在相似的活性中心。火星-范克雷伦还原序列被提出以解释丙烷中不可逆的C-H键活化，导致丙烯的产生和随后的OH团的再组合形成水和还原Mo中心。还原的Mo中心通过不可逆的氧解离吸附的O2重新氧化。OH团的再组合具有可逆性是另一个关键特征。此外，在688 K时MoOx活性相和ZrO2支持中的氧离子快速交换表明在反应中有效利用氧气。

这些发现共同加深了对氧化脱氢过程的理解，提供了优化催化剂设计和提高过程效率的见解。通过隔离位点策略可能可以增强选择性，通过分离活性位点并控制反应途径。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) reveals several key points. Catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in the efficiency of this process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complex interplay of reaction mechanisms and the specific properties of the catalyst surfaces. For instance, the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, involving lattice oxygen atoms, facilitates the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane. This process leads to the formation of propene, with CO and CO2 produced through secondary and direct combustion. Site isolation on the catalyst surface ensures that similar active centers are present across different materials, contributing to uniform reaction kinetics. The recombination of OH groups to form water is identified as a reversible step, while the reoxidation of Mo centers by O2 is considered irreversible. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, highlighting the importance of surface chemistry and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.
