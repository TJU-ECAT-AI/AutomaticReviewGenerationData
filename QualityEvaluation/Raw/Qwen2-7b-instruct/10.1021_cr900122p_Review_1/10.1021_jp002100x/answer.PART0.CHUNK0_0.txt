Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in the process include optimizing catalyst performance for efficient reactions, particularly in addressing selectivity issues. The proposed reaction mechanisms highlight the importance of C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps in driving the ODH process. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by confining the active sites, thereby improving the efficiency of the reactions. The collective influence of these factors on process efficiency is significant, as it directly impacts the yield of desired products and reduces the formation of unwanted byproducts. The role of lattice oxygen atoms in participating in the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane underscores the mechanism's complexity and the intricate nature of the reactions involved.
