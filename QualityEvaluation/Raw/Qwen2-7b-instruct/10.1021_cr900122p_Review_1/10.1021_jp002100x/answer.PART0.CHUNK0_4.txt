[1] "Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify the elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts."
[2] "Propene is the most abundant primary product, and that CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene, or by direct combustion of propane."
[3] "A mixture of C3H8 and C3D8 undergoes oxidative dehydrogenation without forming C3H8-xDx mixed isotopomers, suggesting that steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible."
[4] "Normal kinetic isotopic effects (kC-H/kC-D) were measured for propane dehydrogenation (2.3), propane combustion (1.6) and propene combustion (2.1)."
[5] "HD exchange occurs readily between C3H6 and D2O or C3D6 and H2O, suggesting that OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated."
[6] "Lattice oxygen is required for CH bond activation and for the ultimate oxidation of the adsorbed products of this reaction."
[7] "These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism in which two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bond in propane."
[8] "The proposed reaction mechanism leads to a complex kinetic rate expression that accurately describes the observed dependences on the partial pressure of propane, oxygen, and water."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in process efficiency stem from the need for selective activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining reactive species to specific areas on the catalyst surface. The Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, involving lattice oxygen atoms, is proposed to explain the irreversible activation of C-H bonds, leading to propene production and subsequent recombination of OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. This mechanism, along with the kinetic rate expression, accurately describes the reaction kinetics influenced by the partial pressures of propane, oxygen, and water.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），文献讨论了各种催化剂（包括单质金属氧化物和支持系统）之间的相互作用，以实现高选择性和转化。过程效率的挑战源于对C-H键的选择性活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H抽取的需求。通过隔离反应位点，可以解决选择性问题，将活性物种限制在催化剂表面的特定区域。Mars-van Krevelen还原氧化机制被提出，以解释C-H键的不可逆活化，导致丙烯生成，并随后OH团的重组形成水和还原的Mo中心。该机制连同动力学速率表达式，准确地描述了受丙烷、氧气和水分压影响的反应动力学。
