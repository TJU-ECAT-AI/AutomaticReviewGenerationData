Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) reveals several key points. Catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in the efficiency of this process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complex interplay of reaction mechanisms and the specific properties of the catalyst surfaces. For instance, the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, involving lattice oxygen atoms, facilitates the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane. This process leads to the formation of propene, with CO and CO2 produced through secondary and direct combustion. Site isolation on the catalyst surface ensures that similar active centers are present across different materials, contributing to uniform reaction kinetics. The recombination of OH groups to form water is identified as a reversible step, while the reoxidation of Mo centers by O2 is considered irreversible. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, highlighting the importance of surface chemistry and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，揭示了几点关键信息。包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统在内的催化剂在这一过程中的效率至关重要。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战往往源于反应机制的复杂性及其对催化剂表面的特定属性。例如，Mars-van Krevelen还原氧化机制，涉及到晶格氧原子，促进了丙烷中C-H键的不可逆活化。这一过程导致了丙烯的形成，同时CO和CO2通过次级和直接燃烧产生。催化剂表面上的位点隔离确保了不同材料上存在类似的活性中心，从而促进均匀的反应动力学。OH组的重新组合形成水被认为是可逆步骤，而Mo中心的重新氧化由O2进行则被认为是不可逆的。这些因素共同影响了过程的效率，强调了表面化学和位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的重要性。
