[1] "Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature."
[2] "The Mo surface densities for all MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo contents below 11 wt % MoO3 are below this monolayer capacity"
[3] "The incorporation of cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Y3+, La3+, Ce4+, W6+, and V5+, into ZrO2 inhibits the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2 and the conversion of tetragonal ZrO2 to the monoclinic phase."
[4] "The Mo surface densities on ZrO2 was varied over a wide range (0.3550 Mo/nm2) by changing the Mo content (144 wt % MoO3) and the treatment temperature (393973 K)."
[5] "For samples with low Mo concentrations (11 wt %), neither Raman spectroscopy nor X-ray diffraction detected bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures because the MoOx surface density of these samples remained well below the monolayer value of 5 Mo/nm2 at all treatment temperatures."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes (ODH) relies on the use of catalysts, particularly bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to achieve high selectivity and conversion. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by preventing unwanted side reactions. Catalysts with optimized surface densities, such as those of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) supported on zirconia (ZrO2), show significant dependence on the MoOx surface density for both rate and selectivity. The surface density of MoOx on ZrO2 can be manipulated by adjusting the Mo content and treatment temperature, affecting the structure of the catalyst and thus the efficiency of the ODH process.

The surface density of MoOx on ZrO2 determines the presence of bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures. Below a monolayer capacity of 5 Mo/nm2, these bulk structures are not detected. The incorporation of certain cations into ZrO2 can inhibit the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2, thereby influencing the catalyst's performance. The treatment temperature affects the structure of the catalyst, leading to different stages of development from isolated tetrahedral MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and eventually to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures. This structural evolution impacts the selectivity and efficiency of the ODH process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）依赖于催化剂，尤其是块状金属氧化物和支持系统，以实现高选择性和转化率。该过程的效率受到诸如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H抽取等因素的影响。站点隔离在增强选择性方面起着关键作用，通过防止不必要的副反应。具有优化表面密度的催化剂，如钼氧化物（MoOx）在氧化锆（ZrO2）上的支持，显示出对摩尔氧化物表面密度的强烈依赖，这直接影响ODH过程的速率和选择性。

MoOx在ZrO2上的表面密度决定了是否存在批量MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2结构。当低于每平方纳米5个Mo的单层容量时，这些批量结构未被检测到。将某些离子引入ZrO2可以抑制无定形ZrOx(OH)4-2x向四面体ZrO2的结晶，从而影响催化剂性能。处理温度影响催化剂结构，导致从孤立的四面体MoOx到二维寡聚体的不同阶段发展，最终形成MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2批量结构。这种结构演变影响ODH过程的选择性和效率。
