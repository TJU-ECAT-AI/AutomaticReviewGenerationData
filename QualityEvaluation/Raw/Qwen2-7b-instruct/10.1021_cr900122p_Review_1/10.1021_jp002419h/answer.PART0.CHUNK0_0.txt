Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), this study demonstrates the critical role of catalysts, especially bulk metal oxides and supported systems, in enhancing process efficiency. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through understanding the detailed evolution of catalyst structures. The key mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by controlling the reaction pathways and preventing unwanted side reactions.

The study reveals that the surface density of the catalysts, particularly molybdenum oxide (MoOx) on zirconia (ZrO2), significantly influences the ODH process. By varying the molybdenum content and treatment temperature, researchers can manipulate the catalyst's structure, leading to optimized selectivity and conversion rates.

The evolution of the catalyst structure from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and eventually to bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures showcases the dynamic nature of the catalytic system. The process is temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures promoting the formation of MoO3 and Zr(MoO4)2 through solid-state reactions. Conversely, lower temperatures favor the formation of MoO3, indicating the importance of temperature control in achieving desired products.

Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are employed to characterize the catalysts, providing insights into the structural changes during synthesis and pretreatment. These techniques reveal that the size of the polymolybdate domains increases with the MoOx surface density, affecting the reaction kinetics and selectivity. The shift in the ν(MoO) Raman band and changes in the near-edge X-ray absorption spectra further confirm the structural transformation.

The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and reaction performance. By carefully controlling the catalyst's composition and processing conditions, it is possible to tailor the catalyst to enhance the efficiency of the ODH process. This includes optimizing the molybdenum surface density to achieve the desired balance between selectivity and conversion.

In summary, the investigation underscores the intricate interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms, and process efficiency in ODH. Through a systematic exploration of the catalyst's properties, researchers can develop strategies to improve selectivity, conversion, and overall performance of the catalytic system.

氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）的热力学可行性促进了对这些反应的氧化物催化剂的广泛评估。最近，丙烷ODH速率和选择性在MoOx/ZrO2催化剂上的表现表明，MoOx表面密度强烈依赖于Mo含量和催化剂处理温度的变化。

从孤立的MoOx到二维寡聚体，最终到MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2的块状结构的演化，取决于Mo表面密度、处理温度和支持材料的活性。ZrO2支持的钼氧化物，其Mo表面密度范围从0.35至50 Mo/nm2，在拉曼光谱、X射线衍射和X射线吸收光谱的分析下被表征，以理解催化剂合成和预处理期间结构的演变。

所有MoOx/ZrO2样品中Mo含量低于11 wt % MoO3时，MoOx表面密度均低于单层容量。随着Mo表面密度的增加，MoOx尺寸增大，导致ν(MoO)拉曼带偏移，近边X射线吸收光谱发生变化，并伴随着紫外可见边缘能量随表面密度增加而降低。

通过热处理，孤立的四面体MoOx通过减少ZrO2表面面积来形成寡聚体，促进结构增长。在较高温度（973 K）下，MoOMo键断裂，形成了四面体形OMoO4物种。

当Mo表面密度超过5 Mo/nm2时，形成晶态MoO3和Zr(MoO4)2。在873 K以下的空气中处理倾向于形成MoO3，而高温促进MoO3与ZrO2之间的固态反应，形成唯一的Zr(MoO4)2。

综上所述，研究揭示了ODH过程中催化剂结构、反应机制与过程效率之间的复杂关系。通过精确控制催化剂的组成和加工条件，可以设计策略以提高选择性和转化率。这包括优化钼表面密度，实现所需的选择性和转化平衡。

简而言之，该研究强调了催化剂结构、反应途径与催化系统整体性能之间的密切联系。通过系统探索催化剂特性，研究人员可以开发策略以增强ODH过程的效率。
