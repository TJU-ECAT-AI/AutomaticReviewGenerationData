<p>The thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes has led to extensive evaluation of oxide catalysts for these reactions. Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature.</p>
<p>Structural evolution of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support.</p>
<p>The Mo surface densities for all MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo contents below 11 wt % MoO3 are below this monolayer capacity.</p>
<p>Treatment in air at temperatures below 873 K leads to the preferential formation of MoO3, while higher temperatures favor the solid-state reaction between MoO3 and ZrO2 to form exclusively Zr(MoO4)2.</p>

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe the importance of catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion presents challenges, especially when dealing with the activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as the interplay between catalysts and reaction conditions. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the reactivity and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface. The interplay between various factors ensures the optimization of the ODH process for enhanced efficiency.
