[1] "Catalytic systems for activating CH and CCl bonds generally use oxygen-containing compounds in the feed because they provide a thermodynamic driving force, as in oxidation of methane to methanol and acetic acid9,10 or concurrent water formation in the oxidative coupling of methane.11 Kinetically limiting oxidation and preventing thermodynamically favorable total combustion is difficult, and even selective bond activation remains a challenge,12,13 therefore the development of more efficient catalysts for complete oxidative destruction of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons remains an area of active research."
[2] "Recent examples in this field include combustion over uranium-oxide catalysts,14 reaction with H2O2 over an iron catalyst,15 and our own publications on the destructive adsorption over lanthanum-based catalysts.1621"
[3] "Lanthanum-based catalysts have also recently been reported to selectively activate hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane.22,23 Previous studies have suggested that the presence of oxygen is critical for activation of both CH and CCl bonds over these catalytic materials, therefore the destructive adsorption reaction is proposed to proceed via an exchange of two chlorine atoms for one oxygen atom.1621 If lattice oxygen is depleted, the reaction stops."
[4] "LaCl3 is an active and stable catalyst for the hydrogenchlorine exchange reaction between CH2Cl2 and CCl4, selectively yielding CHCl3 under oxygen-free conditions."
[5] "To correct for these gas-phase reactions, the results from the catalytic experiments (Figure1) were adjusted by subtracting the results obtained under the same conditions obtained from blank experiments with either quartz pellets or carbon nanofibers (CNFs)."
[6] "The likely reaction steps in the HCl exchange between CCl4 and CH2Cl2 (Reaction1) were evaluated by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process often stem from difficulties in selectively activating C-H bonds while avoiding unwanted reactions like total combustion or producing undesired byproducts. The presence of oxygen in the feed provides a thermodynamic driving force, facilitating selective bond activation, yet its limitation can hinder the reaction's efficiency. 

High activity catalysts, like LaCl3 supported on carbon nanofibers, demonstrate enhanced surface area and improved performance, offering a more efficient alternative to bulk materials. These catalysts enable the selective exchange of hydrogen and chlorine atoms between chlorinated hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of desired products like CHCl3 under oxygen-free conditions. 

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the proposed reaction mechanisms, suggesting that the reaction proceeds through the formation and exchange of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and chlorine species on the catalytic surface. This indicates that site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for controlled reactions and minimizes interference from other chemical pathways. 

Collectively, these factors influence the process efficiency by balancing the need for high conversion rates with the preservation of selectivity, ensuring the production of targeted products while minimizing waste and byproducts. The development of more efficient catalysts, capable of activating both C-H and CCl bonds without requiring oxygen, represents a promising area of research aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of ODH processes.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的分析中，各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，在实现高选择性和转化率方面起着关键作用。这一过程中的挑战通常源于在避免非期望反应如完全燃烧或产生副产品的同时，选择性活化C-H键的困难。氧气在喂料中的存在提供了热力学驱动力，促进了选择性键活化，但其限制可能导致反应效率降低。

活性催化剂，例如在碳纳米纤维上支持的LaCl3，显示出增强的表面积和改进的性能，提供了一种更有效的替代块材料的方案。这些催化剂能够选择性地交换氯化烃之间的氢和氯原子，导致在无氧条件下形成所需产物如CHCl3。 

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示了提议的反应机制，表明反应通过催化表面上吸附较弱的氢和氯物种的形成和交换进行。这表明位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着重要作用，因为它允许控制反应并最小化其他化学途径的干扰。 

这些因素共同影响过程效率，通过平衡高转化率的需求与保持选择性的需要，确保目标产品的生产，同时减少废物和副产品。开发能够激活C-H和CCl键而无需氧气的更高效催化剂，代表了旨在增强ODH过程有效性的有前景的研究领域。
