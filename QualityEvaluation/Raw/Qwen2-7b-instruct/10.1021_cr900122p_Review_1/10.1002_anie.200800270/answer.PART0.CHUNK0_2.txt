[1] "Catalytic systems for activating CH and CCl bonds generally use oxygen-containing compounds in the feed because they provide a thermodynamic driving force, as in oxidation of methane to methanol and acetic acid9,10 or concurrent water formation in the oxidative coupling of methane.11 Kinetically limiting oxidation and preventing thermodynamically favorable total combustion is difficult, and even selective bond activation remains a challenge,12,13 therefore the development of more efficient catalysts for complete oxidative destruction of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons remains an area of active research."
[2] "Lanthanum-based catalysts have also recently been reported to selectively activate hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane.22,23 Previous studies have suggested that the presence of oxygen is critical for activation of both CH and CCl bonds over these catalytic materials, therefore the destructive adsorption reaction is proposed to proceed via an exchange of two chlorine atoms for one oxygen atom.1621 If lattice oxygen is depleted, the reaction stops."
[3] "This catalyst exhibits the highest conversion on a weight basis. Furthermore, on a volume basis (not shown), the CNF-supported catalyst is at least two orders of magnitude more active than the unsupported materials."
[4] "The likely reaction steps in the HCl exchange between CCl4 and CH2Cl2 (Reaction1) were evaluated by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. These calculations suggest that neither CCl4 nor CH2Cl2 is likely to adsorb molecularly on a fully chlorinated ideal surface of LaCl3. However, it is energetically favorable for chloromethanes to split off a Cl atom and donate it to the surface. Although splitting off and donation of an H atom to the surface is calculated to be endothermic, the process can be partially compensated by exothermic chlorination of the resulting hydrocarbon fragment."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it is evident that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from difficulties in kinetically limiting oxidation and preventing total combustion. Selective bond activation remains a challenge, necessitating the development of more efficient catalysts for complete oxidative destruction of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons.

Lanthanum-based catalysts demonstrate selective activation of hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. Previous studies suggest that the presence of oxygen is essential for activating both C-H and CCl bonds over these materials. The reaction proceeds via an exchange of two chlorine atoms for one oxygen atom, highlighting the importance of oxygen in these catalytic materials. If lattice oxygen is depleted, the reaction stops, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining adequate oxygen levels.

Supporting lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) results in catalysts with the highest conversion on a weight basis. Moreover, these CNF-supported catalysts exhibit at least two orders of magnitude greater activity compared to unsupported materials on a volume basis. This indicates that site isolation, achieved through the use of carbon nanofibers, plays a pivotal role in enhancing selectivity and conversion rates.

Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the likely reaction steps involved in the hydrogen-chlorine exchange between CCl4 and CH2Cl2. Neither CCl4 nor CH2Cl2 is likely to adsorb molecularly on a fully chlorinated ideal surface of LaCl3. However, it is energetically favorable for chloromethanes to split off a Cl atom and donate it to the surface. Although splitting off and donating an H atom to the surface is endothermic, the process can be compensated by exothermic chlorination of the resulting hydrocarbon fragment.

The DFT calculations predict that the reaction (Reaction3) is exothermic by 225 kJ/mol, further elucidating the energetics involved in the HCl exchange reaction. This detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms contributes to the development of more efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, addressing the challenges associated with selectivity and conversion.

In conclusion, the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms collectively influence the process efficiency of oxidative dehydrogenation. Site isolation, as demonstrated by supporting catalysts on carbon nanofibers, plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues. The insights gained from density-functional theory calculations provide a foundation for the development of more efficient catalysts for the complete oxidative destruction of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons.

在分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）时，各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，在过程中起着关键作用。实现高选择性和转化的挑战往往源于限制氧化的动态过程以及阻止有利的完全燃烧。选择性键活化仍然是一个难题，需要开发更高效的催化剂来完全氧化破坏烃类和氯化烃。

镧系基催化剂显示出对甲烷和乙烷等烃的选择性激活。先前的研究表明，在这些催化材料中，氧气的存在对于激活C-H和C-Cl键至关重要。反应通过两个氯原子交换一个氧原子进行，强调了氧气在这些催化材料中的重要性。如果晶格氧耗尽，则反应停止，强调了维持适当氧水平的重要性。

在碳纳米纤维（CNF）上支持镧盐氯化物（LaCl3）产生具有最高重量基础转换率的催化剂。此外，这些CNF支持的催化剂在体积基础上比无支撑材料至少高两个数量级的活性。这表明，通过使用碳纳米纤维实现的位点隔离，在提高选择性和转化率方面发挥着关键作用。

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示了CCl4和CH2Cl2之间氢氯交换的可能反应步骤。CCl4和CH2Cl2不太可能在全氯化理想表面的LaCl3上以分子形式吸附。然而，从表面释放一个Cl原子并将其捐赠到表面是能量有利的。尽管从表面释放并捐赠一个H原子到表面是一个吸热过程，但该过程可以通过结果碳氢化合物片段的氯化部分补偿而得到部分补偿。

DFT计算预测反应（反应3）是放热的，225千焦/摩尔，进一步阐明了HCl交换反应的能量关系。这些关于反应机制的详细理解为更高效催化剂的发展提供了基础，以解决与选择性和转化相关的挑战。

综上所述，各种催化剂、实现高选择性和转化的挑战以及提出的反应机制共同影响了烷烃氧化脱氢的过程效率。位点隔离，通过在碳纳米纤维上支撑催化剂，对于解决选择性问题至关重要。从密度泛函理论计算中获得的见解为开发更高效的催化剂提供了基础，用于完全氧化破坏烃类和氯化烃。

结论是，通过各种催化剂、实现高选择性和转化的挑战以及提出的反应机制共同影响了氧化脱氢烷烃的过程效率。位点隔离，通过在碳纳米纤维上支撑催化剂，对于解决选择性问题至关重要。从密度泛函理论计算中获得的见解为开发更高效的催化剂提供了基础，用于完全氧化破坏烃类和氯化烃。
