[1] "Catalytic systems for activating CH and CCl bonds generally use oxygen-containing compounds in the feed because they provide a thermodynamic driving force, as in oxidation of methane to methanol and acetic acid9,10 or concurrent water formation in the oxidative coupling of methane.11 Kinetically limiting oxidation and preventing thermodynamically favorable total combustion is difficult, and even selective bond activation remains a challenge,12,13 therefore the development of more efficient catalysts for complete oxidative destruction of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons remains an area of active research."
[2] "Recent examples in this field include combustion over uranium-oxide catalysts,14 reaction with H2O2 over an iron catalyst,15 and our own publications on the destructive adsorption over lanthanum-based catalysts.16-21"
[3] "Lanthanum-based catalysts have also recently been reported to selectively activate hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane.22,23 Previous studies have suggested that the presence of oxygen is critical for activation of both CH and CCl bonds over these catalytic materials, therefore the destructive adsorption reaction is proposed to proceed via an exchange of two chlorine atoms for one oxygen atom.16-21"
[4] "Herein we report that LaCl3 is an active and stable catalyst for the hydrogen-chlorine exchange reaction between CH2Cl2 and CCl4, selectively yielding CHCl3 under oxygen-free conditions."
[5] "The calculated energies for Reaction2, where H is exchanged for a surface lattice Cl, are high (310-324 kJ mol-1) regardless of the presence or position of any neighboring defects (Cl vacancy or F-center Cl vacancy). This result suggests that gas-phase CHCs, such as CH2Cl2, are unlikely to exchange their H for a Cl atom from the LaCl3 lattice."
[6] "The calculated energy change for Reaction2 is 210 kJ mol-1 at the adsorbed Cl coverage of 0.25 monolayers (ML). Gas-phase CCl4 (Figure 3c) can react with the surface hydride to regenerate the adsorbed Cl species and form gas-phase CHCl3, as shown in Figure 3d. This reaction (Reaction3) is predicted to be exothermic by 225 kJ mol-1."

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
