(1) "To our knowledge, there is only a single report on the catalytic exchange of H and Cl atoms between chlorinated hydrocarbons, namely the reaction of CCl4 with methane to produce CH3Cl over supported Pt catalysts.8 However, as the reported catalysts also degrade due to conversion of their oxide supports into chlorinated compounds, the authors advocate addition of gas-phase oxygen to the feed to remedy the coke formation even though this inevitably leads to the formation of oxidation products and lower selectivity."
(2) "This catalyst exhibits the highest conversion on a weight basis. Furthermore, on a volume basis (not shown), the CNF-supported catalyst is at least two orders of magnitude more active than the unsupported materials."
(3) "It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the reaction proceeds in two separate HCl exchange steps: CH2Cl2 exchanges an H for a surface Cl (Reaction) and then CCl4 exchanges a Cl for a surface H (Reaction)."
(4) "Gas-phase CCl4 (Figure3c) can react with the surface hydride to regenerate the adsorbed Cl species and form gas-phase CHCl3, as shown in Figure3d. This reaction (Reaction3) is predicted to be exothermic by 225kJmol1."

The passage discusses the catalytic hydrogen-chlorine exchange reaction between chlorinated hydrocarbons under oxygen-free conditions. It highlights the use of LaCl3 supported on carbon nanofibers as a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst for converting CCl4 and CH2Cl2 into CHCl3. The document also mentions that the reaction proceeds through the formation of weakly adsorbed H and Cl species on the catalytic surface. Furthermore, the study suggests that the reaction can be divided into two separate HCl exchange steps: CH2Cl2 exchanging an H for a surface Cl, followed by CCl4 exchanging a Cl for a surface H. Lastly, it indicates that the supported catalysts exhibit higher activity than their bulk counterparts, with the CNF-supported catalyst being at least two orders of magnitude more active.

该段落讨论了在无氧气条件下氯化烃之间的催化氢氯交换反应。它强调了在碳纳米纤维上负载的LaCl3作为将CCl4和CH2Cl2转化为CHCl3的高效、选择性和稳定的催化剂的应用。文献还提到，反应通过催化表面上吸附的弱H和Cl物种进行。此外，研究表明，反应可以分为两个独立的HCl交换步骤：CH2Cl2与表面Cl交换一个H，随后CCl4与表面H交换一个Cl。最后，它指出支持型催化剂比其块状对应物具有更高的活性，CNF支持的催化剂的活性至少比未支持的材料高两个数量级。
