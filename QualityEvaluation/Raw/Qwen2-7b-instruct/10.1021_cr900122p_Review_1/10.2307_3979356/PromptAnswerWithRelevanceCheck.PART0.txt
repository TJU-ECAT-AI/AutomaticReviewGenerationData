<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study suggests that a retrovirus that infected primate ancestors, leaving its DNA in their genes, might play a useful role in pregnancy by helping prevent a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting her fetus. Specifically, the protein encoded by this DNA is abundant in placental cells, indicating its potential importance in suppressing the immune response to the fetus.

[1] "Richer and a team of U.S. and Canadian colleagues detail their work in the Sept. 20 ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS."
[2] "In particular, notes Hubble investigator Harvey B. Richer of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, the dwarfs discovered in M4 should help fine-tune predictions about how rapidly these objects cool—a critical factor in attempts to infer the age of the universe from the temperature of white dwarfs."
[3] "Dwarfs start out hot but gradually cool and fade in a highly predictable manner. Indeed, a dwarf cools at such a predictable rate that its surface temperature indicates its age."
[4] "Millions of years ago, a retrovirus infected our primate ancestors, leaving a legacy of its DNA in their genes. That DNA has been passed down to humans."
[5] "However, at least 0.1 percent of the protein in the layer of placental cells that separates the fetus from the mother comes from a known retroviral sequence designated ERV-3."
[6] "A pregnant woman's body regards the fetus as an interloper in some ways, so its natural reaction is to reject it."
[7] "It really invades," Boyd says. "In order for the mother's body to retain the placenta, something has to suppress her immune response to it."
</quotes>

The study by Boyd and his colleagues identifies that the protein encoded by retroviral DNA found in human genomes, specifically ERV-3, is abundant in placental cells. This suggests that the protein plays a crucial role in preventing the mother's immune system from rejecting the fetus. The protein's presence and abundance in placental cells indicate its importance in maintaining pregnancy by suppressing the mother's immune response to the foreign tissue. The authors propose testing the protein's suppression of immunity through experiments involving antibodies and altered expression levels in cells.

Boyd和他的同事们的研究发现，人类基因组中由逆转录病毒DNA遗留下来的蛋白质，特别是ERV-3，在胎盘细胞中大量存在。这表明该蛋白在防止母亲免疫系统排斥胎儿方面起着关键作用。胎盘细胞中该蛋白的存在和丰度暗示了其在维持妊娠过程中的重要性，通过抑制母亲对异体组织的免疫反应来保持胎盘的存在。作者计划通过抗体实验和细胞内免疫抑制功能的调节来测试该蛋白的免疫抑制作用。

[1] "In viewing the globular cluster M4, the dense grouping of elderly stars nearest to Earth, Hubble has detected more than 200 white dwarfs-the largest community of these old, shrunken stars ever identified."
[2] "Dwarfs start out hot but gradually cool and fade in a highly predictable manner. Indeed, a dwarf cools at such a predictable rate that its surface temperature indicates its age."
[3] "The coolest, dimmest dwarfs-those that have lived the longest-thus provide an estimate of the age of the cosmos, independent of such parameters as the expansion rate of the universe and the distance to far-off galaxies."
[4] "Richer emphasizes that none of the M4 dwarfs detected by Hubble are faint enough, or old enough, to serve as cosmic clocks."
[5] "However, its position in the sky enables Hubble to stare at the cluster almost continuously as the telescope orbits Earth. In contrast, Earth often blocks the telescope's view of M4."
[6] "That DNA has been passed down to humans. A study now finds that the protein encoded by this DNA abounds in placental cells-suggesting that the protein may play a useful role today by helping prevent a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting her fetus."
[7] "Or so report Boyd and his colleagues at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology and Chester Beatty Laboratories, both in London, in the Aug. 20 VIROLOGY."
[8] "This protein's abundance in placental cells suggests it's an important factor."

1. The Hubble Space Telescope has detected over 200 white dwarfs in the globular cluster M4, the largest community of old white dwarfs ever identified. These stars are used to estimate the age of the universe because their cooling rate is highly predictable and correlates with their age. However, none of these dwarfs are old enough or bright enough to serve as cosmic clocks. The unique position of M4 in the sky allows Hubble to observe it continuously as it orbits Earth, avoiding the interference caused by Earth blocking the telescope's view. 

2. The DNA left behind by a retrovirus in primate ancestors has been passed down to humans. One of the proteins encoded by this DNA is found abundantly in placental cells. This protein could play a crucial role in preventing a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting her fetus, as it likely helps suppress the immune response to the foreign tissue of the placenta.

1. 哈勃太空望远镜在M4球状星团中发现了超过200颗白矮星，这是迄今为止发现的最大规模的老白矮星群体。这些恒星因其冷却速率高度可预测且与它们的年龄相关，被用于估计宇宙的年龄。然而，并非所有这些矮星都足够古老或亮度足够高以作为宇宙时钟使用。M4的独特天文学位置使得哈勃能够连续观测它，绕地球轨道时避免地球遮挡望远镜的视线。

2. 在灵长类祖先体内遗留下的逆转录病毒DNA已经传给了人类。这种DNA中编码的一个蛋白质在胎盘细胞中大量存在。这个蛋白质可能在防止怀孕女性的免疫系统排斥胎儿方面扮演着关键角色，因为它很可能帮助抑制对胎盘这一“外来”组织的免疫反应。

The study by Boyd and colleagues suggests that the protein encoded by retroviral DNA, specifically ERV-3, plays a crucial role in placental function by preventing a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting the fetus. This protein is abundant in placental cells, indicating its importance in maintaining pregnancy. The researchers propose that this protein might help suppress the mother's immune response, which is otherwise likely to reject the foreign tissue of the placenta due to its high degree of contact with maternal tissues.

The research highlights the evolutionary legacy of retroviruses in humans, which have left traces of their DNA in the genome. This DNA has been passed down through generations and has potential functional roles, such as aiding in the prevention of immune rejection during pregnancy. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between genetic heritage and physiological processes, specifically focusing on the role of retroviral proteins in maintaining the integrity of the maternal-fetal interface.

The findings contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of humans and the adaptive mechanisms that have allowed species to overcome challenges posed by foreign tissues, particularly in the context of pregnancy. They also offer potential avenues for future research into the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune responses and enhancing pregnancy outcomes.

Boyd及其同事的研究表明，由逆转录病毒DNA编码的蛋白质，特别是ERV-3，在胎盘功能中起着关键作用，通过防止孕妇的免疫系统排斥胎儿来维持妊娠。这种蛋白质在胎盘细胞中的大量存在，表明其在维持妊娠过程中的重要性。研究者提出，这种蛋白质可能有助于抑制母亲的免疫反应，否则这种反应会排斥与母体组织接触高度的胎盘组织。

这项研究揭示了人类遗传遗产的进化遗留，这些DNA片段在基因组中留下了痕迹，并且可能具有功能性作用，如帮助预防免疫排斥，尤其是在怀孕期间。研究提供了对遗传遗产与生理过程之间复杂相互作用的理解，特别关注逆转录病毒蛋白在维持母体-胎儿界面完整性中的作用。

这些发现为了解人类进化的历史以及适应机制提供见解，这些机制允许物种克服外源组织带来的挑战，特别是在怀孕的背景下。它们也为未来研究发展治疗策略铺平了道路，旨在调节免疫反应并提高妊娠结果的可能性。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include complex reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the location of active sites on the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process. The proposed reaction mechanisms and the collective effect of different factors contribute to optimizing ODH processes.
