[2] "In particular, notes Hubble investigator Harvey B. Richer of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, the dwarfs discovered in M4 should help fine-tune predictions about how rapidly these objects cool—a critical factor in attempts to infer the age of the universe from the temperature of white dwarfs."
[3] "Dwarfs start out hot but gradually cool and fade in a highly predictable manner. Indeed, a dwarf cools at such a predictable rate that its surface temperature indicates its age."

[5] "However, at least 0.1 percent of the protein in the layer of placental cells that separates the fetus from the mother comes from a known retroviral sequence designated ERV-3."
[6] "A pregnant woman's body regards the fetus as an interloper in some ways, so its natural reaction is to reject it."
[7] "It really invades," Boyd says. "In order for the mother's body to retain the placenta, something has to suppress her immune response to it."

The study by Boyd and his colleagues identifies that the protein encoded by retroviral DNA found in human genomes, specifically ERV-3, is abundant in placental cells. This suggests that the protein plays a crucial role in preventing the mother's immune system from rejecting the fetus. The protein's presence and abundance in placental cells indicate its importance in maintaining pregnancy by suppressing the mother's immune response to the foreign tissue. The authors propose testing the protein's suppression of immunity through experiments involving antibodies and altered expression levels in cells.

Boyd和他的同事们的研究发现，人类基因组中由逆转录病毒DNA遗留下来的蛋白质，特别是ERV-3，在胎盘细胞中大量存在。这表明该蛋白在防止母亲免疫系统排斥胎儿方面起着关键作用。胎盘细胞中该蛋白的存在和丰度暗示了其在维持妊娠过程中的重要性，通过抑制母亲对异体组织的免疫反应来保持胎盘的存在。作者计划通过抗体实验和细胞内免疫抑制功能的调节来测试该蛋白的免疫抑制作用。
