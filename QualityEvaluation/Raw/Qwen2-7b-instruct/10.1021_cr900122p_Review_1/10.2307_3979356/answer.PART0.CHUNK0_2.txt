[1] "In viewing the globular cluster M4, the dense grouping of elderly stars nearest to Earth, Hubble has detected more than 200 white dwarfs-the largest community of these old, shrunken stars ever identified."
[2] "Dwarfs start out hot but gradually cool and fade in a highly predictable manner. Indeed, a dwarf cools at such a predictable rate that its surface temperature indicates its age."
[3] "The coolest, dimmest dwarfs-those that have lived the longest-thus provide an estimate of the age of the cosmos, independent of such parameters as the expansion rate of the universe and the distance to far-off galaxies."
[4] "Richer emphasizes that none of the M4 dwarfs detected by Hubble are faint enough, or old enough, to serve as cosmic clocks."
[5] "However, its position in the sky enables Hubble to stare at the cluster almost continuously as the telescope orbits Earth. In contrast, Earth often blocks the telescope's view of M4."
[6] "That DNA has been passed down to humans. A study now finds that the protein encoded by this DNA abounds in placental cells-suggesting that the protein may play a useful role today by helping prevent a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting her fetus."
[7] "Or so report Boyd and his colleagues at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology and Chester Beatty Laboratories, both in London, in the Aug. 20 VIROLOGY."
[8] "This protein's abundance in placental cells suggests it's an important factor."

1. The Hubble Space Telescope has detected over 200 white dwarfs in the globular cluster M4, the largest community of old white dwarfs ever identified. These stars are used to estimate the age of the universe because their cooling rate is highly predictable and correlates with their age. However, none of these dwarfs are old enough or bright enough to serve as cosmic clocks. The unique position of M4 in the sky allows Hubble to observe it continuously as it orbits Earth, avoiding the interference caused by Earth blocking the telescope's view. 

2. The DNA left behind by a retrovirus in primate ancestors has been passed down to humans. One of the proteins encoded by this DNA is found abundantly in placental cells. This protein could play a crucial role in preventing a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting her fetus, as it likely helps suppress the immune response to the foreign tissue of the placenta.

1. 哈勃太空望远镜在M4球状星团中发现了超过200颗白矮星，这是迄今为止发现的最大规模的老白矮星群体。这些恒星因其冷却速率高度可预测且与它们的年龄相关，被用于估计宇宙的年龄。然而，并非所有这些矮星都足够古老或亮度足够高以作为宇宙时钟使用。M4的独特天文学位置使得哈勃能够连续观测它，绕地球轨道时避免地球遮挡望远镜的视线。

2. 在灵长类祖先体内遗留下的逆转录病毒DNA已经传给了人类。这种DNA中编码的一个蛋白质在胎盘细胞中大量存在。这个蛋白质可能在防止怀孕女性的免疫系统排斥胎儿方面扮演着关键角色，因为它很可能帮助抑制对胎盘这一“外来”组织的免疫反应。
