[1] "Millions of years ago, a retrovirus infected our primate ancestors, leaving a legacy of its DNA in their genes. That DNA has been passed down to humans."
[2] "A study now finds that the protein encoded by this DNA abounds in placental cells-suggesting that the protein may play a useful role today by helping prevent a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting her fetus."
[3] "In primates, the placenta looks 'kind of like a tree stuck into the side of the maternal tissue' as opposed to a flat plate in other mammals."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include complex reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the location of active sites on the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process. The proposed reaction mechanisms and the collective effect of different factors contribute to optimizing ODH processes.
