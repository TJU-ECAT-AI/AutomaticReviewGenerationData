[1] "Viral Legacy May Make Pregnancy Possible"
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study suggests that a retrovirus that infected primate ancestors, leaving its DNA in their genes, might play a useful role in pregnancy by helping prevent a pregnant woman's immune system from rejecting her fetus. Specifically, the protein encoded by this DNA is abundant in placental cells, indicating its potential importance in suppressing the immune response to the fetus.
