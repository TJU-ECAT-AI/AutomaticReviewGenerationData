[1] "Vanadium is a key component of V-Sb-oxide for propane ammoxidation and plays a role both in the step of propane to propene transformation and in the further conversion to acrylonitrile."
[2] "The analysis of the structure/composition and activity relationships suggests that the active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."
[3] "Vanadium species play a catalytic role in the selective activation of propane,although the presence of two competitive routes involving different centers associated with vanadium ions has been shown."
[4] "Ammonia chemisorption, however, selectively inhibits one of the two routes and favors the pathway through intermediate propene formation."
[5] "Supra-surface VS+-oxide catalyzes the unselective NH3---N2 conversion with a lowering in acrylonitrile selectivity."

1. Vanadium is crucial in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, functioning in both the conversion of propane to propene and the subsequent conversion of propene to acrylonitrile. 

2. The effective catalyst for selective acrylonitrile synthesis from propane is identified as a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it.

3. Vanadium ions exhibit dual catalytic functions in the process, contributing to both the activation of propane and the reoxidation of reduced antimony oxide species.

4. Ammonia's chemisorption selectively hinders one of the two competing reaction pathways, promoting the route involving the formation of propene as an intermediate.

5. Supra-surface VS+-oxide catalyzes the undesired conversion of ammonia to nitrogen, negatively impacting the selectivity for acrylonitrile production.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a challenging process due to the high selectivity required to produce alkenes or aromatics from paraffins. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process, including both bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The efficiency of the process is influenced by various factors such as catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. Site isolation is a key strategy to address selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific sites on the catalyst surface.

One proposed mechanism involves C-H bond activation, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane molecule, forming an alkyl radical. This radical then undergoes further reactions to produce the desired alkene or aromatic product. Another mechanism involves the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, where the metal center forms a complex with an alkyl group, facilitating the subsequent reactions. 2H-abstraction is another step in these mechanisms, where a hydrogen atom is removed from the alkane molecule, leading to the formation of an alkene.

High selectivity and conversion require careful control over the catalyst properties, including its composition, morphology, and surface chemistry. The interplay between these factors determines the process efficiency. Site isolation helps to address selectivity issues by ensuring that the desired reactions occur at specific sites on the catalyst, while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This strategy allows for the optimization of the catalyst for the desired product, enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

1. Introduction
Acrylonitrile is a widely used chemical with a production of over five million tons per year principally by catalytic heterogeneous gas phase ammoxidation of propene. The cost of the hydrocarbon feedstock has a significant effect on the overall production cost and this fact drives the search for alternative processes using less costly raw materials [1]. The use of propane in place of propene is the natural choice for an alternative process [2-4], due to the significant price difference between the two hydrocarbons:
CH3-CH2-CH3

CH2=CH-CN

The introduction discusses the widespread use and production of acrylonitrile, driven by its role in industrial applications. It highlights the significant impact of hydrocarbon feedstock costs on production costs, leading to the exploration of alternative, less expensive raw materials. Propane is identified as a viable substitute for propene due to its lower cost, despite potential challenges in processing. The review focuses on V-Sb-oxide catalysts, which are claimed for the direct synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane, and explores their catalytic, kinetic, and mechanistic features, particularly the role of vanadium.

1. Vanadium plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, including both the initial step of alkane to olefin transformation and the subsequent conversion to acrylonitrile. The key to achieving high efficiency lies in understanding the interplay between various catalysts and the reaction mechanisms involved.

2. The active catalyst for selective acrylonitrile synthesis from propane is identified as a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it. This structure supports the high selectivity and conversion required for efficient ODH processes.

3. Vanadium ions act as catalytic centers for selective activation of alkanes. However, there are two competing pathways involving different vanadium ion centers that influence the ODH process.

4. Supra-surface VS+-oxide facilitates the unselective conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas, thereby reducing the selectivity for acrylonitrile production. 

5. Vanadium ions also catalyze the reoxidation of reduced antimony oxide species, which are active in the acrylonitrile synthesis from propene intermediates. This reoxidation process is influenced by the non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate.

6. Ammonia modifies the surface reactivity of the catalyst, affecting both the acid-base and redox properties. This modification contributes to the complex surface network that governs the ODH process and its key features.
