[1] "Vanadium is a key component of V-Sb-oxide for propane ammoxidation and plays a role both in the step of propane to propene transformation and in the further conversion to acrylonitrile."
[2] "The analysis of the structure/composition and activity relationships suggests that the active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."
[3] "Vanadium species play a catalytic role in the selective activation of propane,although the presence of two competitive routes involving different centers associated with vanadium ions has been shown."
[4] "Supra-surface VS+-oxide catalyzes the unselective NH3---N2 conversion with a lowering in acrylonitrile selectivity."
[5] "In addition, vanadium ions catalyze the reoxidation of supra-surface SbS+-oxide, the active species for acrylonitrile synthesis from intermediate propene."
[6] "The role of ammonia in the modification of surface reactivity (acid-base and redox properties) has also been shown as well as the presence of a complex surface network which explain various key features observed in the catalytic behavior."

1. Vanadium plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, including both the initial step of alkane to olefin transformation and the subsequent conversion to acrylonitrile. The key to achieving high efficiency lies in understanding the interplay between various catalysts and the reaction mechanisms involved.

2. The active catalyst for selective acrylonitrile synthesis from propane is identified as a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it. This structure supports the high selectivity and conversion required for efficient ODH processes.

3. Vanadium ions act as catalytic centers for selective activation of alkanes. However, there are two competing pathways involving different vanadium ion centers that influence the ODH process.

4. Supra-surface VS+-oxide facilitates the unselective conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas, thereby reducing the selectivity for acrylonitrile production. 

5. Vanadium ions also catalyze the reoxidation of reduced antimony oxide species, which are active in the acrylonitrile synthesis from propene intermediates. This reoxidation process is influenced by the non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate.

6. Ammonia modifies the surface reactivity of the catalyst, affecting both the acid-base and redox properties. This modification contributes to the complex surface network that governs the ODH process and its key features.
