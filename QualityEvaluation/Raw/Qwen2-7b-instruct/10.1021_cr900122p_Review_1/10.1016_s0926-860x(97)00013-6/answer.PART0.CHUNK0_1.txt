The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a challenging process due to the high selectivity required to produce alkenes or aromatics from paraffins. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process, including both bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The efficiency of the process is influenced by various factors such as catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. Site isolation is a key strategy to address selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific sites on the catalyst surface.

One proposed mechanism involves C-H bond activation, where a metal center abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane molecule, forming an alkyl radical. This radical then undergoes further reactions to produce the desired alkene or aromatic product. Another mechanism involves the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, where the metal center forms a complex with an alkyl group, facilitating the subsequent reactions. 2H-abstraction is another step in these mechanisms, where a hydrogen atom is removed from the alkane molecule, leading to the formation of an alkene.

High selectivity and conversion require careful control over the catalyst properties, including its composition, morphology, and surface chemistry. The interplay between these factors determines the process efficiency. Site isolation helps to address selectivity issues by ensuring that the desired reactions occur at specific sites on the catalyst, while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This strategy allows for the optimization of the catalyst for the desired product, enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODH process.
