[1] "Vanadium is a key component of V-Sb-oxide for propane ammoxidation and plays a role both in the step of propane to propene transformation and in the further conversion to acrylonitrile."
[2] "The analysis of the structure/composition and activity relationships suggests that the active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."
[3] "Vanadium species play a catalytic role in the selective activation of propane,although the presence of two competitive routes involving different centers associated with vanadium ions has been shown."
[4] "Ammonia chemisorption, however, selectively inhibits one of the two routes and favors the pathway through intermediate propene formation."
[5] "Supra-surface VS+-oxide catalyzes the unselective NH3---N2 conversion with a lowering in acrylonitrile selectivity."

1. Vanadium is crucial in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, functioning in both the conversion of propane to propene and the subsequent conversion of propene to acrylonitrile. 

2. The effective catalyst for selective acrylonitrile synthesis from propane is identified as a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it.

3. Vanadium ions exhibit dual catalytic functions in the process, contributing to both the activation of propane and the reoxidation of reduced antimony oxide species.

4. Ammonia's chemisorption selectively hinders one of the two competing reaction pathways, promoting the route involving the formation of propene as an intermediate.

5. Supra-surface VS+-oxide catalyzes the undesired conversion of ammonia to nitrogen, negatively impacting the selectivity for acrylonitrile production.
