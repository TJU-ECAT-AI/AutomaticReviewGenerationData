Review V-Sb-oxide catalysts for the ammoxidation of propane Gabriele Centi*, Siglinda Perathoner, Ferruccio Trifirb Dip. di Chimica lndustriale e dei Materiali, V.le Risorgimento 4, 40136 Bologna, Italy Abstract V-Sb-oxide catalysts are claimed in several patents as the active components for a new process of direct acrylonitrile synthesis from propane. In this review the main catalytic, kinetic and mechanistic features of these catalysts are discussed with reference to the role of vanadium as the key component. Specific topics discussed include: (i) nature of the phases present in V-Sb-oxide catalysts, their modification during the catalytic reaction and nature of the non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate, (ii) catalytic and kinetic behavior as well as some specific aspects which characterize their reactivity, (iii) structure-activity and selectivity relationships, and (iv) reaction mechanism, influence on the surface reactivity of chemisorbed species (ammonia, in particular) and presence of competitive pathways of transformation.
Keywords: Propane; Acrylonitrile; V-Sb-oxides; Vanadium; Antimony
1. Introduction
Acrylonitrile is a widely used chemical with a production of over five million tons per year principally by catalytic heterogeneous gas phase ammoxidation of propene. The cost of the hydrocarbon feedstock has a significant effect on the overall production cost and this fact drives the search for alternative processes using less costly raw materials [1]. The use of propane in place of propene is the natural choice for an alternative process [2-4], due to the significant price difference between the two hydrocarbons:
CH3-CH2-CH3
+ NH3 + 202
CH2=CH-CN
+ 4H20

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The introduction discusses the widespread use and production of acrylonitrile, driven by its role in industrial applications. It highlights the significant impact of hydrocarbon feedstock costs on production costs, leading to the exploration of alternative, less expensive raw materials. Propane is identified as a viable substitute for propene due to its lower cost, despite potential challenges in processing. The review focuses on V-Sb-oxide catalysts, which are claimed for the direct synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane, and explores their catalytic, kinetic, and mechanistic features, particularly the role of vanadium.

引言部分讨论了丙烯腈的广泛应用及其每年超过五百万吨的生产量，主要通过异相气体相催化氧化丙烯制备。原料成本对整体生产成本的影响显著，这促使寻找使用更低成本原料的替代工艺。将丙烷作为丙烯的替代品是自然的选择，由于两种烃类之间存在显著的价格差异：
CH3-CH2-CH3
+ NH3 + 2O2
CH2=CH-CN
+ 4H2O
