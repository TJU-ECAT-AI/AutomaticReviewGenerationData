Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems influences the process efficiency significantly. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the formation of unwanted side products. Catalysts, particularly those based on molybdenum oxide, are central to these processes. Proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, the creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation within the catalyst structure plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by regulating the reaction pathways.
