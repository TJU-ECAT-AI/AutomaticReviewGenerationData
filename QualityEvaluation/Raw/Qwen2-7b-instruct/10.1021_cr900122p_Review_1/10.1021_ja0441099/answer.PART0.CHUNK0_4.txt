Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the importance of catalysts in determining the efficiency of the process. It discusses the use of both bulk metal oxides and supported systems, which are critical components in ODH reactions. Achieving high selectivity and conversion remains a challenge due to the need for precise control over reaction pathways. The document proposes mechanisms involving C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. To address selectivity issues, site isolation techniques are employed to manage the reaction environment and catalyst structure, thereby influencing the process efficiency through effects on reaction rates, product distribution, and catalyst stability.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），文献强调了催化剂在决定过程效率中的作用。它讨论了两种类型的催化剂，即纯金属氧化物和负载系统，在ODH反应中至关重要。实现高选择性和转化率仍然是一个挑战，因为需要精确控制反应途径。文献提出了涉及C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽象的机制。为解决选择性问题，采用位点隔离技术来管理反应环境和催化剂结构，从而通过影响反应速率、产物分布和催化剂稳定性来影响过程效率。
