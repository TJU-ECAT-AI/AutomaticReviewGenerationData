Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe the use of various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are attributed to complex reaction pathways and competing side reactions. Catalyst deactivation, especially due to coke formation, poses significant obstacles in industrial applications. Reaction mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is crucial for enhancing product specificity by addressing selectivity issues. Improving catalyst design and understanding detailed reaction mechanisms are pivotal in enhancing the overall efficiency of the process.
