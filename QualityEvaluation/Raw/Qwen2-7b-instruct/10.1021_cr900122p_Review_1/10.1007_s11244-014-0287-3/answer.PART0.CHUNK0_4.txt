[1] "The 6th Irsee Symposium sponsored by the Robert Karl Grasselli Foundation took place between 4 and 7 July 2013 at the Schwbisches Bildungszentrum in Irsee, Germany."
[2] "The main purpose of the meeting was to bring together a small, select group of experts in the field of selective oxidation catalysis from around the world in a tranquil and hospitable environment to informally discuss their newest findings and to exchange views of how to further advance the field, and thereby impact the wellbeing of the world."
[3] "A significant number of presentations, recorded here, dealt with the subject of the MoVNbTeOx catalyst, particularly the M1 phase, for the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid or ammoxidation to acrylonitrile."
[4] "Theoretical studies of the VPO system for the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride reveal the revolutionary concept which proposes that the paraffin is activated by a non-metal oxo-moiety, namely by P5+=O, rather than by a metal oxo-moiety, namely V5+=O, as has been generally agreed upon up to now."
[5] "An analysis of the pertinent patent literature pertaining to VPO catalysts aims at identifying clues about how to improve the commercial catalyst, since any single digit yield improvement on a scale of 2.7 Billion Tons/year world production would save a significant amount of unnecessarily wasted hydrocarbon feed and therefore presents a substantial economic incentive."
[6] "Several papers covered sophisticated instrumental techniques for characterizing oxidation catalysts; some covered homogeneous catalytic systems for the synthesis of complex oxygenated molecules that can be used as building blocks for pharmaceuticals; still others dealt with sustainable catalytic systems for epoxidation reactions useful in environmentally friendly biosynthetic areas; and a first at these symposia was a contribution reviewing the benefits of Au-catalyzed selective oxidations."
[7] "Concluding our symposium were presentations in the area of electrocatalysis that explored the very fundamentals of this exciting field and concluded with some real-world examples for electrocatalytically producing products of interest in everyday life."
