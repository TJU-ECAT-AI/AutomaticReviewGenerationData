[1] "A significant number of presentations, recorded here, dealt with the subject of the MoVNbTeOx catalyst, particularly the M1 phase, for the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid or ammoxidation to acrylonitrile."
[2] "Theoretical studies of the VPO system for the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride reveal the revolutionary concept which proposes that the paraffin is activated by a non-metal oxo-moiety, namely by P5+=O, rather than by a metal oxo-moiety, namely V5+=O, as has been generally agreed upon up to now."
[3] "A new catalytic approach to the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene was presented using Dy-doped (oxy)halides as catalysts."
[4] "Several papers covered sophisticated instrumental techniques for characterizing oxidation catalysts; some covered homogeneous catalytic systems for the synthesis of complex oxygenated molecules that can be used as building blocks for pharmaceuticals."
[5] "The 6th Irsee Symposium sponsored by the Robert Karl Grasselli Foundation took place between 4 and 7 July 2013 at the Schwbisches Bildungszentrum in Irsee, Germany."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion involve the optimization of catalyst properties and reaction conditions. Proposed reaction mechanisms focus on C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by enhancing the reactivity of specific sites on the catalyst surface. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by affecting the rate of reaction, product distribution, and catalyst stability. Advanced characterization techniques and novel catalyst designs contribute to improving selectivity and yield in ODH reactions.
