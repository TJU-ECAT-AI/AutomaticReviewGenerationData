[1] "A significant number of presentations, recorded here, dealt with the subject of the MoVNbTeOx catalyst, particularly the M1 phase, for the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid or ammoxidation to acrylonitrile."
[2] "The structure of the M1 system is now thoroughly studied and understood, based on spectroscopic and electron microscopic studies, and the reaction mechanistic consequences drawn therefrom are updated to reflect the latest structural refinements."
[3] "Theoretical studies of the VPO system for the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride reveal the revolutionary concept which proposes that the paraffin is activated by a non-metal oxo-moiety, namely by P5+=O, rather than by a metal oxo-moiety, namely V5+=O, as has been generally agreed upon up to now."
[4] "An analysis of the pertinent patent literature pertaining to VPO catalysts aims at identifying clues about how to improve the commercial catalyst, since any single digit yield improvement on a scale of 2.7 Billion Tons/year world production would save a significant amount of unnecessarily wasted hydrocarbon feed and therefore presents a substantial economic incentive."
[5] "Several papers covered sophisticated instrumental techniques for characterizing oxidation catalysts; some covered homogeneous catalytic systems for the synthesis of complex oxygenated molecules that can be used as building blocks for pharmaceuticals; still others dealt with sustainable catalytic systems for epoxidation reactions useful in environmentally friendly biosynthetic areas; and a first at these symposia was a contribution reviewing the benefits of Au-catalyzed selective oxidations."
[6] "A new catalytic approach to the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene was presented using Dy-doped (oxy)halides as catalysts. These systems operate as melts, are stable under reaction conditions, have long life times, and most impressively do not produce any chlorinated byproducts, even though operated at rather high temperatures (600 C), that were the culprits in earlier catalytic systems using halogen containing catalysts or halide co-feeds."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems are discussed in the context of achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process include the need for efficient C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it helps in directing the reaction pathways towards desired products. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency, aiming to optimize both selectivity and yield. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve the activation of alkanes through specific moieties on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of intermediate species that undergo further transformations to produce the desired products. The economic incentives for improving catalyst performance are substantial, considering the potential savings from reducing waste and enhancing product yields on a global scale. Advanced characterization techniques are employed to understand catalyst behavior and guide the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic systems. The introduction of novel catalysts, such as Dy-doped (oxy)halides, demonstrates innovative approaches to ODH, offering advantages like stability, longevity, and the avoidance of chlorinated byproducts, which were problematic in earlier catalyst systems.
