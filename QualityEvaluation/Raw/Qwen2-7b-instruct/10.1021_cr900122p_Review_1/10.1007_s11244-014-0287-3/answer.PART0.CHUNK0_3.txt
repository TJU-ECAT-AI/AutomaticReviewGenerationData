<p>The 6th Irsee Symposium sponsored by the Robert Karl Grasselli Foundation took place between 4 and 7 July 2013 at the Schwäbisches Bildungszentrum in Irsee, Germany.</p>
<p>The symposium began, appropriately for these forward looking gatherings, with a presentation dealing with designing catalysts for tomorrow's processes; a noble task indeed; and thereby set an ambitious tone for the whole symposium.</p>
<p>A significant number of presentations, recorded here, dealt with the subject of the MoVNbTeOx catalyst, particularly the M1 phase, for the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid or ammoxidation to acrylonitrile.</p>
<p>Theoretical studies of the VPO system for the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride reveal the revolutionary concept which proposes that the paraffin is activated by a non-metal oxo-moiety, namely by P5+=O, rather than by a metal oxo-moiety, namely V5+=O, as has been generally agreed upon up to now.</p>
<p>Several papers covered sophisticated instrumental techniques for characterizing oxidation catalysts; some covered homogeneous catalytic systems for the synthesis of complex oxygenated molecules that can be used as building blocks for pharmaceuticals; still others dealt with sustainable catalytic systems for epoxidation reactions useful in environmentally friendly biosynthetic areas; and a first at these symposia was a contribution reviewing the benefits of Au-catalyzed selective oxidations.</p>
<p>Concluding our symposium were presentations in the area of electrocatalysis that explored the very fundamentals of this exciting field and concluded with some real-world examples for electrocatalytically producing products of interest in everyday life.</p>

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the importance of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are highlighted, focusing on the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. The document also mentions theoretical studies proposing that in the VPO system, n-butane is activated by a non-metal oxo-moiety (P5+=O) rather than by a metal oxo-moiety (V5+=O), which contrasts with previously held beliefs. Additionally, the document covers the use of sophisticated instrumental techniques for catalyst characterization, homogeneous catalytic systems for synthesizing oxygenated molecules used in pharmaceuticals, sustainable catalytic systems for epoxidation reactions, and Au-catalyzed selective oxidations. Lastly, it touches on electrocatalysis, presenting fundamental insights and real-world applications.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，文献讨论了各种催化剂的作用，包括体金属氧化物和负载型系统。强调了实现高选择性和转化率的挑战，并指出位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。文献还提到了关于VPO系统的理论研究，指出n-丁烷被非金属氧基团（P5+=O）激活，而不是金属氧基团（V5+=O），这与以往的认识有所不同。此外，文献涉及了用于催化剂表征的高级仪器技术、用于合成制药中使用的复杂氧分子的均相催化系统、环境友好生物合成领域有用的氧化反应的可持续催化系统以及Au催化的选择性氧化。最后，它涵盖了电催化，展示了基础研究和实际应用的例子。
