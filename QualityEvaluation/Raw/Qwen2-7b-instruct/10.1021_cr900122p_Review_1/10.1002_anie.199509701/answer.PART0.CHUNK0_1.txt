[1] "The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH,."
[2] "The effect of the simultaneous presence of CH, and 0, over the catalyst is illustrated by the results of Figure 5, which were obtained over a Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst"
[3] "In poisoning the centers responsible for CH, activation, CO, has a profound effect on the kinetics of the coupling reaction."
[4] "Although most investigators point out that the mechanism involves the coupling of methyl and benzyl radicals, it is not certain whether the reaction occurs on the surface or in the gas phase."
[5] "The mechanism for the formation and reactions of these radicals is reasonably well understood ; however, less is known about the sites that are responsible for the activation of CH, and the hydrocarbon products."

1. The activation of methane in the oxidative coupling reaction is likely due to multiple types of centers on the catalyst surface, not just a single kind.

2. The results in Figure 5 demonstrate the impact of simultaneously supplying methane and oxygen to the catalyst, as seen with a Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst.

3. Carbon monoxide (CO) significantly alters the kinetic properties of the methane coupling reaction by affecting the activation centers.

4. The mechanism for the coupling of methane and benzyl radicals to form hydrocarbons is generally accepted, but the exact location, whether on the surface or in the gas phase, is uncertain.

5. While the formation and reactions of the radicals are reasonably well-understood, the specific sites responsible for activating methane and producing hydrocarbon products remain less clear.

1. 在氧化耦合反应中，甲烷的激活可能由催化剂表面的多种类型中心负责，而不仅仅是单一类型。

2. 图5的结果展示了同时向催化剂供应甲烷和氧气的效果，以Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO,催化剂为例。

3. 碳一氧化物（CO）通过影响激活中心对甲烷耦合反应的动力学产生了显著影响。

4. 甲烷与苯基自由基耦合形成烃类的机制通常被接受，但具体发生的位置，是在表面还是在气体中，尚不明确。

5. 虽然自由基的形成和反应的机理相对清楚，但对于激活甲烷和产生烃类产物的具体位点了解较少。
