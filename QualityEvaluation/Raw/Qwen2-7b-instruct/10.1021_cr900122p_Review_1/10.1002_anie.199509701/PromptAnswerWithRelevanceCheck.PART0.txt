1.At a constant level of 5% CH, conversion, the C,selectivity increased from 45 % to 64 % upon the addition of CO, to the reagent stream.

2.One manifestation of the CO, effect on selectivity is that while catalyst conversion increases, the selectivity to a partial oxidation product decreases as the residence time in the catalyst bed increases.

3.The unique behavior of the chlorided Li/MgO catalyst, characterized by high (super)basicity and a C, yield of 24.2%, is found only at Cl/Li ratios of 20.9. Below this ratio, Li,CO, is formed, leading to typical Li/MgO catalyst characteristics.

4.In the ally1 radical, most of the spin density is located on the terminal carbons. This explains why the major C, products formed were linear butenes and butadiene, rather than isobutylene.

[1] "The fundamental aspects of the problem involve both a heterogeneous component, which includes the activation of CH4 on a metal oxide surface, and a homogeneous gas-phase component, which includes free-radical chemistry."

[2] "The yield of C2H and C3H is limited by secondary reactions of CH2 radicals with the surface and by the further oxidation of C2H, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase."

[3] "Less is known about the nature of the active centers than about the reaction mechanism; however, reactive oxygen ions are apparently required for the activation of CH4 on certain catalysts."

[4] "Many of the better oxidative coupling catalysts are listed in Table 1, along with the conversions and selectivities that have been achieved."

[5] "The more effective catalysts may be divided into five groups: highly basic pure oxides, of which the early members of the lanthanide oxide series (excluding CeO,) are the best; Group IA or IIA ions supported on basic oxides (for example, Li/MgO, Ba/MgO and Sr/LaO,); monophasic oxides; a few transition metal oxides that contain Group IA ions; and any of these materials that are promoted with chloride ions."

[6] "The mechanism for this direct oxidation should therefore be considered. A simple calculation shows that a CH2 radical would collide with the surface of the catalyst approximately 10^10 times before it reacts with another CH2 radical in the gas phase."

[7] "The origin of COX has been determined by adding ^13C2H6 or ^13CH4 to the CH4 reagent stream and observing the fraction of ^13CO2 that appears as a product."

[8] "The extent of the CO2 effect depends very much on the basicity of the catalyst."

[12] "The mechanism involved the oxidative methylation of propylene, followed by the loss of a hydrogen atom."

[13] "The identification of the active forms of surface oxygen on the Group IA and IIA metal oxides remains as one of the significant challenges in this area of research."

1. The key challenges in the oxidative coupling of methane include the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface, the formation of free radicals, and the limited yield of ethene due to secondary reactions. The nature of the active centers is not fully understood, but reactive oxygen ions are known to be crucial. The efficiency is influenced by factors like catalyst choice, reaction conditions, and selectivity issues.

2. Chlorine-containing catalysts, particularly those with a Cl/Li ratio of 20.9, exhibit a high C2H/C3H product ratio in oxidative coupling reactions, indicating a unique behavior. In contrast, the same catalysts show high basicity and adsorption of CO2 in cross-coupling reactions. 

3. The oxidative coupling of methane differs from other cross-coupling reactions in that it primarily involves the coupling of methane and oxygen to form ethene, with subsequent sequential reactions leading to the formation of higher hydrocarbons. The role of radical coupling is emphasized, especially on the catalyst surface, and the mechanism involves the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of alkyl radicals.

4. The main limitations in developing a commercial process for the oxidative coupling of methane include the inefficient conversion of methane to ethene, the undesired formation of CO2, and the challenge of integrating advanced separation technology with novel reactor designs. Research is focused on improving catalysts, understanding reaction mechanisms, and optimizing process conditions.

5. The nature of the active centers in the oxidative coupling of methane is diverse, including surface oxygen ions, chloride ions, and potentially peroxide ions. The presence and concentration of these active centers are critical for the activation of methane and the formation of hydrocarbons. Understanding their role contributes to a deeper insight into the reaction mechanism.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the complexity of the reactions involved, such as the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The basicity of the catalyst plays a crucial role in these processes, as seen in the effect of CO on the reaction when added to the reagents during oxidative coupling. CO can improve selectivity, but it can also poison certain sites, affecting the further oxidation of C-H to CO. The residence time in the catalyst bed also impacts selectivity, as seen in the manifestation of CO's role on selectivity. The diversity of catalysts suggests that multiple types of active centers might contribute to the activation of CH, rather than a single type. The simultaneous presence of CH and O over the catalyst is critical, as it affects the efficiency of the reaction. The early discovery of Li/MgO as an effective catalyst highlighted the importance of [Li+O-] centers in the activation of CH. Analogous centers have been observed in other catalysts, such as Li/ZnO and Na/CaO. High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) of model Li/MgO catalysts suggests that F-centers or F-center aggregates might function as active centers on Li/MgO.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程受到各种催化剂之间相互作用的影响，包括体金属氧化物和支撑系统。在实现高选择性和转化率时面临的挑战主要来自于反应过程的复杂性，如C-H键的活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H的抽象。催化剂的碱性在这些过程中起着关键作用，例如当向耦合反应中添加CO时，CO对反应的影响。CO可以改善选择性，但也可以毒害某些位点，影响C-H进一步氧化为CO。催化剂床中的停留时间也会影响选择性，这体现在CO在选择性上的表现。催化剂的多样性表明，可能有多种活性中心参与CH的激活，而不仅仅是单一类型。同时存在CH和O对催化剂的影响至关重要，它影响反应的效率。早期发现Li/MgO作为有效催化剂凸显了Li+O-中心在CH活化中的重要性。其他催化剂如Li/ZnO和Na/CaO中也观察到了类似中心。高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）研究表明，Li/MgO催化剂上的F中心或F中心聚合物可能作为活性中心发挥作用。
