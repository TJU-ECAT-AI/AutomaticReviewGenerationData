[4] "It was pointed out by Sinev et al. and Otsuka et al. that Na,O, and BaO, are capable of converting CH, into C,H, at temperatures above 500 C. The reactions were stoichiometric rather than catalytic, because both sodium and barium form stable carbonates at these temperatures."
[5] "The use of XPS to detect peroxide ions suffers from the fact that it is an ex situ method. By contrast, with Raman spectroscopy results can be obtained in the presence of the reagents and the catalyst at temperatures up to 800C."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane has been successfully conducted using several oxidative coupling catalysts.
2. The initial step for both methane (CH, ) and ethane (C,H, ) is thought to involve the formation of alkyl radicals.
3. The subsequent reactions for methyl and ethyl radicals differ; with oxygen (O) present, reaction (11) is favored over coupling or the unimolecular loss of radicals.
4. Sodium oxide (Na,O,) and barium oxide (BaO,) were shown by Sinev et al. and Otsuka et al. to convert methane (CH, ) into ethane (C,H, ) at temperatures above 500 C, through stoichiometric reactions resulting in stable carbonates.
5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an ex situ technique for detecting peroxide ions, whereas Raman spectroscopy enables in situ detection of these ions at temperatures up to 800C.

1. 多个较好的氧化耦合催化剂也被研究用于乙烷的氧化脱氢反应，且在每种情况下，催化剂都证明了对这一反应的有效性。
2. 甲烷（CH,）和乙烷（C,H,）的初始激活步骤被认为是一样的，即形成烷基自由基。
3. 然而，甲基和乙基自由基的后续反应不同，在氧气（O）存在的情况下，反应（11）被优先选择而不是耦合或单分子丢失反应。
4. Sinev等和Otsuka等人的研究表明，钠氧化物（Na,O,）和钡氧化物（BaO,）在超过500°C的温度下能够将甲烷（CH,）转化为乙烷（C,H,），通过生成稳定碳酸盐的等摩尔反应。
5. X射线光电子能谱（XPS）是一种离线技术，用于检测过氧化物离子，相比之下，拉曼光谱则允许在温度高达800°C时进行原位检测这些离子。
