[1] "The role of CO, in improving C, selectivity from CH,, or C,H, selectivity from C,H,, is illustrated by the results in Table 3. At a constant level of 5% CH, conversion, the C,selectivity increased from 45 % to 64 % upon the addition of"
[2] "One of the manifestations of this effect is the effect of residence time on selectivity. Usually in oxidation catalysis the conversion increases, but selectivity to a partial oxidation product decreases as the residence time in the catalyst bed increases."
[3] "The unique behavior of the chlorided Li/MgO is found only at Cl/Li ratios20.9. At lower CI/Li ratios Li,CO, is formed and the characteristics of a typical Li/MgO catalyst are observed."
[4] "In the ally1 radical most of the spin density is on the terminal carbons. Thus it is not surprising that the major C, products were linear butenes and butadiene, rather than isobutylene."

1.At a constant level of 5% CH, conversion, the C,selectivity increased from 45 % to 64 % upon the addition of CO, to the reagent stream.

2.One manifestation of the CO, effect on selectivity is that while catalyst conversion increases, the selectivity to a partial oxidation product decreases as the residence time in the catalyst bed increases.

3.The unique behavior of the chlorided Li/MgO catalyst, characterized by high (super)basicity and a C, yield of 24.2%, is found only at Cl/Li ratios of 20.9. Below this ratio, Li,CO, is formed, leading to typical Li/MgO catalyst characteristics.

4.In the ally1 radical, most of the spin density is located on the terminal carbons. This explains why the major C, products formed were linear butenes and butadiene, rather than isobutylene.

1.在CH,转化率保持为5%的情况下，通过向反应流中添加CO，C的选择性从45%增加到了64%。

2.CO,效果的一个表现是：虽然催化剂的转化率会增加，但产物选择性会随着催化剂床层停留时间的延长而降低。

3.氯化处理的Li/MgO催化剂的唯一独特行为发生在Cl/Li比例为20.9时。低于这个比例，Li,CO,形成，表现出典型的Li/MgO催化剂特性。

4.在烯丙基自由基中，大部分自旋密度位于末端碳原子上。这解释了主要的C,产品为线性丁二烯和丁二烯，而不是异丁烯的原因。
