Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts plays a significant role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process include the high stability of alkanes, which makes their activation more difficult. This stability is due to the electronic structure, particularly the tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protecting the carbon atoms. Among primary carbons, the CH bond energy is the highest, contributing to the stability of alkanes. The high dissociation energy of the CH bond of ethane compared to other bonds in other molecules impacts the maximum attainable selectivity. High selectivity is observed when the difference in dissociation enthalpy between the weakest CH bond of the reactant and the weakest CC or CH bond of the product is less than 30 kJ/mol. Conversely, selectivity drops significantly above 70 kJ/mol. The relative reactivity of the reactant and product underlies the limiting selectivity under conventional reaction conditions. The formulation of catalysts influences their interaction with the reactant and products, thereby affecting the selectivity and conversion efficiency. Site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues, as it helps in directing the reaction pathway towards desired products.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，各种催化剂之间的相互作用在实现高选择性和转化率方面起着关键作用。这一过程面临的挑战包括烷烃的高稳定性，这使得它们的活化更加困难。这种稳定性是由于电子结构，特别是CH键的四面体排列保护碳原子。在主要碳中，CH键的能量最高，这有助于烷烃的稳定性。烷烃中CH键的高解离能与其它分子中的其他键相比，影响了最大可实现的选择性。当反应物中最弱的CH键与产物中最弱的CC或CH键的解离焓差小于30 kJ/mol时，观察到很高的选择性。反之，当该差异超过70 kJ/mol时，选择性会显著降低。反应物和产品的相对活性决定了在常规反应条件下限制选择性的因素。催化剂的配方会影响其与反应物和产物的相互作用，从而影响选择性和转化效率。位点隔离对于解决选择性问题至关重要，因为它有助于将反应路径引导至所需的产品。
