[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity."
[2] "Very high selectivity is observed if the difference is less than 30 kJ/mol, while it is minimal above 70 kJ/mol."
[3] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure."
[4] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst."
[5] "The activation of the oxidant depends on its nature. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide."
[6] "The presence of water vapor is essential for high selectivity to acetaldehyde."
[7] "The presence of alkaline additives tends to coordinate to acidic surface species (V, Mo,etc.), affecting the VO bonds."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by multiple factors including the nature of the catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and proposed reaction mechanisms. The high stability of alkanes due to their electronic structure makes their activation harder compared to other hydrocarbons. Selectivity is limited when the difference in the dissociation enthalpy of the weakest C-H bond in the reactant and that of the weakest C-C or C-H bond in the product is greater than 30 kJ/mol. Activation of the alkane's C-H bond by the catalyst requires an affinity between the alkane and the catalyst's surface. The activation of the oxidant, especially molecular oxygen, requires a reducible oxide. Water vapor plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity to acetaldehyde. Alkaline additives coordinate with acidic surface species, affecting the catalyst's VO bonds. The yield of acetaldehyde increases with cation size but decreases over time, alongside CO2 yield. Acidic niobia does not affect the structure of supported vanadium oxide species but can increase the amount of surface polymeric species.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程受多种因素影响，包括催化剂的性质、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战以及反应机制。烷烃的高稳定性由于其电子结构使得其激活比其他碳氢化合物更困难。当产物中最弱的C-C或C-H键的分解焓与烷烃中最弱的C-H键的分解焓之差大于30 kJ/mol时，选择性受限。通过催化剂表面存在的亲和力激活烷烃的C-H键。分子氧的激活需要可还原氧化物。水蒸气对于提高乙醛选择性至关重要。碱性添加剂与酸性表面物种协调，影响催化剂的VO键。随着离子尺寸的增加，乙醛的产率增加但随时间减少，同时二氧化碳的产率也减少。酸性铌氧化物不会影响支持型钒氧化物物种的结构，但可以增加表面聚集体的数量。
