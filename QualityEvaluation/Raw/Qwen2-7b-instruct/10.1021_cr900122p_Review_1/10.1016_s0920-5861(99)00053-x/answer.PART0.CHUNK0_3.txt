1. The activation of parafns is harder than other hydrocarbons due to their high stability. This stability limits the selectivity in reactions.
2. Alkanes' high stability stems from their electronic structure, specifically the tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protecting carbon atoms.
3. Primary carbons in alkanes have the highest CH energy bond, secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive, and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through secondary and tertiary sites.
4. Ethane, with all primary carbons, is much less reactive than larger homologues due to its high CH bond dissociation energy.
5. The difference in dissociation enthalpy between the weakest CH bond in the reactant and the weakest CC or CH bond in the product correlates with selectivity.
6. Very high selectivity is observed when the difference is less than 30 kJ/mol, while it is minimal above 70 kJ/mol.
7. A linear trend indicates the decrease in selectivity as the stability of the product compared to the reactant decreases.
8. Table 2 shows the dissociation enthalpies of the weakest CH and CC bonds in ethylene and acetaldehyde, along with their difference compared to ethane's weakest CH bond.
9. According to Batiot and Hodnett's analysis, ethane's conversion to ethylene is highly selective, with yields close to 50% and some reports reaching 60%.
10. The relative reactivity of the reactant and product sets the limit on selectivity under conventional reaction conditions.
11. Catalyst formulations impact their interaction with reactants and products.
12. The activity of hydrocarbons, the activation of the oxidant, and the reactivity of lattice oxygen determine the catalyst's performance towards optimal selectivity.
13. Maximum selectivity is determined by the reaction itself, not the catalyst.
14. The initial activation of the CH bond by the catalyst depends on the affinity between the alkane and catalyst surface.
15. Oxide surface acidity depends on the cation's charge and radius, with more oxidized cations increasing acidity and lower valent cations making the oxygen more basic.
16. Alkanes' most reactive hydrogen atoms have a negative charge, favoring interaction with acidic surfaces, except for ethane and methane.
17. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and surface activates molecules.
18. Selectivity is influenced by hydrocarbon-catalyst interaction, catalyst reactivity, and surface hydrocarbon stability.
19. A strong acid-base interaction with the support may degrade partial oxidation products further.
20. Higher hydrocarbons require basic sites for selectivity towards olefins, like butane.
21. Alkaline additives enhance selectivity at a fixed conversion.
22. Catalyst selectivity varies depending on the catalyst's basic character and specific hydrocarbon.
23. N-butane's selectivity trend for catalysts decreases as V2O5/Al2O3>VAPO-5>MgAVPO-5>V2O5/MgO>V2O5/MgOAl2O3, correlating with acidity.
24. Propane shows no specific trend.
25. Catalyst performance is affected by the hydrocarbon's acidity versus the catalyst's.
26. Catalyst reactivity determines how quickly surface intermediates react.
27. High oxygen mobility in total oxidation catalysts like perovskites contrasts with low reactivity in non-reducible oxides requiring high temperatures.
28. High reaction temperatures lead to significant gas-phase radical reactions, promoting ODH products during ethane oxidation.
