Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion due to the inherent stability of alkanes, particularly primary alkanes like ethane. The electronic structure of alkanes, characterized by the tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds, which protect the carbon atoms, makes the activation of these molecules harder compared to other hydrocarbons. This hardness of activation is directly proportional to the strength of the CH bond, which in turn influences the optimal reaction temperature for selective oxidation.

High selectivity in the conversion of ethane to ethylene can be achieved if the difference in the dissociation enthalpy between the weakest CH bond of the reactant hydrocarbon and that of the product is less than 30 kJ/mol. Conversely, selectivity is minimal if the difference exceeds 70 kJ/mol. Ethane, with its highest dissociation energy for the CH bond, exhibits lower reactivity than its larger homologues, making it much less reactive.

The initial activation of the CH bond by the catalyst is crucial and requires an affinity between the alkane and the catalyst's surface. This affinity, along with the hydrocarbon-catalyst interaction, the catalyst's reactivity, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species, collectively determine the selectivity. A strong acid-base interaction with the support might promote further degradation of partial oxidation products.

The selectivity can also be influenced by the nature of the reducing molecule, whether it's molecular oxygen or N2O, with N2O being more selective in forming C2-oxygenates. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is linked to non-selective oxidation, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species favor selective oxidation. The relevance of bulk reduction versus surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule explains discrepancies found in the connection between catalyst activity and reducibility.

In summary, achieving efficient ODH involves overcoming the inherent stability of alkanes, optimizing the interaction between the alkane and the catalyst's surface, and selecting the right reducing agent to ensure high selectivity and conversion.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，实现高选择性和转化率面临重大挑战，尤其是由于烷烃的固有稳定性，特别是乙烷这样的主链烷烃。烷烃的电子结构，由CH键的四面体排列保护碳原子，使得这些分子的激活比其他碳氢化合物更困难。这种激活的难度直接与CH键的强度成正比，进而影响选择性氧化的最佳反应温度。

如果产物的最弱CH键与反应物之间的解离焓差小于30 kJ/mol，则可以通过高选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯。相反，如果差异超过70 kJ/mol，则选择性很低。乙烷因其最强的CH键解离能而表现出较低的活性，使其比其较大的同系物更不活跃。

催化剂表面的亲和力是初始激活CH键的关键，并要求烷烃与催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。这种亲和力，连同烷烃与催化剂的相互作用、催化剂的活性以及表面烷烃物种的稳定性，共同决定了选择性。支持上较强的酸碱相互作用可能促进部分氧化产物的进一步降解。

选择性还可以受到还原剂的性质的影响，无论是分子氧还是N2O，N2O在形成C2氧化物时更具选择性。表面亲电氧物种与非选择性氧化有关，而亲核氧物种则促进选择性氧化。大量关于整体减量与表面减量的差异，以及还原分子的性质解释了催化剂活性与可减性之间发现的分歧。

总之，实现高效的ODH需要克服烷烃的固有稳定性，优化烷烃与催化剂表面之间的相互作用，并选择合适的还原剂以确保高选择性和转化率。
