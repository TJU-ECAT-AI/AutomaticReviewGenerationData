1. The review highlights the importance of catalytic alkane functionalization, emphasizing both organometallic and bioinorganic approaches. It acknowledges ongoing challenges, especially the pursuit of a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization technique. This remains elusive, and deciphering mechanistic problems has proven particularly difficult.

2. Achieving high selectivity and conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) poses significant difficulties. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are crucial in this process. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their ability to efficiently activate C-H bonds and form M-alkyl intermediates.

3. The document discusses the pivotal role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues within the ODH process. This concept suggests that controlling the spatial arrangement and reactivity of catalyst sites can enhance the specificity of the reaction, thereby improving the overall efficiency and product purity.
