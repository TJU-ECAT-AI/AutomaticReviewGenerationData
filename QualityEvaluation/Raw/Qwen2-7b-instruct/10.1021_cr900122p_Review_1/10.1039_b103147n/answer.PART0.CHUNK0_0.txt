The document discusses the ongoing challenges in the field of alkane functionalization with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, particularly focusing on achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization. It acknowledges that despite significant advancements, the ability to perform such functionalization remains elusive. Additionally, the document highlights that understanding the underlying mechanisms, including C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, has proven particularly difficult. These challenges collectively impact the process efficiency and selectivity in the reaction, necessitating further research to address them effectively.
