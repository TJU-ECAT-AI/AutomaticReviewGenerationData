[1] "The chemistry of Cr at the surface is determined by the isoelectric point, the surface area of the support, and the Cr loading."
[2] "Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ are present, each under different coordination and polymerization degrees, depending on the support type and composition."
[3] "Supported Cr ions are mobile and possess a high reactivity toward various molecules, like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water."
[4] "The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar."
[5] "Ultimately, spectroscopic techniques have to be developed which allow measurements in conditions as closely as possible to real conditions of e.g. a catalytic experiment."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges include achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by confining reactive species within specific locations on the catalyst surface. C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction are key steps in the reaction mechanism. These processes collectively influence the efficiency of ODH, with site isolation being particularly important in addressing selectivity issues.
