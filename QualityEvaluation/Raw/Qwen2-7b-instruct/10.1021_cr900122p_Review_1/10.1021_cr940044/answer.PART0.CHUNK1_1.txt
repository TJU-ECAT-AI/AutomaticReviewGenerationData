(1) "Under hydrated conditions, the chemistry of Cr at the surface is determined by the isoelectric point, the surface area of the support, and the Cr loading. Thus, at low loadings and high surface areas, the monochromate:dichromate ratio increases with increasing isoelectric point of the support."
(2) "Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ are present, each under different coordination and polymerization degrees, depending on the support type and composition."
(3) "Supported Cr ions are mobile and possess a high reactivity toward various molecules, like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water."
(4) "The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the complexity of the reaction mechanism, which often involves multiple steps such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the active sites, thus enhancing the reaction efficiency. The interplay between the catalyst's structure, activity, and selectivity is critical for optimizing the process. Factors like the isoelectric point, surface area, and Cr loading significantly influence the chemistry at the surface, impacting both the reaction rate and selectivity. For instance, at low loadings and high surface areas, the monochromate:dichromate ratio tends to increase with the isoelectric point of the support. The presence of Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ under different coordination states under reducing conditions further complicates the mechanism. The mobility of supported Cr ions and their reactivity towards various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water highlight the versatility of these catalysts. Despite similarities, the specific characteristics of amorphous surfaces and molecular sieves require tailored approaches for effective ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及到包括块状金属氧化物和负载系统在内的多种催化剂。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括反应机制的复杂性，通常涉及多个步骤，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-摘除。通过隔离活性位点来解决选择性问题至关重要，从而提高反应效率。结构、活性和选择性之间的相互作用对于优化过程至关重要。因素如等电点、表面面积和Cr负载显著影响表面化学，影响反应速率和选择性。例如，在低负载和高表面积下，支持物的等电点增加时，单铬酸盐：二铬酸盐比倾向于增加。在还原条件下存在Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+，它们处于不同的配位状态和聚合度，这进一步复杂了机制。支持的Cr离子的移动性和其对醇、乙烯、一氧化碳和水等多种分子的反应性强调了这些催化剂的灵活性。尽管存在相似之处，但对于有效的ODH反应，针对无定形表面和分子筛的具体特性需要定制的方法。
