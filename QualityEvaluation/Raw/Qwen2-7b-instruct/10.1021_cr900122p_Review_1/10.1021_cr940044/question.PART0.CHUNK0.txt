I. Introduction
A. General Introduction
Among the transition metal ions of the 3d series, Cr takes a particular position because of its variability in oxidation state, coordination numbers and molecular structure. 1,2 The elucidation of these Cr species on inorganic oxidic surfaces is a complex task, which is of fundamental importance to understanding the behavior of Cr in the environment, colloids, and Cr-based heterogeneous catalysts. 3-6 The environmental behavior of Cr is illustrated in Figure 1. Chromium is frequently encountered in minerals and in geochemical deposits, 7 and due to erosion and weathering, chromium becomes a surface species or can be released into the environment. On the other hand, Cr compounds are used in industries such as leather tanning, electroplating, and pigment production and, therefore, are found in solid wastes and in waste waters. All these Cr oxides are highly soluble and susceptible to various reactions at the solidwater interface: redox processes and homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. Chromium might be oxidized or reduced by soil constituents and such redox reactions have dramatic influences on the behavior of Cr. 8,9 The water soluble and mobile Cr6+ is toxic, while the hazard of the less mobile Cr3+ is relatively low. Manganese oxides are the known naturally occurring oxidants of Cr3+, while Cr6+ is reduced to the less mobile Cr3+ by organic soil constituents (amino, humic, and fulvic acids) and Fe2+.
Figure 1 Behavior of Cr in the environment. Chromium ions can be released from natural chromium sources or by man in the environment, where it is susceptible to redox and homogeneous and/or heterogeneous reactions.
Chromium-based catalysts are composed of Cr oxides supported on inorganic oxides, such as silica, alumina, and molecular sieves. Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2), as illustrated in Figure 2, is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene at relatively low pressures. 10-13 This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle form process in the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most extensively used polymers. Other important catalytic activities are hydrogenationdehydrogenation, oxidation, isomerization, aromatization, and DeNOx reactions. 14-28 The basis for the activity of Cr in such a wide spectrum of reactions lies in the variability of oxidation states, of coordination environments, and of degree of polymerization of Cr oxide species. This variability is especially pronounced on the surface. Thus, knowledge about the surface chemistry of Cr in inorganic oxides is of key importance in environmental sciences and heterogeneous catalysis.

B. Scope of the Review
A prerequisite for understanding the behavior of Cr on surfaces of inorganic oxides is a thorough knowledge of the chemistry and its dependence on the type and composition of the inorganic oxide as well as environmental conditions. In this review, fundamental advances into the surface chemistry and spectroscopy of Cr in inorganic oxides since 1985, the publication year of the review of McDaniel,6 are emphasized. We will restrict ourself to amorphous supports and molecular sieves and, thus, oxygen is the main ligand of Cr.
With the basic principles of solution and solid-state chromium chemistry as the starting point, it will be shown that (1) the support type and composition play a decisive role in the speciation of Cr; (2) a battery of complementary techniques (DRS, RS, IR, XPS, TPR, ESR, EXAFS-XANES, etc.) is necessary to unravel the surface chemistry of Cr; (3) the oxidation states of Cr can be spectroscopically quantified in well-defined conditions; and (4) surface Cr ions are mobile and possess catalytic activity.
II. Molecular Structure of Cr in Aqueous Media and in the Solid State
Chromium occurs with different coordination numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), different oxidation states (Crn+ with n = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), and molecular structures (chromate, dichromate, trichromate, etc.).1 Cr6+ (d0) ions are the mostly tetrahedrally coordinated and tend to form polyoxoanions. Cr3+(d3) is the most stable oxidation state and has been extensively studied. The oxidation states of Cr5+ (d1) and Cr4+ (d2) are rather unstable and Cr5+ easily disproportionates to Cr3+ and Cr6+. The Cr2+ (d4) ions are strongly reducing and only stable in the absence of oxygen.
A. Molecular Structure of Cr in Aqueous Media
The most important oxidation states in solution are Cr6+, Cr3+, and Cr2+.1 The specific chromium oxide species that can exist depend on the solution pH, the chromium oxide concentration, and the redox potential. Cr6+, for example, may be present in water as chromate (CrO42-), dichromate (Cr2O72-), hydrogen chromate (HCrO4-), dihydrogen chromate (H2CrO4), hydrogen dichromate (HCr2O72-), trichromate (Cr3O102-), and tetrachromate (Cr4O132-). The last three ions have been detected only in solutions of pH < 0 or at chromium(VI) concentrations greater than 1 M. Polyanions containing more than four chromium atoms are not known in solution.All these features can be understood on the basis of the Pourbaix diagram presented in Figure 3. 29 Above pH 8, only CrO42- is stable, and as the pH decreases into the pH region 26, the equilibria shifts to dichromate according to the overall equilibrium: Figure 3 The Pourbaix diagram of chromium, expressing the Cr speciation as a function of pH and potential (T = 25 C) (Redrawn from ref 29).At still lower pH values and concentrated media, tri- and tetrachromates are formed (respectively Cr3O102- and Cr4O132-). In summary, decreasing of the pH or increasing the chromium oxide concentration results in the formation of more polymerized chromium oxide species. The Cr6+ species is a strongoxidant but the redox potential depends on the pH. In acidic media, the following reaction is involved while in basic solution In acid solution, Cr3+ is always an octahedral hexaquo ion, Cr(H2O)63+. It tends to hydrolyze with increasing pH, resulting in the formation of polynuclear complexes containing OH- bridges. 30 This is thought to occur by the loss of a proton from coordinated water, followed by coordination of the OH- to a second cation. The final product of this hydrolysis is hydrated chromium(III) oxide or chromic hydroxide (Cr(OH)3). The following equilibria are thus observed with increasing pH: The aqueous chemistry of the strongly reducing Cr2+ cation has not been as extensively studied because of its instability. Cr2+ ions are present in water as octahedral high-spin hexaquo ions, Cr(H2O)62+, and are unstable with respect to oxidation to Cr3+:
B. Molecular Structure of Cr in the Solid State
The principal chromium oxides are CrO3, CrO2, and Cr2O3, but some intermediate states, like Cr3O8, Cr2O5, and Cr5O12, have also been observed. 31,32 The red orthorhombic chromium trioxide (CrO3) crystals are made up of chains of corner-shared CrO4 tetrahedra. They lose oxygen upon heating to give a succession of lower oxides until the green Cr2O3 is formed. The latter oxide is the most stable oxide and has a spinel structure. The third major oxide of chromium is the brown-black, CrO2, which is an intermediate product in the decomposition of CrO3 to Cr2O3 and possesses a rutile structure.

Although Cr2+ ions are rare and unstable in terrestrial minerals, their presence is suspected in the blue minerals olivine and pyroxene. Cr2+ ions are frequently octahedrally coordinated, but tetrahedral Cr2+ exists in spinel-like minerals.
III. Characterization Methods
The characterization of the molecular structure of supported chromium ions is rather involved, since deposition of this metal ion on a support can result in (1) isolated chromium ions, (2) a two-dimensional chromium oxide overlayer, or (3) three-dimensional chromium oxide crystallites. Moreover, each phase can simultaneously possess several different molecular structures. Thus, useful characterization techniques, which can provide detailed information about the molecular structure of the supported chromium oxide, must be capable of discriminating between these different states and of quantifying the individual oxidation states. The spectra are complex and usually encompasses several overlapping bands, so that band decomposition routines and chemometrical techniques need to be employed. This is especially important if quantitative information is desired.

The given information about speciation concerns only the detectable oxidation states, while dispersion can be defined as the ratio of the amount of Cr probed by a particular characterization technique over the total amount present on the surface. Furthermore, the minimum detectable amounts are the minimum values reported in the literature. It is also important to state that the different characterization techniques are only quantitative under well-defined conditions. In the case of ESR, problems with quantification may arise if spinspin interactions or fast relaxation processes occur. The binding energies (BE), measured by XPS, increases with increasing oxidation state and for a fixed oxidation state with the electronegativity of the surrounding atoms. The BE values are also influenced by the degree of dispersion and bulk chromium oxides always exhibit lower BE values compared to Cr ions dispersed in inorganic oxides. As a result, the estimation of the valence states only from BE values is very difficult. In addition, highly dispersed Cr6+ and Cr5+ are readily reduced under high vacuum in the ESCA chamber and/or under influence of X-ray irradiation, and consequently complicating the estimation of the different oxidation states from XPS data.86,87 The five most applied spectroscopic characterization tools are ESR, DRS, RS, IR, and XPS, and their spectroscopic fingerprints of the observed Cr species are given in Table 2. 34-91 It is clear that no characterization technique will be capable of providing all the information needed for complete characterization. Thus, successful characterization of chromium in inorganic oxides requires a multitechnique approach.
IV. Molecular Structure of Cr on Oxidic Surfaces
A. Molecular Structure of Cr on Amorphous Oxides
The molecular structure of Cr on amorphous oxides is strongly dependent on the environmental conditions (hydrated, dehydrated, oxidized, and reduced environments) and on the type and composition of the support (SiO2, Al2O3, SiO2·Al2O3, MgO, ZrO2, TiO2, AlPO4, Nb2O5, and SnO2).
1. Hydrated Cr
Under hydrated conditions, the surface of an amorphous oxide is covered by a thin water film and its hydroxyl population is subject to pH-dependent equilibria reactions:3,4,92 with X = Si, Al, Ti, Mg, Nb, Sn or Zr; Hs+ and H+ represent the surface and solution proton, respectively; K1 = ([XOH]*[Hs+])/[XOH2+]; K2 = ([XO-]*[Hs+])/[XOH] and the isoelectric point (IEP) = (pK1 + pK2)/2 and represents the pH at which the surface of the oxide has a net zero charge. The IEP's are dependent on oxide type and composition as shown in Table 3. The lower the IEP of the amorphous oxide, the more the equilibria of the reactions 68 are driven to the right. The higher the H+ concentration near the surface, the more the equilibria of reactions 1 and 4 are driven toward the formation of dichromate and a Cr(H2O)63+ complex, respectively.Spectroscopic measurements on supports with low Cr6+ loadings, confirm these findings, and the obtained speciation is summarized in Table 3. DRS experiments show that the monochromate:dichromate ratio decreases with increasing Si:Al ratio of silica aluminas, while by Raman spectroscopy, monochromate is observed on MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2 and mainly polychromates (dichromate, etc.) on SiO2. As an example, Figure 4 shows the DRS and RS spectra of hydrated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts as a function of the Cr loading. Instead, Cr3+ species are difficult to discriminate on hydrated surfaces by spectroscopy and the different species of eq 4 cannot be clearly distinguished. In any case, the broad isotropic ESR signal around g = 2 and the typical DRS absorptions at around 17000 and 23000 cm-1 are indicative for the presence of hydrated octahedral Cr3+ complexes.Figure 4 DRS (A) and RS (B) spectra of hydrated Cr on an alumina surface for increasing Cr loading (Reprinted from ref 93. Copyright 1995 Royal Chemical Society.) When the Cr loading (as e.g. CrO3) increases two effects come into play: (1) the pH near the surface is lowered due to presence of chromium and decreases with increasing Cr loading and (2) the dispersion depends on the available surface area as well as availability of reactive surface hydroxyl groups. Both factors influence the chemistry of chromium in the same direction, i.e. toward the formation of surface polychromates. The detected Cr6+ species are described in Table 3, while Figure 5 illustrates the speciation of hydrated Cr on surfaces of amorphous supports. It is also important to stress that the presence of anions and cations (Na+, F-, etc.) on the surfaces can alter the isoelectric point of the supports and, consequently, the Cr speciation.Figure 5 Surface chemistry of hydrated Cr on amorphous surfaces, showing the relation between the polymerization degree of Cr on the one hand and the isoelectric point of the support and the Cr loading on the other hand (redrawn from ref 106).
2. Anchored Cr
Upon heating in air, the water molecules adsorbed on the support and around Cr are removed, while Cr3+ ions (if present) are oxidized to Cr6+. The formed dehydrated chromium oxide species do not decompose into O2 and Cr2O3 (like the pure compounds), at least for low Cr loadings, but are anchored by an esterification reaction with the hydroxyl groups of the inorganic oxide, resulting in the formation of surface Cr species. This is schematically drawn for Cr on alumina in Figure 6. Evidence for this anchorage reaction comes from the following: Figure 6 Anchoring reaction of chromate on an alumina support. Reaction of Cr with the hydroxyl groups and dehydroxylation process of the surface oxide (redrawn from ref 106).
(1) Infrared spectroscopy47,78,65 and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the near-infrared region, 93 indicating the consumption of OH groups. This OH consumption is proportional to the quantity of deposited Cr, and Turek et al.96 have shown that on alumina this OH consumption starts from the more basic OH groups to the more acidic groups.
(2) Experiments with CrO2Cl2 and silica, which show the release of HCl and the reverse reaction of dry HCl with calcined Cr/SiO2 with release of CrO2Cl2 vapor. 97-100 (3) The exothermal peak in DTA curves around 250 C, which is ascribed to this esterification reaction. 101 This anchorage process can be envisaged as an acidbase reaction because the weaker acid H2O is replaced by the stronger one H2CrO4. The reaction is therefore most pronounced on the more basic alumina. Furthermore, the most basic OH groups react preferentially, while the less basic OH groups only react at higher Cr loadings. Silica surfaces contain more acidic hydroxyl groups and have, therefore, a poor capacity for Cr anchoring. Consequently, Cr2O3 particles are frequently encountered on silica surfaces, even at very low Cr loadings.56-57 The molecular structure of the anchored Cr6+ is a strong point of discussion in the literature,6 and several molecular structures, starting from monochromate over dichromate to polychromate, are proposed. Many researchers have measured the change in hydroxyl population of a silica surface on anchoring of chromium: a monochromate species should react with two hydroxyls per Cr, while dichromate displaces only one per Cr. However, the results from this approach were extremely contradictory. Hogan11 and McDaniel97-100 concluded that CrO3 attaches mainly as monochromate, while Zecchina et al.48 and Krauss52 reported that dichromate was the dominant species. Others have tried to correlate the geometry of chromate and dichromate with models of amorphous supports.6 Although they show that dichromate is favored on silica, these kind of studies are too uncertain due to the lack of information about silica surfaces and the surfaces of amorphous supports in general. Furthermore, the oxide surfaces may become restructured upon the anchoring of Cr.
Direct information about the molecular structure can be found by the application of different spectroscopic techniques such as diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The molecular structures of a series of anchored chromium oxide catalysts on silica, alumina, titania, zirconia, niobia, and magnesia were systematically investigated with Raman, IR, and DRS after dehydration at 450550 C.62,64,65,94 For Cr/SiO2 (Cab-O-Sil, 300 m2/g), the dominant surface chromium oxide species detected by Raman and DRS was monochromate, but amounts of polychromate were also detected by DRS to be present at higher Cr loadings. However, for surface chromium oxide on alumina (Harshaw, 180 m2/g), the polychromate species was the major species detected by Raman and DRS, especially at high Cr loadings. This is illustrated in Figure 7 by some RS spectra of dehydrated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts with increasing Cr loading. Anchored chromium oxide species on titania (Degussa P-25, 55 m2/g), zirconia (Degussa, 39 m2/g), and niobia (Niobium Products Co., 37 m2/g) were predominantly present as polychromate species and gave similar Raman and IR vibrations to those observed for Cr/Al2O3. There is a general agreement that the surface monochromate species on silica possesses a dioxo structure, but there is still some uncertainty as to whether the surface polychromate species on the other oxide supports possesses a monooxo or dioxo structure.64 Hopefully, this issue can be resolved in the near future with oxygen isotope experiments. For Cr/MgO (Fluka Chemical Co., 80 m2/g), a solid solution is formed, rather than a surface chromium oxide species, due to the strong acidbase reaction between the acidic chromia and the strongly basic magnesia.61 Thus, the molecular structure of the surface chromium oxide species is strongly dependent on the surface properties of the oxide support, i.e. the surface hydroxyl chemistry and the available surface area.
Figure 7 RS spectra of calcined Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for increasing Cr loading. (Reprinted from ref 64. Copyright 1992 American Chemical Society).
The ratio of surface monochromate to polychromate species can be altered by changing the surface chemistry of the oxide surfaces. For example, the addition of submonolayer quantities of surface titania species to silica (Cab-O-Sil) enhances the concentration of surface polychromate species and results in comparable amounts of surface monochromate and polychromate species.67 The formation of a surface silica overlayer on titania (Degussa P-25) suppresses the concentration of surface polychromate species and increases the amounts of surface monochromate species.66 In addition, the surface chromium oxide species is also sensitive to the support type and more particularly to the specific preparation method. This is illustrated in the DRS spectra of Figure 8 which reveals that surface monochromate species is the dominant species on industrial pyrogenic silica (Cab-O-Sil, 300 m2/g) and that surface polychromate species is the dominant species on laboratory sol-gel silica (700 m2/g). The ratio of surface polychromate to monochromate species can also be varied for the sol-gel supports by altering the Si:Al ratio and increases with increasing Si:Al ratio and Cr loading. Thus, on alumina mainly monochromate is formed, although at high Cr loadings (around 8 wt % Cr) dichromates are formed; while on silica surfaces, polychromates dominate over monochromates. Consequently, the molecular structure of Cr not only depends on the Cr loading, the support composition, but also on the surface chemistry of the oxide support which may be further modified by the preparation and calcination procedures. These dependencies explain why the data in the literature are sometimes difficult to compare and only by a combination of different spectroscopic techniques can detailed molecular-level information be obtained. In light of our current understanding, it is not surprising there has been such confusion for the last 30 years on the molecular structure of supported Cr on dehydrated surfaces.6 Figure 8 DRS spectra of calcined Cr/SiO2 catalysts for increasing Cr loading. (A) Industrially prepared pyrogenic silica and (B) solgel method based silica. (Part A: redrawn from ref 94. (Part B: Reprinted from ref 93. Copyright 1995 Royal Chemical Society.) In addition to the chromates, Cr5+ ions and Cr2O3 clusters can also be formed on calcined surfaces and their relative amount is support, loading, and treatment dependent. The Cr5+ ions are easily detectable by ESR as the γ signal. Although this γ signal is generally attributed to Cr5+ in square-pyramidal or distorted tetrahedral coordination,34-37 some researchers insist that it involves a combination of Cr6+ and Cr3+ (i.e. a Zener double exchange system). 102-104 Detailed ESR studies of Cr 45- and of Cr53-enriched supported Cr systems,36,105,46 and SQUID measurements 106 reject this hypothesis and show that Cr5+ is present as an isolated paramagnetic ion, following the CurieWeiss law down to 10 K. Only between 10 and 4.5 K were antiferromagnetic features observed and consequently the CurieWeiss plot deviates from linearity.106 Cr2O3 formation can be studied by DRS, ESR, RS, and XRD and is the most pronounced on silica-rich supports with a high Cr loading and after heating at high temperature with a high heating rate. Thus, as the chromium loading increases, almost all is stabilized in the hexavalent state until a certain saturation coverage is reached, because Cr titrates the surface hydroxyls, which depends on the calcination procedure.98-100 Beyond this limit, excess Cr is converted to Cr2O3. Finally, techniques like N2 adsorption and XPS are used to determine the dispersion of Cr. Fouad et al. showed by N2 adsorption measurements that the dispersion of Cr is the lowest on silica and the highest on alumina surfaces. 107 In addition, Scierka et al. proved by XPS that Cr is highly dispersed on an alumina surface and ISS results on the same catalysts show that the Cr phase covers only a small fraction of the alumina surface. 108 In conclusion, Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr2O3 clusters are formed on calcined surfaces, and their relative amounts and coordination geometries strongly depend on the support type and composition, the Cr loading, and heat treatment.
3. Reduced Cr
The reduction process of Cr and speciation of reduced Cr on amorphous supports have been extensively investigated by several spectroscopic and chemical techniques (mainly DRS, IR, ESR, EXAFS-XANES, XPS, and TPR). In general, three oxidation states, Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cr5+, are formed from Cr6+, with different coordination geometries and amounts.
DRS spectroscopy48,56-58 show the presence of three new species: (pseudo-) octahedral Cr2+, (pseudo-) tetrahedral Cr2+, and (pseudo-) octahedral Cr3+, their relative concentration depending on the treatment and the support composition. The spectroscopic fingerprints of these reduced Cr species are summarized in Table 2. In principle, Cr5+ could also be detected by DRS, but the amounts are too small for detection.IR and EXAFS spectroscopies69-72,93 show that a fraction of the Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions possess a low coordination number and because the latter technique only reveals a mean coordination environment, it is less informative. Instead, IR spectroscopy has shown to be a very powerful technique due to its ability to discriminate between different surface Cr2+ species.69-85 This is illustrated in Figure 9 for CO reduced Cr/SiO2 catalysts.77 Three families of anchored Cr2+ ions have been singled out (labeled as A, B, and C), after chemisorption of CO. These three species differ in their degree of coordinative unsaturation (A < B < C) and consequently in their propensity to react (A > B > C). The corresponding CO IR bands are given in Table 2. It is also important to stress that IR is indirect since it cannot probe Cr sites directly.Figure 9 IR spectra of adsorbed CO on a reduced Cr/SiO2 catalyst and schematic interpretation. Equilibrium pressures: curve 1, 40 torr; curve 2, 0.4 torr; curve 3, 0.2 torr; curve 4, 6 min pumping. (Reprinted from ref 75. Copyright 1988 Elsevier Science Publishers.) Three different Cr species can be detected with ESR:34-47 isolated Cr5+ species, clustered Cr3+, and dispersed Cr3+. These three species are usually denoted as γ-signal, β-signal, and δ-signal, respectively, and the spectroscopic characteristics are summarized in Table 2. A typical example of an X-band ESR spectrum is shown in Figure 10 for a supported Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.46 The γ-signal can be present under different coordinations, depending on the support composition. This is illustrated in Table 4. Two main Cr5+ coordinations, with slightly different ESR parameters, are observed: i.e. square-pyramidal and pseudotetrahedral coordination. The β-signal is an isotropic signal, which is mainly present on reduced alumina surfaces, and its g value and line width strongly depend on the reduction temperature and Cr loading.46 The δ-signal is a special one because it has only a strong and broad positive lobe around g = 3.55.5. This signal, which follow the CurieWeiss law, can be simulated by using high zero field parameters D and E, which mean that is due to an isolated strongly distorted Cr3+ octahedron.46,47,106 Figure 10 X-band ESR spectrum of a supported Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.

Finally, chemical techniques, like TPR measurements, can be used to unravel the overall chemistry of the reduction process of supported Cr catalysts. 109,110 Recent TPR measurements on a series of supported Cr/SiO2·Al2O3 catalysts with different SiO2 content show that the mean oxidation state of Cr after reduction increases with increasing alumina content and Cr loading.93 Thus, mainly Cr2+ and Cr3+ are formed on silica and alumina surfaces, respectively, while silica aluminas possess an intermediate Cr2+:Cr3+ ratio on their surface.In summary, by reduction Cr6+ is converted to Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, each in different coordination environments and amounts. On silica, the Cr2+ species is the main species, and three main families, differing in their degree of coordinative unsaturation, have been detected.
B. Molecular Structure of Cr on Molecular Sieves
Chromium-containing molecular sieves can be prepared in three different ways: (1) by ion exchange with an aqueous chromium solution or by solid-state ion exchange using an appropriate chromium salt; (2) by impregnation with a chromium solution; and (3) by hydrothermal synthesis of a molecular sieve in the presence of different chromium salts.106 The surface chemistry of Crn+ (with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) in molecular sieves is somewhat similar, regardless of the Cr loading, the type of immobilization, the molecular sieve structure type, and composition. This can be deduced from Tables 5 and 6, where the reported DRS and ESR results are presented, respectively. The studied molecular sieves are zeolite A, X, and Y; mordenite; ZSM-5; silicalite, and AlPO's. Two review papers have appeared in the literature about Cr molecular sieves: Kucherov and Slinkin recently reviewed their work about Cr in high-silica zeolites,132 while a more general review was made in the early 1970s by Kazanskii and co-workers.118
1. Chromium Ion-Exchanged and -Impregnated Molecular Sieves
After ion exchange and impregnation, Cr3+ or Cr2+ ions are present as hexaaquo complexes in the cages and channels of molecular sieves. This is illustrated by the DRS spectrum of a freshly prepared Cr3+ zeolite in Figure 11, and the corresponding absorption bands are given in Table 5. Drying of these materials results in a decrease of the ligand field strength of the Cr(H2O)63+ complex, as evidenced by the red shift of the dd bands (Figure 11). This lowering is due to two phenomena: (a) the removal of water from the second coordination sphere of chromium and (b) the replacement of one (or more) water molecule(s) in the first coordination sphere of the Cr3+ ion by a weaker ligand, e.g. the lattice oxygen of the molecular sieve.125 This process can be visualized, for Cr3+-exchanged molecular sieves (MS), in the following way: The location and nature of the Cr3+ complexes after impregnation of the molecular sieve or after mixing of the molecular sieve with a chromium salt (for solid-state ion exchange) is not known, but appreciable quantitities of Cr may be on the external surface of the molecular sieve.106 Figure 11 DRS spectra of hydrated and dried Cr exchanged zeolite Y (with Ga substituted for Al): (A) freshly prepared and (B) after drying.

Recently, the group of Zecchina has shown that nests of hydroxyl groups inside silicalite molecular sieves can react with chromic acid to give anchored (grafted) monochromate and/or dichromate and this reaction must also occur upon calcination of Cr-exchanged or -impregnated molecular sieves.133,134 Finally, considerable amounts of dichromate and polychromates are observed on impregnated Cr molecular sieves, where Cr6+ ions are partially located at the external surface of the molecular sieve crystals.106 Table 6.

The two same coordination environments as for amorphous supports are proposed: square pyramidal and pseudotetrahedral. The Cr5+ species in mordenite-type molecular sieves are an interesting example since it is characterized by a complex ESR spectrum (Figure 12) possessing two rhombic signals with one exhibiting aluminum superhyperfine splitting (species B). The simulated spectrum, together with the individual components A and B, is also shown in Figure 12, and is very close to the experimental one.106,47 Species A is assigned to Cr5+ ions present at the junction between the main channel and the side pocket, while species B is located near a framework aluminum in the main channel of mordenite molecular sieves.129 Figure 12 ESR spectra of calcined Cr mordenite: (A) experimental spectrum; (B) overall simulated spectrum (by an appropriate summation of the spectra of species A and B); (C) simulated spectrum of species A; and (D) simulated spectrum of species B. (Reprinted from ref 47. Copyright 1996 Royal Chemical Society.) These Cr6+ and Cr5+ complexes are reducible to pseudooctahedral Cr3+ and pseudotetrahedral and pseudooctahedral Cr2+, depending on the preparation method, treatment, and the molecular sieve type and composition. The DRS absorption bands of reduced Cr molecular sieves are included in Table 5 and are somewhat similar to those observed for reduced Cr on amorphous supports. For a state of the art of the chemistry and spectroscopy of solid-state ion-exchanged Cr molecular sieves, we refer to a recent review of Kucherov and Slinkin.132 Quantum-chemical calculations were used by the group of Wichterlova for the calculation of the physicochemical properties of Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+ at site II (supercage) in faujasite zeolites, modeled by Si3Al3O6(OH)12Cr clusters.135 They show that the Cr ions are bonded to the molecular sieve skeleton by electron donoracceptor bonds whose formation lead to electron donation from the skeleton to the cation, thus stabilizing the valence states of the Cr ions. The most probable valence state of the Cr ions in the zeolites was found to be Cr3+; however, it can readily be oxidized to Cr5+ and Cr6+. These ions were found to exhibit high electronacceptor ability and thus are easily reduced away.
Detailed information about the coordination environment of Crn+ in zeolites X, Y, and A has been obtained by using nitric oxide as a chemical probe and the obtained chromiumnitrosyl complexes were characterized by a combined IR-ESR spectroscopies. In the 1970s, Naccache and Taarit and Chambellan et al. showed that Cr3+ exchanged zeolites can be either oxidized to Cr5+ by oxygen or reduced by H2 or CO to mainly Cr2+.121,122 The latter species forms stable NO complexes of the type CrINO+, i.e. mononitrosyl complexes of Cr2+, giving rise to axial ESR signals with g = 1.977 and g = 1.8461.917. Pearce et al. have reinvestigated these systems and concluded that their IR and ESR parameters are typical for a CrIII(NO)2 species, i.e. a dinitrosyl complex of Cr3+.113 Molecular orbital calculations on several model systems support this assignment.
In conclusion, the surface chemistry of Cr on zeolitic surfaces is quite similar to that observed for amorphous supports as the same coordination environments and oxidation states are revealed by spectroscopy.
2. Hydrothermally Synthesized, Chromium-Containing Molecular Sieves
The synthesis and characterization of chromium-substituted molecular sieves have only recently received special attention from researchers working in the field of molecular sieve science. Consequently, only a limited number of detailed papers123-126,130-131,137-141 and some patents 142-143 have appeared in the literature, which report the synthesis and characterization of Cr-containing AlPO's (CrAPO-n) and silicalite (Cr silicalite) materials. The applied characterization techniques for studying these crystalline materials are XRD, SEM, DRS, ESR, NMR, and IR.The key question here is if Cr3+ really substitutes in the framework of molecular sieves and to what extent. Isomorphous substitution requires tetrahedral Cr3+, which is difficult to obtain because of the high crystal field stabilization energies of octahedral Cr3+ complexes. This is evidenced by the scarcity of tetrahedral Cr3+ complexes and the absence of reported inorganic structures with tetrahedral Cr3+.106 In the acid synthesis gels of CrAPO-5 molecular sieves,125 Cr is present as an octahedral Craquo complex (for Cr3+) or chromate and polychromate (for Cr6+). In the case of Cr silicalite gels, which have a basic pH, the Cr3+ ions are present as polymerized octahedrally coordinated ions and as chromate anions for Cr6+. Thus, the same chemistry is revealed in the synthesis gels as in aqueous solutions. Consequently, these ions are in the liquid phase of the gel and can be easily washed off.During and after hydrothermal synthesis, Cr is present as Cr3+ in (pseudo-) octahedral coordination to oxygen.125-126 This is illustrated in Figures 13 and 14 by some DRS and ESR spectra of as-synthesized CrAPO-5 molecular sieves. DRS shows two absorption bands at 15900 and 21800 cm-1, while in X-band and Q-band ESR an intense and broad signal around g = 2 is detected. Both observations are characteristic of the presence of Cr3+ ions, surrounded by six oxygen ligands in octahedral coordination. Besides this signal, a broad and positive lobe around g = 4 is observed. This signal has some similarities with the δ-signal on amorphous supports and can be simulated by using high zero field parameters D and E. In view of the work on Cr silicalite of Nakamura et al.,130 lattice-substituted Cr3+ cannot be excluded. Also Mosser et al. 144 and Gaite and Mosser 145 have shown that pseudooctahedral Cr3+ in kaolinite materials gives a g = 4.0 signal.Figure 13 DRS spectra of as-synthesized CrAPO-5 molecular sieves with increasing Cr content: 0.75 Et3N.

Copyright 1996 Royal Chemical Society.) Upon calcination, this Cr3+ is oxidized to mainly monochromate/polychromate and some Cr5+, while reduction results in the formation of (pseudo-) octahedral Cr3+, (pseudo-) octahedral Cr2+ and (pseudo-) tetrahedral Cr2+.125-126 In the case of calcined Crsilicalite, Cr can be easily washed off from the crystalline material, suggesting a weak interaction between silicalite and Cr and a high solubility of Cr in the aqueous phase.123 Although several authors123-124,130-131 claim the isomorphous substitution of Cr in molecular sieves, no spectroscopic signatures of lattice substituted Cr have been available up to now in the literature. Only for CrAPO-14, an aluminophosphate with octahedral framework sites, is it clearly shown by single crystal XRD measurements that 45% of the octahedral sites are occupied by Cr3+ ions.137
V. Quantitation of Cr Species on Oxidic Surfaces
From the previous section it can be concluded that a qualitative picture of the surface chemistry of Cr emerges by applying different complementary characterization techniques. However, if one ever wants to develop structure/compositionreactivity relationships, quantitative measurements are necessary. Therefore, we have recently developed a novel spectroscopic method for the quantitation of Crn+ species (with n = 2, 3, 5, and 6) in inorganic oxides.46,56-57,120,126 The general approach of this method and the different steps in the quantitation are shown in Figure 15. The method is based on a detailed analysis of DRS and ESR spectra, which were taken as a function of one parameter (reduction temperature, Cr loading, or support composition). In a second step, the obtained spectra were decomposed into their individual components, belonging to a particular oxidation state. Chemometric techniques (e.g. SIMPLISMA, simple to use interactive self-modeling mixture analysis) and ESR simulations are useful in this respect because they are able to verify the presence of each proposed pure spectrum. In a final step, the individual oxidation states are quantified.
Figure 15 Combined DRS-ESR method for the quantitation of different Cr oxidation states: (A) overview of the combined quantitative DRSESR method; (B) quantitative DRS, and (C) quantitative ESR.
The application of this method on the DRS and ESR spectra of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts as a function of the reduction temperature is shown in Figure 16. DRS spectroscopy reveal three pure species: chromate, octahedral Cr3+, and octahedral Cr2+, whereas with ESR square-pyramidal Cr5+ is detected. This is shown in Figure 16, parts II and III. The calibration lines for Cr6+ and Cr3+ on alumina are given in Figure 16IV. The calibration line for Cr6+ is almost linear, while the Cr3+ calibration line is curved. Quantitation, which is only accurate between 0 and 0.4 wt % Cr, gives the concentration of Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ after different pretreatments. This is illustrated in Figure 16V. After calcination Cr6+ is the dominant species and only traces of Cr5+ are present. After reduction, Cr6+ is converted to mainly Cr3+ and some Cr5+ and Cr2+. In any case, the highest detected amounts of Cr5+ are only 23% of the total Cr content.46 Upon recalcination, Crn+ is partially reoxidized to Cr6+ and a considerable amount is stabilized under Cr2O3 form or dissolved in the alumina support.56 Figure 16 Application of the combined DRS-ESR method on the spectra of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts as a function of reduction temperature: (I) Series of DRS spectra with increasing reduction temperature [reduction at 200 C (A); 300 C (B); 400 C (C) and 600 C (D)]; (II) deconvoluted diffuse reflectance spectra (same abbrevations as under I); (III) experimental (A) and simulated (B) ESR spectrum of Cr5+ on alumina; (IV) DRS calibration lines of Cr6+ and Cr3+; (V) distribution of Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ ions on alumina as a function of pretreatment [(A) calcination at 550 C; (B) reduction at 200 C; (C) reduction at 300 C, (D) reduction at 400 C; (E) reduction at 600 C; and (F) recalcination at 550 C]. (Reprinted from refs 46 and 56. Copyright 1995 and 1993 American Chemical Society, respectively.) The developed method is also applicable to Cr/SiO2 and Cr/SiO2·Al2O3 catalysts, at least for low Cr loadings (<0.2 wt % Cr), but the analysis is always less accurate due to the coexistence of many coordination and oxidation states of Cr. Comparison between the different amorphous supports indicates that the Cr2+:Cr3+ ratio increases with increasing silica content of the support. Thus, silica-rich surfaces prefer Cr2+ ions, while on alumina mainly Cr3+ is present.56-57 The same general trend is observed for chromium-containing molecular sieves: Cr6+ ions are more easily reduced to Cr3+/2+ in silica-rich than in alumina-rich and galium-rich molecular sieves.120 All these observations are in line with TPR investigations on the same set of samples.93 Thus, an average oxidation number of 2 and 3 was obtained after reduction for silica and alumina surfaces, respectively. Silica aluminas have an intermediate behavior. These differences in redox behavior can be explained in terms of hardness and softness, first introduced by Pearson. 146 Chemically softer oxides (silicon-rich) facilitate reduction of Cr (more Cr2+ after reduction), while chemically harder oxides (aluminum- and gallium-rich) retard reduction (more Cr3+ after reduction). This explanation has been proven recently by electronegativity equalization method based calculations. 147 It is also important to stress here that the amount of ESR visible Cr5+ ions on oxidic surfaces never exceeds more than 3% of the total Cr content, independent of the oxidic composition and structure, the Cr loadings and the applied treatment.46,106,126 The amount of Cr5+ on oxidic surfaces can be maximized by applying low Cr loadings and relatively low reduction treatments, and by using alumina-rich silica alumina oxides.46 An example of the introduction of chemometric techniques 106,148 in spectral analysis is given in Figure 17 for DRS spectra of hydrated Cr/SiO2·Al2O3 catalysts as a function of the SiO2 content. Four pure spectra are revealed in the spectra of the supported Cr catalysts: component A with three characteristic bands at 20300, 30600, and 44100 cm-1; component B with three bands at 24900, 36600, and 45500 cm-1; component C appeared at 17700 cm-1, and component D absorbs in the region 286003700049000 cm-1. Components A and B are due to chromate and dichromate, respectively, and their relative ratio increases with decreasing silica content of the support. Component C is assigned to pseudooctahedrally coordinated Cr3+, while component D is a support band. The same analysis can be successfully applied on calcined and reduced supported Cr catalysts,106,148 and the same kind of information is obtained as with spectral decomposition routines.Figure 17 SIMPLISMA approach applied on DRS spectra of hydrated Cr/SiO2·Al2O3 catalysts: (I) series of DRS spectra of supported Cr catalysts with different SiO2 content; (II) pure spectra of dichromate (A), chromate (B), Cr3+ (C), and support (D); (III) chromate:dichromate ratio on silica aluminas as a function of the Si:Al ratio for hydrated () and dehydrated (·) catalysts. (Redrawn from ref 106.) Thus, a set of spectroscopic and mathematical tools have become available in the literature, which allows one to tackle not only the speciation of Cr, but also to quantify the different oxidation states of Cr at least for low Cr loadings. Higher Cr loadings are better studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and a quantitative method has been developed by the group of Hercules and Houalla. This approach, based on the extensive use of chemometrical techniques, has been reviewed recently by Hercules et al.90
VI. Mobility and Surface Reactivity of Cr on Oxidic Surfaces
A. Mobility of Supported Cr
Chromium ions are often considered as contaminants in waste waters and in waste products of industries because of its use in various industrial processes: e.g. Cr3+ ions in waste waters and solid wastes of leather tanning manufacturers and Cr6+ ions in waters of cooling towers.8,9 The released ions are then immobilized in or on sediments/soils or taken up by microorganisms, plants, and animals.5 The latter phenomenon is especially important because of the toxicity of Cr. To solve these problems, Cr wastes are often concentrated from waste waters or directly used for incorporation in cements. The obtained waste containers are then stored in disposal sites. However, the immobilized chromium can be leached out by degradation of the cement matrices. Recent results on cementing of Cr show that (1) Cr3+ ions are better retained in cement matrices than Cr6+, the leaching of which is a serious problem and (2) Cr retention is improved by addition of aluminum. Cr3+ ions, released in the environment, are adsorbed on soil constituents, while the highly mobile Cr6+ ions can be leached out and contaminate ground and surface waters.2,5 On the other hand, the presence of Cr in the feed of chemical reactors may deteriorate and/or inactivate heterogeneous catalysts, like fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, by migration of Cr toward catalytically active sites at high temperature or structural breakdown. 149 All these studies show that Cr ions are mobile on hydrated and dehydrated surfaces with some preference for some inorganic oxides above others. This was recently confirmed by chemical analysis and by spectroscopy on Cr loaded silica, alumina, zeolite Y, and mordenite. 67,150 In dilute solution, silica and alumina have only a small affinity for Cr, be it either Cr3+ and Cr6+. Molecular sieves show, however, a high preference for Cr3+ due to ion exchange, but the amount of Cr6+ taken up by these materials is always low. This is, of course, due to the cation exchange properties of molecular sieves.
Interesting results were obtained by mixing Cr3+/6+ oxide materials with an an equal amount of an unloaded support. After calcination, the position of Cr was evaluated by DRS (Cr6+ and Cr3+), RS (Cr6+), and ESR (Cr5+).67,150 For example, the DRS and ESR spectra of Cr/Al2O3, mixed with silica and alumina, and Cr/SiO2, mixed with alumina and mordenite are presented in Figures 18 and 19, respectively. Figure 18 shows that Cr5+ and Cr6+ are always present on alumina, independently of the mixed oxide. The situation is different for Cr/SiO2. After mixing with alumina, Cr5+ and Cr6+ are located on alumina, while with mordenite, spectra of Cr characteristic for both supports, are obtained. From such studies it was concluded that Cr5+ and Cr6+ ions migrate from silica to alumina and to a lesser extent to zeolites. Little migration of Cr5+/Cr6+ from alumina to zeolites and vice versa is observed. The latter is indicative of the formation of stable coordination complexes on alumina and zeolites.

In summary, the following preference sequences are obtained for Cr3+, alumina  molecular sieve  silica; and for Cr6+, alumina  molecular sieve  silica.
B. Surface Reactivity of Supported Cr
Supported Cr ions show reactivity toward various molecules, as outlined in Figure 20. Three types of interaction can take place: (1) redox reactions, (2) coordinative adsorption, and (3) hydrolysis/condensation reactions.
Figure 20 Overview of the surface reactivity and the different types of interaction between organic and inorganic molecules and supported Cr.
Reduction/oxidation and hydrolysis/condensation reactions happen when anchored Cr6+ ions are exposed to several molecules. DRS measurements on calcined Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 materials show that interaction with (weak) acids, like ethanol and propanol, results in hydrolysis and reduction, while (weak) bases give only reduction.58 With ethylene, CO and H2, Cr2+ is the dominant species on silica, while on alumina Cr3+ is preferentially formed.58 The obtained reduced Crn+ species (with n = 2, 3, or 5) can be either saturated or unsaturated, and the latter will readily chemisorb different molecules, like ammonia, water, olefins, alcohols, ethers, CO, and NO.69-72,151-155,52,35,41,113 The interaction between Cr5+ and ammonia, ethylene, and water has been extensively investigated by ESR.36,41 Upon adsorption of small water doses on Cr/SiO2, pseudotetrahedral Cr5+ (coordination number of 4) is converted to a square-planar Cr5+ (coordination number of 5) and octahedral Cr5+ (coordination number of 6). The same results are obtained with ethylene instead of water.41 In the presence of excess water, the chromyl species on silica becomes unstable at elevated temperature, undergoing disproportionation to Cr3+ and Cr6+.36 On adsorption of ammonia, square-pyramidal Cr5+ is formed from pseudotetrahedral Cr5+. Similar reactions take place on other supports, like alumina, titania, and zirconia.36 Detailed DRS studies on the interaction between water, alcohol, and ether molecules and silica-supported Cr2+ ions were carried out by Krauss and co-workers.52-53,151-155 They show that a coordinative unsaturated Cr2+ ion can be easily converted to its coordinative saturated counterpart by introducing various molecules. Finally, CO and NO can chemisorb on reduced Cr sites and IR spectroscopy may be used to discriminate between the different coordination geometries, as outlined in the characterization part. In addition, the interaction between supported Cr2+ and ethylene can be followed by IR spectroscopy. Detailed IR studies were carried out by the group of Zecchina70-72,75-76,85,133-134 and by Rebenstorf and co-workers.79-83 Finally, oxygen causes reoxidation of reduced Cr to Cr6+ with a bright chemiluminescence.11,158 The intensity of this yellow-orange light flash decreases with increasing reduction temperature of the catalyst, increasing alumina content of the support, and decreasing initial calcination temperature.106 This chemiluminescence has an orange emission line at 615.8 nm and is due to oxygen atoms (O*), which are formed on coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+ sites.106 In conclusion, supported Cr ions are very reactive and readily interact with various organic and and inorganic molecules. These properties make such materials excellent catalysts for oxidation, hydrogenationdehydrogenation, and polymerization reactions.
VII. Catalysis of Cr on Oxidic Surfaces
A. Oxidation Reactions
The oxidation of organic compounds is a key reaction in inorganic synthesis and traditionally such reactions were performed with stoichiometric amounts of hexavalent chromium salts.159 However, the Cr6+ oxidant is usually not regenerated and the associated high costs and toxic effluents result in serious drawbacks, especially on an industrial scale. Consequently, because of the ease of regeneration and recycling of heterogeneous catalysts, much attention has been focused in the last decade on the use of heterogeneous chromium catalysts in oxidation reactions. Furthermore, these catalysts are investigated for the catalytic removal of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and chlorinated hydrocarbons from exhaust gases.
Supported chromium catalysts have been used for the oxidation of benzophenone22 (Cr/Al2O3), diphenylmethane22 (Cr/Al2O3), ethanol160 (Cr/SiO2), and methanol.61,62,67 The oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde was systematically investigated over a series of supported chromium oxide catalysts differing in support composition.61,62 The surface chromium oxide species were found to be active for methanol oxidation, while the crystalline Cr2O3 particles were essentially inactive for methanol oxidation.61 The reactivity of the surface chromium oxide species per Cr site per second, turnover frequency (TOF), on the different oxide supports toward redox products was found to vary by approximately a factor of 103: zirconia (1.3 × 100 s-1), titania (3 × 10-1 s-1), silica (1.6 × 10-1 s-1), niobia (5.8 × 10-2 s-1), and alumina (1.6 × 10-3 s-1). The characterization studies revealed that the same surface chromium oxide species are present on the zirconia, niobia, titania, and alumina supports, and thus, these differences in TOF were not associated with structural changes of the surface chromium oxide species. In addition, changing the ratio of the surface chromate to polychromate species by incorporation of surface titania to silica also did not alter the TOF.67 The dramatic change in the methanol oxidation TOF is due to the influence of the oxide support ligands which regulate the redox properties of the surface chromium oxide species. It has been proposed that this difference in reactivity is associated with the bridging CrOsupport bond and generally reflects the reducibility of the oxide support.62 The selectivity toward formaldehyde during methanol oxidation was dependent on the specific oxide support and surface coverage of the Cr species. Supports possessing strong Lewis acid surface sites, alumina > niobia, were responsible for the formation of significant quantities of the byproduct dimethyl ether. Supports possessing weak Lewis acid surface sites or redox surface sites, zirconia > titania > silica, were responsible for the formation of significant quantities of the byproduct methyl formate. The formation of byproducts by the oxide supports could be reduced by increasing the surface coverage of the Cr species. In the case of Cr/SiO2, methyl formate formation could be suppressed by reducing the surface concentration of hydroxyls via high-temperature calcination since these sites were required for the adsorption of methanol and its subsequent reaction with Cr-generated formaldehyde to form methylformate.60 A formaldehyde selectivity of approximately 90% could be obtained with Cr/SiO2 catalysts that had been precalcined at 700 C.61 Calcined chromium aluminophosphate molecular sieves (CrAPO-5) are active in the selective oxidation of various secondary alcohols (cyclohexanol, ethylbenzyl alcohol, methylbenzyl alcohol, tetralol, and indanol), using either molecular oxygen or tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. Recently, Chen and Sheldon have shown that a CrAPO-5 material acts as a heterogeneous recyclable catalyst for the liquid-phase autoxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone.124 Similarly, tetralin and indan were selectively oxidized to 1-tetralone and 1-indanone, respectively. In all these reactions Cr6+, as anchored chromate, is proposed as the active oxidation state and the autoxidation mechanism involves an initial free radical autoxidation of the hydrocarbons followed by a selective CrAPO-5-catalyzed intramolecular, heterolytic decomposition of the secondary alkyl hydroperoxide intermediate to the corresponding ketone and water. Recently, Wang et al. found that calcined Cr/MgO materials catalyze the synthesis of 2,6-dimethylphenol from methanol and cyclohexanol at atmospheric pressure.161 The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 is the most commonly used method for controlling emissions of oxides of nitrogen from power stations and various materials have been examined for their catalytic performances. The most intensively studies catalysts are based on V/TiO2, while supported chromium catalysts have received less attention. Nhyama et al. have studied the catalytic activities of various Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.26-28 The significant N2O production, however, above 197 C made these catalysts unsuitable for technical applications. Amorphous chromia are also effective to reduce NO selectively to N2, whereas with crystalline chromia (α-Cr2O3) formation of N2 and N2O occurred together with significant NH3 oxidation, the latter especially at higher temperatures.24,162 Recently, a series of titania-supported chromium catalysts were investigated and were found to be active in SCR reactions below 197 K.25 The NO conversion rate was proportional to the chromia loading up to 5 wt %. Higher loadings resulted in a less efficient use of the chromia species. However, in general, these Cr/TiO2 catalysts exhibited a TOF that was approximately a factor of 2 lower than comparable V/TiO2 catalysts which are employed industrially for this reaction. The selectivity toward N2 production was approximately 80% for the Cr/TiO2 catalysts and is approximately 100% for the corresponding V/TiO2 catalysts under the same reaction conditions. The N2 selectivity exceeded 90% when the catalysts received a hydrogen pretreatment at 447 C. Thus, the Cr/TiO2 catalysts are active for the SCR reaction, but are not as selective as the industrial V/TiO2.
Heterogeneous chromium catalysts are also active in the oxidation of hydrocarbons. The performances of Cr zeolites in this type of reactions has been reviewed by Tagiev and Minachev.163 In a recent study, Cr/SiO2 catalysts were compared with V/SiO2 and Mo/SiO2 systems for the oxidation of methane.164 The Cr/SiO2 catalyst was found to be the most active catalyst for methane oxidation (Cr > V > Mo). However, the oxidation of methane over the Cr/SiO2 catalyst resulted in complete combustion of methane, whereas the V/SiO2 and Mo/SiO2 catalysts yielded significant amounts of formaldehyde. In addition, heterogeneous chromium catalysts are active in the oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons, like methylene chloride.19-20 Chatterjee and Greene have compared H-Y, Ce-Y, and Cr-Y molecular sieves for the vapor-phase oxidation of CH2Cl2 in excess air between 300 and 500 C.19 The conversions varied from 17 to 99% and the catalytic activity decreases in the order: Cr-Y > H-Y > Ce-Y, while the selectivity among the catalysts was quite similar, with HCl and CO being the major products. In another paper, the same group compared Co-Y, Cr-Y, and Mn-Y catalysts for the catalytic oxidation of methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and carbon tetrachloride.20 They show, however, that Co-Y was superior to the Cr-Y catalyst.
B. HydrogenationDehydrogenation Reactions
Supported chromium oxide catalysts are extensively studied for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is especially of great industrial importance because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons.15 The catalytic performances of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation was discovered by Frey and Huppke in 1933 165-166 and is generally known as the Houdry catalyst. 167 This catalyst catalyzes the conversion of e.g. propane to propene, butane to butadiene, and ethylbenzene to styrene at relatively high temperature (450700 C) and low pressure (15 bar). Because of the different side reactions (cracking and coking), due to the alumina support, the catalyst is easily deactivated and, consequently, regeneration is required. Multiple catalyst beds permit dehydrogenation to take place continuously and typical Cr loadings are above 5 wt %. Details about the surface chemistry of these materials can be found in the review of Poole and MacIver. 168 Recently, the group of Indovina has studied the activity of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.15 They have shown that mononuclear Cr3+ species are the active centers, whereas surface oxygens adjacent to this Cr3+ ion are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site.
The same type of catalysts can be used for hydrogenation reactions, but due to thermodynamical reasons, these reactions require low temperature and relatively high pressures. Important contributions in this field were made in the 1960s by Selwood 169-171 and Burwell et al. 172-180 These authors investigated the catalytic properties of pure Cr2O3, Cr/Al2O3, and Cr/SiO2. Burwell and co-workers discussed in a series of papers the properties of a chromium oxide gel in the hydrogenation of various olefins. In addition, isotopic exchange experiments, the addition of deuterium to olefins, and the elucidation of the stereochemistry of the hydrogenation reactions are presented. From his work Burwell proposed a model for the mechanism of the reaction.172-180 The site was supposed to consist of a Cr3+ cation and an oxygen anion, the Cr3+ cation being accessible from the gas phase because it was situated next to a surface anion vacancy. Hydrogen was assumed to become adsorbed by heterolytical fission with the hydride ion becoming connected to the cation in the surface anion vacancy and the proton being bonded by oxygen. The olefin subsequently formed a carbanion by reaction with the hydride ion, and the final reaction is the combination of the carbanion and the proton to form the paraffin. Cr/Al2O3, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/MgO have also been studied by other authors for the hydrogenation of propene and H2D2 equilibration.14,16,181-183 Selwood 184 suggested that Cr3+ ions are the active sites for catalytic hydrogendeuterium equilibration over α-Cr2O3, whereas Indovina et al. have shown that the activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts is linked to the presence of Cr2+ ions.170 However, Wittgen et al. have shown that exhaustively reduced Cr/SiO2 catalysts, which contain predominantly Cr2+, are inactive and Cr3+ is proposed as the active site.14,16 More recently, Indovina and co-workers have studied the performances of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in propene hydrogenation as a function of the reduction treatment. 185-186 The catalytic activity increases when the average oxidation state of Cr decreases from 5.5 to about 3. Furthermore, reduced Cr/ZrO2 catalysts were 3.6 to 100 times more active than Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, and mononuclear Cr3+, formed from the reduction of isolated Cr5+, is proposed as the active center.
In summary, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions can be conducted over supported chromium catalysts, but active catalysts can only be obtained after some pretreatment, an evacuation or a passage of an inert gas over the catalyst at high temperature, which is probably connected with the necessity to create surface anion vacancies. Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are industrially important in dehydrogenation reactions.
C. Polymerization Reactions
Cr/SiO2 catalysts have been intensively studied for polymerization reactions since Hogan and Banks discovered in 1951 that these systems catalyze the polymerization of olefins. 10,187 Hogan and Banks were trying to make gasoline components from propylene with a new catalyst and found, rather accidently, that white powder kept plugging their reactor beds. Since then, the processes based on the Phillips catalyst, named after the company name of the inventors, have been successfully commercialized and most of the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) probably comes from this type of catalysts. Furthermore, the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which is obtained by ethylene copolymerization in the presence of small quantities of α-olefins (1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). Actually a whole battery of chromium-based catalysts are now used in the Phillips polymerization process, and each catalyst produces its own polymer type with typical properties, acquired by the customers. Details about reactor design and characteristics of the produced polymers can be found in reviews of Hogan13 and McDaniel. 6,188 Prior to use in ethylene polymerization, the Cr/SiO2 catalysts need to be activated at high temperatures to remove adsorbed water and to reduce the surface hydroxyl population since both retard the ethylene polymerization reaction. During activation, Cr is anchored on the surface by reaction with the hydroxyl groups of the support and typical surface chromium species are formed. Upon exposure to the reducing ethylene stream, these surface chromium species becomes reduced and formaldehyde is formed as the oxidation product. 189 The induction time observed in ethylene polymerization is caused by this first reaction and the displacement of the oxidation products. However, ethylene polymerization occurs immediately with catalysts prereduced with CO or an alkylaluminum compound. The second reaction is then the alkylation in which the first polymer chain starts growing and very little is known about this step.188 The two subsequent reaction steps, occurring continuously and simultaneously during polyethylene polymerization, are propagation and chain transfer. During propagation, ethylene is inserted into a Cralkyl bond extending the polymer chain with one unit, while by β-H elimination the chain is cleaved and a new one may begin on the same Cr site. The time needed to grow a chain is typically less than a second and the chain length is determined by the rate of propagation relative to elimination, and both are extremely sensitive to the local environment around the active Cr center. Therefore, different Cr sites may make different chain lengths.
Since the discovery of the Phillips polymerization catalysts, a lively debate has been started about the active site for olefin polymerization and every oxidation state between +6 and +2 has been proposed.6 However, the main species after reduction with CO and ethylene is Cr2+, which readily coordinate and polymerize ethylene. The ability of the Cr/SiO2 catalysts to be mainly reduced to Cr2+, may be one of the reasons that this catalyst is so superior to other catalysts such as Cr/Al2O3, which can only be reduced to Cr3+. Hopefully, this issue can be resolved in the future with in situ quantitative spectroscopical investigations.
The efficiency of the supported chromium catalysts decreases with increasing Cr loading. Typical Cr loadings in Phillips catalysts are 1 wt % for slurry type and 0.2 wt % for gas-phase polymerization.187 Lower polymer weights are obtained by increasing the catalyst activation temperature and by using silicas having larger pore diameters. Furthermore, industrial Cr/SiO2 catalysts are sometimes promoted by the addition of surface titania to the catalyst. The addition of the surface titania enhances the polymerization rate and alters the molecular weight distribution of the polyethylene product. 196-199 The above-described characterization studies revealed that the addition of surface titania to pyrogenic Cr/SiO2 changes the predominant surface monochromate species to comparable amounts of surface monochromate and polychromate species by associating the surface Cr species with the surface titania sites. The coordination of the surface Cr species with the surface titania sites on the silica support, via formation of CrOTi bonds,196 may account for the enhanced activity of such catalysts and the presence of two distinct active sites may give rise to a different product distribution observed with Cr/Ti/SiO2 catalysts Finally, zeolites loaded with Cr ions have been found to be also active in ethylene polymerization.114,200-201 Yashima et al. found that Cr3+-exchanged zeolite Y was active in ethylene polymerization only when it was activated in vacuo, and was completely inactive after its oxidation by oxygen or reduction by CO or H2.114 However, there is presently no consensus about the active Cr site. According to Wichterlova and co-workers, a necessary condition for ethylene polymerization is the presence of a vacant coordination sphere in an isolated Cr ion and its localization in an accessible zeolitic site.201
