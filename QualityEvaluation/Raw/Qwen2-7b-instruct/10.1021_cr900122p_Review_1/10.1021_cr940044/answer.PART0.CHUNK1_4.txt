(1) Under hydrated conditions, the chemistry of Cr at the surface is determined by the isoelectric point, the surface area of the support, and the Cr loading. Thus, at low loadings and high surface areas, the monochromate:dichromate ratio increases with increasing isoelectric point of the support. A tendency toward the formation of polychromates is observed for higher loadings and lower surface areas. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface by reactions with the hydroxyl groups and their molecular structure is determined by the composition and type of the support, the Cr loading, and the treatment.

(2) Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ are present, each under different coordination and polymerization degrees, depending on the support type and composition. In particular, reduction to Cr3+ for supported Cr on alumina and to Cr2+ for supported Cr on silica, which parallels the hardness/softness character of these supports.

(3) Supported Cr ions are mobile and possess a high reactivity toward various molecules, like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. In general, the redox behavior is support type- and composition-dependent and supported Cr ions are easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. Thus, the oxide support acts as a ligand that controls the redox properties of the supported Cr ions.

(4) The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), several factors collectively influence the process efficiency. The interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complexity of the reactions involved. The literature discusses the importance of C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction as key steps in the mechanism of ODH. Site isolation, a strategy to enhance selectivity, is also highlighted.

The role of site isolation involves creating distinct active sites on the catalyst surface, which can selectively react with specific alkane molecules. This approach aims to minimize unwanted side reactions and increase the conversion efficiency. The use of supported systems, such as Cr supported on silica or alumina, allows for precise control over the metal loading and support properties, which in turn affects the reaction kinetics and product distribution.

Bulk metal oxides, on the other hand, offer a different set of challenges and opportunities. These materials may exhibit unique reactivity patterns due to their size and surface-to-volume ratio. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains a significant hurdle, often requiring careful tuning of the catalyst preparation conditions and operating parameters.

Overall, the collective influence of these factors on the process efficiency highlights the complexity of ODH and the ongoing efforts to optimize catalyst design and operation. Site isolation strategies, among others, represent promising avenues for enhancing selectivity and conversion rates, thus improving the economic viability and environmental impact of this industrially important reaction.

分析轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，多种因素共同影响其效率。不同催化剂的相互作用，包括体相金属氧化物和负载系统，扮演着关键角色。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战往往源于反应的复杂性。文献讨论了C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H摘除作为ODH机制的关键步骤的重要性。位点隔离策略，旨在增强选择性，也得到了强调。

位点隔离涉及在催化剂表面上创建特定的活性位点，可以选择性地与特定的烷烃分子反应。这一方法旨在最小化副反应并提高转化效率。支持系统，如Cr负载在硅胶或铝胶上，允许对金属负载和支撑材料属性进行精确控制，进而影响反应动力学和产物分布。

另一方面，体相金属氧化物提供了不同的挑战和机遇。这些材料由于其尺寸和表面积比可能表现出独特的反应模式。然而，实现高选择性和转化率仍然是一个重大挑战，通常需要仔细调整催化剂制备条件和操作参数。

总体而言，这些因素对过程效率的影响凸显了ODH的复杂性及其持续优化催化剂设计和操作的努力。位点隔离策略等，代表了增强选择性和转化率的有希望途径，从而改善这一工业重要反应的经济可行性和环境影响。
