[1] "The aim of this publication is to study the catalytic and structural effects of substitutions in the M2 phase for its performance in converting propene to acrylonitrile."
[2] "Tuning of the composition of the M2 phase is of interest not only as M2 together with M1 being components in propane (amm)oxidation catalysts, but also because M2 on its own right being a candidate catalyst for propene ammoxidation."

The study focuses on understanding how substitutions within the M2 phase affect its catalytic properties, specifically in the conversion of propene to acrylonitrile. This research is relevant not only for the components in propane (amm)oxidation catalysts but also as M2 has potential as a standalone catalyst for propene ammoxidation.

这项研究专注于理解在M2相中进行替换如何影响其催化性能，特别是对于丙烯转化为丙烯腈的作用。这项研究不仅与丙烷（氨）氧化催化剂的组成部分有关，而且M2本身作为丙烯氨氧化反应潜在催化剂的可能性也值得关注。
