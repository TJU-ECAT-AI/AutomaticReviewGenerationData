The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates are addressed through the optimization of catalyst properties, such as the structure and composition of the metal oxide phases. In the context of the MoVNbTe-oxide system, substitutions in the M2 phase have been shown to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity for acrylonitrile production from propene. This is attributed to the ability of certain substitution metals, like tungsten (W) and cerium (Ce), to mimic the roles of molybdenum (Mo) and vanadium (V) through site isolation and electronic or redox effects, thereby improving the conversion of propene into acrylonitrile while reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts like acrolein. The optimal relationship between the M1 and M2 phases within the catalyst can lead to yields of acrylonitrile from propane reaching up to 62%. These findings suggest that site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for more controlled and efficient reactions, leading to higher yields of the desired product.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及使用各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，以高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通过优化催化剂性质得到解决，如金属氧化物相的结构和组成。在MoVNbTe-氧化物体系的背景下，M2相中的替换已经证明可以增强催化活性和丙烯腈生产的选择性。这归因于某些替换金属，如钨(W)和铈(Ce)，通过位点隔离和电子或氧化还原效应来模仿钼(Mo)和钒(V)的作用，从而提高丙烯转化为丙烯腈的效率，同时减少形成不需要的副产品如丙烯醛。催化剂中M1和M2相之间的最佳关系可以使丙烯腈从丙烷的产率达到62%。这些发现表明，位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用，因为它允许更可控和高效的反应，从而获得更高的目标产物产率。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are presented, often due to the complexity of the reactions and the need for precise control over the catalyst properties. For instance, the M1 and M2 phases of the MoVNbTe-oxide system demonstrate different capabilities in propene ammoxidation, with M1 activating propane and M2 converting propene into acrylonitrile. The document highlights the importance of substitution in the M2 phase for improving selectivity and activity towards acrylonitrile formation. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, with metals like tungsten (W) and cerium (Ce) capable of mimicking the functions of molybdenum (Mo) and tellurium (Te), respectively, through electronic and redox effects. The inactive V- and Ti-sites serve as structural adjustors, facilitating the complexation of excess Te on the surface. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, requiring careful consideration of catalyst design and composition for optimized ODH reactions.

Catalytic effects in propene ammoxidation achieved through substitutions in the M2 phase of the MoVNbTe-oxide system Johan Holmberga Staffan Hansenb Robert K. Grassellic,d and Arne Anderssona,* aDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Lund University, Chemical Center, PO Box 124SE-221 00, Lund, Sweden

The aim of this publication is to study the catalytic and structural effects of substitutions in the M2 phase for its performance in converting propene to acrylonitrile.

The M2 phase was likewise shown to have the composition Mo4.31V1.36Nb0.33Te1.81O19.81 (Pmm2; a = 12.6294 A ;b = 7.29156 A ; c = 4.02010 A ; Z = 4), with a structure similar to that of KW3O9 [13], and with Te placed in the hexagonal channels.

The results of the activity measurements and the XPS investigation indicate that the site, activating propene and ammonia on the unsubstituted M2 phase is a surface ensemble of Mo and Te. W and Ce were found to be able to mimic the role of Mo and Te, respectively; W mainly via site isolation and electronic effects, Ce via redox effects.

V- and Ti-sites are shown to be inactive, having merely the role of structure adjusting elements, and serving as templates to complex the excess Te on the surface.

Improvement can be made by optimizing the crystallite sizes and habits of the constituent M1 and M2 phases and their mixing ratio. Another option is to make substitutions in either or both phases.

This research focuses on the catalytic and structural impacts of substituting the M2 phase of the MoVNbTe-oxide system to enhance its performance in converting propene to acrylonitrile. The M2 phase has a structure akin to KW3O9, with Te positioned within hexagonal channels. The study reveals that the active site for propene and ammonia activation on the unmodified M2 phase is a composite of Mo and Te surfaces. Substitution with tungsten (W) and cerium (Ce) can emulate the roles of Mo and Te, respectively. These replacements are facilitated by site isolation and electronic effects for W, and redox effects for Ce. Vanadium (V)- and titanium (Ti)-containing sites are inactive, serving primarily as structure-adjusting elements that complex excess Te on the surface. Enhancements in catalyst performance can be achieved by refining the crystallite sizes and orientations of the M1 and M2 phases, along with their proportion in the catalyst mix.
