The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates are addressed through the optimization of catalyst properties, such as the structure and composition of the metal oxide phases. In the context of the MoVNbTe-oxide system, substitutions in the M2 phase have been shown to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity for acrylonitrile production from propene. This is attributed to the ability of certain substitution metals, like tungsten (W) and cerium (Ce), to mimic the roles of molybdenum (Mo) and vanadium (V) through site isolation and electronic or redox effects, thereby improving the conversion of propene into acrylonitrile while reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts like acrolein. The optimal relationship between the M1 and M2 phases within the catalyst can lead to yields of acrylonitrile from propane reaching up to 62%. These findings suggest that site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for more controlled and efficient reactions, leading to higher yields of the desired product.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及使用各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，以高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通过优化催化剂性质得到解决，如金属氧化物相的结构和组成。在MoVNbTe-氧化物体系的背景下，M2相中的替换已经证明可以增强催化活性和丙烯腈生产的选择性。这归因于某些替换金属，如钨(W)和铈(Ce)，通过位点隔离和电子或氧化还原效应来模仿钼(Mo)和钒(V)的作用，从而提高丙烯转化为丙烯腈的效率，同时减少形成不需要的副产品如丙烯醛。催化剂中M1和M2相之间的最佳关系可以使丙烯腈从丙烷的产率达到62%。这些发现表明，位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用，因为它允许更可控和高效的反应，从而获得更高的目标产物产率。
