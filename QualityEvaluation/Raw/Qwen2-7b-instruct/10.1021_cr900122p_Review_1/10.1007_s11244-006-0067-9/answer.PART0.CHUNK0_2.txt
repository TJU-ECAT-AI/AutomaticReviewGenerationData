[1] "The M1 phase has been reported to have the composition Mo7.8V1.2NbTe0.937O28.9 (Pba2; a = 21.134 A ;b = 26.658 A ; c = 4.0146 A ; Z = 4) [12]."
[2] "The M2 phase was likewise shown to have the composition Mo4.31V1.36Nb0.33Te1.81O19.81 (Pmm2; a = 12.6294 A ;b = 7.29156 A ; c = 4.02010 A ; Z = 4) [12], with a structure similar to that of KW3O9 [13], and with Te placed in the hexagonal channels."
[3] "The catalysts have been examined with BET, XRD, XPS and activity measurements in order to determine the success of the substitution."
[4] "With an optimal relationship between M1 and M2 in the catalyst, yields of acrylonitrile from propane up to 62% have been reported [1, 2, 7]."
[5] "The results of the activity measurements and the XPS investigation indicate that the site, activating propene and ammonia on the unsubstituted M2 phase is a surface ensemble of Mo and Te."
[6] "W and Ce were found to be able to mimic the role of Mo and Te, respectively; W mainly via site isolation and electronic effects, Ce via redox effects."
[7] "V- and Ti-sites are shown to be inactive, having merely the role of structure adjusting elements, and serving as templates to complex the excess Te on the surface."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are presented, often due to the complexity of the reactions and the need for precise control over the catalyst properties. For instance, the M1 and M2 phases of the MoVNbTe-oxide system demonstrate different capabilities in propene ammoxidation, with M1 activating propane and M2 converting propene into acrylonitrile. The document highlights the importance of substitution in the M2 phase for improving selectivity and activity towards acrylonitrile formation. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, with metals like tungsten (W) and cerium (Ce) capable of mimicking the functions of molybdenum (Mo) and tellurium (Te), respectively, through electronic and redox effects. The inactive V- and Ti-sites serve as structural adjustors, facilitating the complexation of excess Te on the surface. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, requiring careful consideration of catalyst design and composition for optimized ODH reactions.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），文献讨论了各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统。实现高选择性和转化的挑战被提出，通常由于反应的复杂性和对催化剂性质精确控制的需求。例如，MoVNbTe-氧化物体系的M1和M2相在丙烯氨氧化中显示不同的能力，M1激活丙烷，而M2将丙烯转化为丙烯腈。文献强调了在M2相中进行替换以改善丙烯腈形成的选择性和活性的重要性。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，钨（W）和铈（Ce）等金属能够通过电子效应和还原效应模仿钼（Mo）和碲（Te）的作用。不活跃的V-和Ti位点作为结构调整器，在表面促进多余的Te的复合。这些因素共同影响过程效率，需要仔细考虑催化剂设计和组成以优化ODH反应。
