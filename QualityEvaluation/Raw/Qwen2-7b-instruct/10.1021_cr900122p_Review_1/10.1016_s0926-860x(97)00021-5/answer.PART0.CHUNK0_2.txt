[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts contain a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support (e.g., A1203, TiO2, SIO2, etc.)."
[2] "Comparison of the molecular structure and reactivity information provides new fundamental insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V and bridging V-O-support bonds, (2) the number of surface vanadia sites required, (3) the influence of metal oxide additives, (4) the influence of surface acidic and basic sites, (5) the influence of preparation methods and (6) the influence of the specific oxide support phase."
[3] "The terminal V=O bonds have been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts [4]."
[4] "However, the combination of in situ Raman and hydrocarbon oxidation reactivity studies have recently suggested that the reaction properties are not related to the characteristics of the terminal V=O bonds in supported vanadia catalysts."
[5] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the complexities in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates, which are crucial factors influencing the overall process efficiency. The interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a significant role in determining the effectiveness of the ODH process. Challenges often stem from the difficulty in maintaining high selectivity, particularly when dealing with multiple competing pathways for alkane oxidation.

In terms of reaction mechanisms, the document suggests that the oxidative dehydrogenation involves the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The role of site isolation is critical in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for a more controlled and selective pathway for alkane dehydrogenation, minimizing unwanted side reactions. The properties of the surface vanadia species, such as the terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support bonds, are found to influence the catalytic performance significantly. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a given reaction, along with the specific phase of the oxide support and preparation methods, are also key determinants of catalytic activity and selectivity.

To optimize the ODH process, it is essential to understand how these factors collectively influence the efficiency of the reaction. This includes the precise control of catalyst composition, surface structure, and the operating conditions to ensure high conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity towards the desired products. The insights gained from studying the structure-reactivity relationships of surface vanadia species can contribute to the molecular engineering of catalysts, enabling the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODH reactions.
