The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) demands high selectivity and conversion efficiency. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are employed in this process. Achieving high selectivity is challenging due to the intricate nature of controlling reaction pathways. Catalyst performance is affected by factors such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is essential for enhancing selectivity by restricting reactions to specific sites on the catalyst. Process efficiency hinges on balancing selectivity and conversion rates.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）需要高选择性和转化率。各种催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和负载系统，被用于这个过程。实现高选择性具有挑战性，因为控制反应路径的复杂性。催化剂性能受到如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H移除等因素的影响。位点隔离对于通过限制反应仅在催化剂上的特定位点进行来提高选择性至关重要。过程效率取决于选择性和转化率的平衡。
