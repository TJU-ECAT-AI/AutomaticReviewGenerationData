The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are utilized to facilitate this process. High selectivity often conflicts with the formation of unwanted products. Achieving high conversion while maintaining selectivity remains a significant hurdle. Proposed reaction pathways include C-H bond activation, creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation in supported catalysts helps manage selectivity by limiting reactions to specific sites.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程面临着实现高选择性和转化率的挑战。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，在这个过程中起着关键作用。高选择性往往与形成不希望的产品相冲突。在不牺牲选择性的前提下实现高转化率仍然是一个重大挑战。提出的反应机制包括C-H键活化、形成M-烷基中间体和2H-抽象。在支撑催化剂中的位点隔离有助于通过限制反应到特定位点来管理选择性。
