[1] "The influence of preparation methods upon the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has also been examined [3,5,28,64,65]."
[2] "In the case of silica supported vanadia catalysts, where different pre- paration methods can affect the surface coverage of the surface vanadia species, the same isolated surface vanadia species results from all the different syntheses [21,25,42,44,48]."
[3] "The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts [4]."
[4] "The TOF for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride over V2Os/TiO2 was also found to slightly increase, by a factor of 2-3, with surface vanadia coverage because of the requirement of several surface vanadia sites for this hydrocarbon oxidation reaction (see discussion below) [36]."
[5] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
[6] "The surface vanadia species possesses both Lewis and BrCnsted acid properties and the ratio of BrCnsted acidity to Lewis acidity increases with surface vanadia coverage (see discussion above in Section 6)."
[7] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
[8] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."
[9] "It is especially important to distinguish between the findings of such complicated pigment grade supported vanadia catalysts and well-defined model supported vanadia catalysts in order to minimize the confusion in the literature."

1. Preparation methods have an impact on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species. Different synthesis techniques can affect the surface vanadia species' coverage on silica-supported catalysts, but they all result in the same isolated surface vanadia species.
2. Terminal V=O bonds have been suggested to carry critical oxygen in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts.
3. The TOF for butane to maleic anhydride conversion increases by a factor of 2-3 with increased surface vanadia coverage, indicating the necessity of multiple surface vanadia sites for this reaction.
4. The bridging V-O-support bond seems crucial for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, as altering the oxide support's structure significantly influences the reaction rate.
5. The ratio of BrCnsted to Lewis acidity in the surface vanadia species rises with surface coverage, affecting reaction rates.
6. The number of surface vanadia sites needed for hydrocarbon oxidation varies depending on the reactant molecule.
7. Additives, whether acidic or basic, can influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but their effects are specific to individual reactions.
8. It's essential to differentiate between findings from complex pigment grade supported vanadia catalysts and simpler model catalysts to avoid confusion in the literature.
