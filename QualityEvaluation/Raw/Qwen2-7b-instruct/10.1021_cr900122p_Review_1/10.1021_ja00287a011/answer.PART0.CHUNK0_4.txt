[1] "The activation of methane for partial oxidation over MgO is currently being investigated under more conventional catalytic conditions."
[2] "The reactions were run at 500 O C unless stated otherwise."
[3] "The system used to carry out the matrix isolation experiments has been described in considerable detail elsewhere, and only the most important features and modifications will be given here."
[4] "Over pure MgO, intrinsic cation vacancies react with molecular oxygen to give an 0- center which can abstract a hydrogen atom from methane to produce the methyl radical."
[5] "The [Li+O-] centers are believed to originate from lithium oxide precipitates which at high temperatures give rise to 'microgalaxies' containing large concentrations of substitutional lithium ions."
[6] "Unlike the case with transition-metal oxides, no variation in oxidation state of the metal ion is required."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves considering the interplay between various catalysts, particularly focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms. These mechanisms often involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The role of site isolation plays a crucial part in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific active sites, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process. The proposed reaction mechanisms and the nature of the catalysts together determine the process efficiency, with factors such as the specific surface area, defect structure, and dopants influencing the overall catalytic activity.
