[4] "Over pure MgO, intrinsic cation vacancies react with molecular oxygen to give an 0- center which can abstract a hydrogen atom from methane to produce the methyl radical."
[5] "For the lithium-doped samples, substitutional Li' ions react with molecular oxygen to form a [Li'O-] center which is also capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from methane."
[6] "The fact that sodium was less effective in generating active sites than lithium also suggests the importance of a substitutional defect site."
[7] "Unlike the case with transition-metal oxides, no variation in oxidation state of the metal ion is required."
[8] "The rather large activation energy of 42 kcal mol-I probably involves either the mobility of species across the surface, e.g.,reaction 5 , or the formation of 0; via an endothermic reaction."
[9] "Ethane probably occurs via the coupling of the gas-phase methyl radicals, but the conversion of methane is quite small."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights several key aspects. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are evident, particularly concerning the efficient activation of C-H bonds. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve the creation of M-alkyl intermediates and the abstraction of 2H from alkanes. Site isolation, in terms of the unique properties of specific catalysts like MgO, is pivotal in addressing selectivity issues. The literature underscores the importance of oxygen ions at sites of low coordination in facilitating hydrogen abstraction and radical formation. The activation energy for these reactions, around 42 kcal mol^-1, suggests complex surface processes or endothermic formation steps. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals to form ethane is noted as a significant pathway, yet the conversion of methane remains limited. These factors collectively influence process efficiency, with site-specific catalyst properties being key determinants of selectivity and conversion rates.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，文献强调了几个关键方面。各种催化剂，包括固体金属氧化物和负载型系统，在此过程中起着至关重要的作用。在实现高选择性和转化率方面存在挑战，特别是在有效活化C-H键方面。提出的反应机制涉及M-烷基中间体的产生和烷烃中2H的抽象。通过位点隔离，即特定催化剂如MgO的独特性质，对于解决选择性问题至关重要。文献强调了低配位处氧离子在促进氢原子提取和自由基形成中的重要性。这些反应的激活能约为42 kcal mol^-1，暗示涉及表面过程或放热反应的复杂步骤。气体相甲基自由基耦合形成乙烷被视为一个显著途径，但甲烷的转化率仍然有限。这些因素共同影响了过程效率，而位点特异性的催化剂特性是决定选择性和转化率的关键因素。
