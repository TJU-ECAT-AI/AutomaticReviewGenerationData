<quotes>
[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[2] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study indicates that carbon dioxide has a promoting effect specifically on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. This effect leads to an increased yield of propylene (C3H6) and reduced catalyst deactivation.
