[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoting effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane were observed specifically when using a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. This resulted in an increase in the yield of propylene (C3H6) and a reduction in catalyst deactivation.

二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢过程的促进作用仅在SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂上观察到。这导致丙烯（C3H6）产率的增加和催化剂失活的减少。
