[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

The study investigated the impact of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propene over different chromium oxide catalysts supported on alumina, activated carbon, and silica. Carbon dioxide showed promoting effects exclusively on the silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst. Over this type of catalyst, carbon dioxide increased the yield of propene and helped prevent catalyst deactivation.

研究了二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的影响，使用了不同氧化铬催化剂，分别支持在氧化铝、活性炭和二氧化硅上。仅在二氧化硅支持的氧化铬催化剂中观察到了促进效应。在这类催化剂上，二氧化碳提高了丙烯的产率，并有助于防止催化剂失活。
