"The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."
"Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."
"The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

The study investigated the impact of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane, focusing on Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials such as Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. The results showed that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect specifically on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. This effect led to an increased yield of propylene (C3H6) and reduced catalyst deactivation.

研究了二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢制丙烯的影响，重点是Al2O3、活性碳和SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂。结果表明，二氧化碳仅在SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂上显示出促进作用。这种效应导致丙烯（C3H6）产量增加并减少了催化剂的失活。
