[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."
[2] "The k3/k1 ratio, which causes the yield losses observed as conversion increases, is large (540) on VOx-based catalysts."
[3] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[4] "Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions occur on different active sites, and the relative abundance of these two types of binding sites is influenced by the structure of the MOx species."
[5] "Metal oxides having high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes faces challenges due to the limitation caused by the secondary combustion of primary alkene products, resulting in low yields. 
2. The k3/k1 ratio, which affects the yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts, indicating a significant issue in achieving high selectivity and conversion.
3. The difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion escalates as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases, reflecting the impact of catalyst properties on reaction rates.
4. The distinctiveness in active sites between propane ODH and combustion reactions, influenced by the structure of MOx species, plays a crucial role in affecting their relative abundances.
5. Catalysts with high redox properties exhibit superior catalytic activity, whereas less acidic metal oxides lead to lower ΔE1  ΔE3 values and smaller k3/k1 ratios, ultimately enhancing propene yield.

1. 由于初级烯烃产物的次级燃烧限制，烷烃转化为烯烃的氧化脱氢化（ODH）目前并未得到广泛应用。
2. 在VOx基催化剂上，导致随着转化率增加而观察到的产率损失的k3/k1比率非常大（540），这表明在高选择性和转化率方面存在重大问题。
3. 烷烃脱氢和丙烯燃烧之间的激活能差随着阳离子酸性的增加而增加（V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+），这反映了催化剂性质对反应速率的影响。
4. 烷烃脱氢和燃烧反应发生在不同的活性位点上，这些位点的相对丰度受到MOx物种结构的影响。
5. 具有高还原性的金属氧化物表现出优异的催化活性，而较不酸性的金属氧化物导致较低的ΔE1  ΔE3值和较小的k3/k1比率，最终提高丙烯产率。
