[1] "In spite of its significant economic potential as an alternate route to alkenes 1-5 and in spite of extensive scientific studies, 1-22 the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."
[2] "Propane combustion rates, however, are less affected by VOx surface density, which leads to a decrease in k2/k1 ratios as surface density increases."
[3] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[4] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
[5] "The kinetics and reaction pathways for propane ODH on VOx-based catalysts have been described in detail previously. 31 The ODH rate is proportional to C3H8 partial pressures and independent of O2 partial pressures when H2O partial pressures are low; the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes faces challenges due to the limitation of alkene yields, which are often around 30% for propane and higher alkanes, due to the secondary combustion of primary alkene products. Propane combustion rates are less affected by the surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx), leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as the surface density increases.

2. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases, specifically following the sequence V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+.

3. The reactivity of propene is enhanced in part because the weakest C-H bond in propane (the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic C-H bond in propene.

4. Propane ODH rates on vanadium oxide (VOx)-based catalysts are described in detail previously. The ODH rate is proportional to the partial pressure of propane and independent of the partial pressure of oxygen when water partial pressures are low. The rates acquire a more complex dependence on propane and oxygen pressures when water is present at higher concentrations.

1. 烷烃转化为烯烃的氧化脱氢化（ODH）面临挑战，因为主要烷烃产品的二次燃烧限制了丙烷和更高烷烃的烯烃产率，通常约为30%。丙烷燃烧速率受VOx表面密度的影响较小，导致在表面密度增加时，丙烯燃烧与丙烷脱氢化（k2/k1）比率下降。

2. 丙烷ODH与丙烯燃烧之间观察到的激活能差随阳离子酸性的增加而增大，具体遵循V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+的序列。

3. 丙烯的反应性增强部分原因是丙烷中较弱的C-H键（甲基键）比丙烯中的支链C-H键强得多。

4. 之前详细描述了基于钒氧化物（VOx）的催化剂上的丙烷ODH。丙烷ODH速率与丙烷分压成正比，且当水分压较低时，氧气分压不影响速率。当水存在较高浓度时，丙烷和氧气的压力对速率的影响变得更加复杂。
