Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature discusses the complexities in achieving high selectivity and conversion, particularly in relation to various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in this process involve the efficient activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of isolating active sites responsible for the direct combustion of alkanes.

The reaction mechanisms proposed in the study involve C-H bond activation steps using lattice oxygen atoms, which are common across VOx and MoOx catalysts. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase sequentially, VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while reaction rates decrease in the same order. This suggests that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane also influence reaction rates, depending on the Lewis acidity of the cations involved in π-bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces.

High redox properties of metal oxides correlate with high catalytic activity, whereas less acidic metal oxides lead to a reduction in ΔE1  ΔE3 value and a smaller k3/k1 ratio, resulting in higher propene yields. The study demonstrates that the interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in enhancing selectivity and conversion rates.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程时，文献讨论了实现高选择性和转化率的挑战，特别是针对不同类型的催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和支撑系统。该过程的复杂性涉及有效激活C-H键、形成M-烷基中间体以及2H的抽象。在解决选择性问题中，隔离活性位点的重要性被强调，特别关注于隔离直接烷烃燃烧的活性位点。

提出的反应机制涉及使用晶格氧原子进行C-H键活化步骤，在VOx和MoOx催化剂上是共通的。烷烃脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能按照顺序增加，VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2，而反应速率则按相反的顺序减少。这表明丙烯和丙烷的相对吸附焓也影响着反应速率，取决于参与烯烃上π键的离子在氧化物表面的Lewis酸度。

高氧化还原性质的金属氧化物与高催化活性相关联，而较不酸性的金属氧化物导致ΔE1  ΔE3值减小和较小的k3/k1比率，从而获得更高的丙烯产率。研究结果表明，这些因素之间的相互作用共同影响过程效率，其中位点隔离在提高选择性和转化率方面发挥着关键作用。
