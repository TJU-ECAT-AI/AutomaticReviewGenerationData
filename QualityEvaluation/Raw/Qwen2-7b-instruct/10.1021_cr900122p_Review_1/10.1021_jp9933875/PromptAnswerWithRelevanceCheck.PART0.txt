[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."
[2] "The k3/k1 ratio, which causes the yield losses observed as conversion increases, is large (540) on VOx-based catalysts."
[3] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[4] "Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions occur on different active sites, and the relative abundance of these two types of binding sites is influenced by the structure of the MOx species."
[5] "Metal oxides having high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield."

[1] "In spite of its significant economic potential as an alternate route to alkenes 1-5 and in spite of extensive scientific studies, 1-22 the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."
[2] "Propane combustion rates, however, are less affected by VOx surface density, which leads to a decrease in k2/k1 ratios as surface density increases."
[3] "The k3/k1 (propene secondary combustion/propane primary dehydrogenation) ratio, which causes the yield losses observed as conversion increases, is large (540) on VOx-based catalysts."
[4] "This difference in activation energy (4861 kJ/mol) between propane ODH and propene combustion is larger than between bond dissociation enthalpies for the weakest CH bond in propane and propene (40 kJ/mol) and it increases in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2."
[5] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[6] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
[7] "The strength of the conjugate base (lattice oxygen atoms) decreases with increasing cation acid strength and the basicity of the lattice oxygen atoms therefore increases in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2."
[8] "Clearly, small k3/k1 ratios require small differences in adsorption enthalpies between propane and propene. VOx, MoOx, and WOx contain electron-deficient cations that act as Lewis acid centers and WOx/ZrO2 has been widely studied as an acid catalyst."
[9] "Measured k2/k1 ratios depend only weakly on temperature on all three catalysts (Figure 7), suggesting that propane ODH and propane combustion activation energies are very similar."
[10] "In ODH reactions, the redox properties of oxide catalysts play an important role in determining reaction rates,37 and the relative CH bond energies in alkanes and alkenes strongly influence alkene yields.23 The acidbase properties of oxide catalysts, however, can also influence both reaction rates and alkene yields."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it is clear that several factors collectively influence the process efficiency and selectivity. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the secondary combustion of primary alkene products, limiting alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes. The role of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial part in this process.

The reaction mechanisms proposed include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These steps are fundamental to understanding how the catalysts facilitate the dehydrogenation of alkanes into alkenes. However, the efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by site isolation, which addresses selectivity issues by ensuring that the desired alkene products are not converted into undesired COx products.

Lewis acidity and basicity of the cations involved in π-bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces also play a pivotal role in influencing the adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane. This, in turn, affects the relative reaction rates of these molecules, with the adsorption enthalpy differences depending on the Lewis acidity of the cations. High redox properties of metal oxides contribute to their high catalytic activity, while less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller activation energy differences and thus higher propene yields.

The key findings indicate that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane, influenced by the Lewis acidity of the cations, affect the relative reaction rates. This is particularly evident in the comparison of activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion across different catalysts. The activation energy for propane dehydrogenation is higher than for propene combustion, resulting in a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio as temperature increases.

The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is also highlighted. This ensures that the desired alkene products are not converted into COx products, enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODH process. In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is influenced by a complex interplay between various factors, including catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and selectivity optimization strategies.

The importance of considering the acid-base properties of the catalysts cannot be overstressed. These properties impact not only reaction rates but also alkene yields, making them a critical consideration in the design and selection of catalysts for the ODH process. By understanding these relationships, researchers and engineers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for alkyne production from alkanes.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，可以看出多个因素共同影响着这一过程的效率和选择性。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于主要烯烃产物的二次燃烧，导致丙烷和更高碳数烷烃的烯烃产率仅约为30%。

在这一过程中起关键作用的催化剂，包括纯金属氧化物和支撑系统，是理解ODH过程的关键。提出的反应机制包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体以及2H-摘除。这些步骤是理解催化剂如何促进烷烃转化为烯烃的基础。然而，过程效率受到位点隔离的影响，这是解决选择性问题的重要策略，确保所需的烯烃产品不会转化为不希望的COx产物。

金属氧化物中参与烯烃上π键的离子的Lewis酸碱性也对丙烷和丙烯的吸附焓产生影响。这进而影响这两种分子的相对反应速率，吸附焓差异取决于金属离子的Lewis酸碱性。具有较高还原性的金属氧化物显示出较高的催化活性，而较不酸性的金属氧化物导致较小的激活能量差异，从而获得更高的丙烯产率。

研究发现，丙烷脱氢的激活能高于丙烯燃烧，导致温度升高时k3/k1比率下降。这种差异（4861 kJ/mol）大于丙烷和丙烯中最弱C-H键的断裂能差，并且随着序列VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2的增加而增大。这表明相对丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧速率不仅取决于C-H键能差异，还取决于丙烯和丙烷的吸附焓，反映了参与烯烃上π键的离子的Lewis酸碱性。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面的重要性也得到了强调。这确保了所需烯烃产品的形成，而不是转化为COx产物，从而提高了ODH过程的整体效率。简而言之，烷烃的氧化脱氢受多种因素的复杂相互作用影响，包括催化剂性质、反应机制以及选择性优化策略。

考虑催化剂的酸碱性质的重要性不容忽视。这些性质不仅影响反应速率，而且影响烯烃产率，使其成为设计和选择ODH过程催化剂时需要考虑的关键因素。通过了解这些关系，研究人员和工程师可以开发出更高效和选择性更强的催化剂，用于从烷烃生产炔烃。

综上所述，烷烃的氧化脱氢过程受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂特性、反应机制以及选择性优化策略的重要性，理解这些关系对于开发更高效的ODH过程至关重要。

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is hindered by the secondary combustion of primary alkene products, which limits alkene yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes. This challenge has been extensively studied but not resolved due to the economic potential of ODH as an alternative route to alkenes.

2. The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs through a series of parallel and sequential steps, involving both direct and indirect oxidation pathways.

3. Selective poisoning of catalyst sites responsible for direct alkane combustion using silica (SiOx) has been documented.

4. The rate of propane combustion is less sensitive to the surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) than the rate of propane dehydrogenation. This results in a decrease in the k2/k1 ratio as the surface density of VOx increases.

5. Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions exhibit similar activation energies. This indicates that the processes determining the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species—whether they are desorbed as alkenes or undergo further oxidation—occur after the critical C-H bond activation steps in propane.

6. Metal oxides with high redox properties demonstrate high catalytic activity, whereas less acidic metal oxides result in a lower difference between the activation energies of propane ODH and propene combustion (ΔE1  ΔE3), leading to a higher yield of propene.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature discusses the complexities in achieving high selectivity and conversion, particularly in relation to various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in this process involve the efficient activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of isolating active sites responsible for the direct combustion of alkanes.

The reaction mechanisms proposed in the study involve C-H bond activation steps using lattice oxygen atoms, which are common across VOx and MoOx catalysts. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase sequentially, VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while reaction rates decrease in the same order. This suggests that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane also influence reaction rates, depending on the Lewis acidity of the cations involved in π-bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces.

High redox properties of metal oxides correlate with high catalytic activity, whereas less acidic metal oxides lead to a reduction in ΔE1  ΔE3 value and a smaller k3/k1 ratio, resulting in higher propene yields. The study demonstrates that the interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in enhancing selectivity and conversion rates.

高氧化还原性质的金属氧化物与高催化活性相关联，而较不酸性的金属氧化物导致ΔE1  ΔE3值减小和较小的k3/k1比率，从而获得更高的丙烯产率。研究结果表明，这些因素之间的相互作用共同影响过程效率，其中位点隔离在提高选择性和转化率方面发挥着关键作用。
