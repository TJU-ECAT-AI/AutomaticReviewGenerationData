[1] "In spite of its significant economic potential as an alternate route to alkenes 1-5 and in spite of extensive scientific studies, 1-22 the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."
[2] "The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1)."
[3] "Selective poisoning of sites responsible for direct combustion of alkanes using SiOx has been reported."
[4] "Propane combustion rates, however, are less affected by VOx surface density, which leads to a decrease in k2/k1 ratios as surface density increases."
[5] "Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions show similar activation energies, suggesting that the steps involved in determining the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species (desorption vs subsequent oxidation) occur after the kinetically relevant CH activation steps in propane."
[6] "Metal oxides having high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is hindered by the secondary combustion of primary alkene products, which limits alkene yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes. This challenge has been extensively studied but not resolved due to the economic potential of ODH as an alternative route to alkenes.

2. The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs through a series of parallel and sequential steps, involving both direct and indirect oxidation pathways.

3. Selective poisoning of catalyst sites responsible for direct alkane combustion using silica (SiOx) has been documented.

4. The rate of propane combustion is less sensitive to the surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) than the rate of propane dehydrogenation. This results in a decrease in the k2/k1 ratio as the surface density of VOx increases.

5. Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions exhibit similar activation energies. This indicates that the processes determining the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species—whether they are desorbed as alkenes or undergo further oxidation—occur after the critical C-H bond activation steps in propane.

6. Metal oxides with high redox properties demonstrate high catalytic activity, whereas less acidic metal oxides result in a lower difference between the activation energies of propane ODH and propene combustion (ΔE1  ΔE3), leading to a higher yield of propene.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢为烯烃的经济潜力巨大，但由于主要烷基产物的次级燃烧限制了烯烃的产率，目前并未广泛应用。尽管进行了大量科学研究，但这一问题尚未得到解决。

2. 轻烷烃氧化为烯烃的过程通过并行和顺序氧化步骤发生，涉及直接和间接氧化途径。

3. 使用二氧化硅（SiOx）对负责直接烷烃燃烧的催化剂位点进行选择性中毒已被报道。

4. 硫酸盐表面密度对范德华氧化物（VOx）的影响下，丙烷燃烧速率相对较少受到丙烷脱氢化的影响。这导致随着VOx表面密度的增加，k2/k1比率下降。

5. 丙烷脱氢化和丙烷燃烧反应具有相似的活化能。这表明决定吸附醇基物种命运的步骤——它们是否作为烯烃脱附或进一步氧化——发生在丙烷中的关键C-H键活化步骤之后。

6. 具有高还原性的金属氧化物显示出较高的催化活性，而较不酸性的金属氧化物导致丙烷脱氢化与丙烯燃烧（ΔE1  ΔE3）之间的差异较小，从而产生更高的丙烯产率。
