The study investigates the simultaneous propane dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation over a CrOX/SiO2 catalyst. The CrOX/SiO2 catalyst exhibits activity in both reactions, indicating its potential in enhancing propane conversion through coupling with the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The use of CO2 increases the conversion of propane and yields propene compared to helium, suggesting a synergistic effect between the RWGS and dehydrogenation reactions. The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is proposed to involve either direct hydrogen removal or acting as a mild oxidant, although determining the predominant pathway remains challenging.

研究考察了CrOX/SiO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢和二氧化碳还原氢化同时进行的情况。CrOX/SiO2催化剂在两个反应中均表现出活性，表明其通过将逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应与脱氢反应耦合来提高丙烷转化率的潜力。二氧化碳的使用增加了丙烷的转化率并产生了丙烯，这表明RWGS反应和脱氢反应之间存在协同作用。二氧化碳在烃类脱氢中的作用被提议涉及直接氢的去除或作为温和氧化剂的作用，但确定主导途径仍然具有挑战性。
