The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process involves the use of various catalysts, including both bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to convert alkanes into alkenes. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates often stem from the need for precise control over the reaction pathways, particularly in the activation of C-H bonds and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates. The process efficiency is influenced by factors such as catalyst activity, stability, and the ability to isolate reaction sites to prevent unwanted side reactions. In the context of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, the synergy between the RWGS and dehydrogenation reactions plays a crucial role in enhancing propane conversion and propene yield. This synergy is thought to facilitate the oxidative pathway, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates compared to uncatalyzed reactions or reactions using only one of the processes.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，使用各种催化剂，包括纯金属氧化物和负载型系统，将烷烃转化为烯烃。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通常源于对反应途径的精确控制，特别是在C-H键活化和M-烷基中间体形成方面的需要。过程效率受催化剂活性、稳定性和反应位点隔离能力的影响，以防止不希望的副反应。对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂而言，RWGS和脱氢反应之间的协同作用在提高丙烷转化率和丙烯产率方面起着关键作用。这种协同作用被认为促进了氧化途径，导致与仅使用单个过程或未催化反应相比，选择性和转化率得到改善。
