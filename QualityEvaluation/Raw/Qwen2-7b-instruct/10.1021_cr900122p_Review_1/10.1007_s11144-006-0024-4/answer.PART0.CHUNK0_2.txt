[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]."
[2] "One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."
[3] "The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is removal of hydrogen and suppression of coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
[4] "However, the pathway of hydrogen removal is still not clear. It is proposed that carbon dioxide can react directly with hydrogen to make the water gas (CO + H2O) or can act as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "For example, at 873 K and at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92 %, while in the presence of an inert gas, only 75 % conversion can be achieved under the same conditions [2]."
[6] "It was found that the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is active both in the dehydrogenation of propane and in the RWGS reactions."
[7] "The molar ratio of CO/H2 in the process with CO2 was close to unity."
[8] "With increase of the reaction temperature, propane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide conversions increased."
[9] "However, it has to be pointed out that the non-catalyzed reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen proceeds easier than the reaction of propane with carbon dioxide, and above 773 K there are some contributions of a homogeneous reaction to both the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen conversions."
[10] "The results suggest that the promoting effect of CO2 on the propane conversion and the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is caused by synergistic effect between the RWGS and the dehydrogenation reactions."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through the interplay of reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by these factors, particularly the ability of CO2 to remove hydrogen and suppress coke deposition on the catalyst surface. The role of CO2 as either a direct reagent in forming water gas or acting as a mild oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation is discussed. The document also notes that the presence of CO2 can significantly enhance the propane conversion and propene yield, suggesting a synergistic effect between the RWGS and dehydrogenation reactions. The behavior of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst in the RWGS reaction coupled with dehydrogenation differs from that in the single RWGS reaction, indicating that CO2 might also act as an oxidant in an alternative mechanism involving the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane molecule.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的分析中，文献强调了各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，在丙烷与CO2的脱氢中的应用。在实现高选择性和转化率方面，通过反应机制的相互作用，如C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体和2H摘取，来解决挑战。过程效率受这些因素的影响，特别是CO2在去除氢气和抑制催化剂表面沉积焦炭方面的角色。讨论了CO2作为直接形成水煤气或在氧化脱氢中作为温和氧化剂的作用。文献还指出，CO2的存在可以显著提高丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，表明了重整水煤气反应和脱氢反应之间的协同效应。CrOx/SiO2催化剂在重整反应与脱氢耦合中的行为与单独的重整反应不同，表明CO2可能在另一种机制中也充当氧化剂，该机制涉及从烷烃分子摘取氢原子。
