[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]."
[2] "One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the propane conversion and the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is caused by synergistic effect between the RWGS and the dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "However, the behavior of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst in the case of the RWGS reaction coupled with dehydrogenation reaction can be different than in the case of single RWGS reaction. Therefore on the basis of the presented results we cannot exclude the other explanation where CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative pathway (3, 4)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to efficiently convert alkanes into olefins. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the complex nature of the reactions, particularly the activation of C-H bonds and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates. The 2H-abstraction mechanism plays a critical role in the ODH process. Site isolation techniques can help address selectivity issues by controlling the reaction environment, leading to higher efficiency in the production of desired olefinic products.

Answer: The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes utilizes a variety of catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to facilitate the conversion of alkanes into olefins. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complexity of C-H bond activation and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates. The 2H-abstraction mechanism is essential in this process. Implementing site isolation strategies can improve selectivity by managing the reaction environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of olefin production.
