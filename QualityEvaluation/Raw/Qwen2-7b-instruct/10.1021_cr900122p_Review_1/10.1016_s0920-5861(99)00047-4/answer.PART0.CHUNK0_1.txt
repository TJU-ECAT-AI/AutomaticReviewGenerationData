[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [1]."
[2] "It is also clear that degradation reactions result in more hydrogen being produced than alkene, and that a proper choice of feed rate and temperature are needed to achieve an optimum industrial dehydrogenation process that has the required selectivity."
[3] "Summarizing, different surface species are observed on the surface of freshly prepared catalysts, their relative concentration mainly depending on the overall Cr loading, the alumina surface area, and the calcination treatment."
[4] "Thus, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species under reaction conditions."
[5] "The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physicochemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a significant industrial process that converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into valuable alkenes. Proper selection of catalysts, especially those based on chromium oxides supported on alumina, plays a crucial role in achieving high conversion and selectivity.

2. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH include the production of unwanted byproducts like hydrogen, which is favored at high temperatures. Balancing feed rate and temperature ensures efficient and selective conversion to alkenes.

3. Freshly prepared chromium-alumina catalysts exhibit a variety of surface species, with their relative abundance influenced by the chromium loading, alumina surface area, and calcination conditions. These surface compositions evolve upon activation and during the dehydrogenation process.

4. Under reaction conditions, chromium oxide catalysts on alumina support predominantly contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism.

5. The repeated cycling of chromium-alumina catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions causes structural changes that lead to catalyst deactivation. This affects the catalyst's performance and efficiency in the dehydrogenation process.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）在工业中具有重大影响，因为它提供了一条从低成本饱和烃原料制备烯烃的途径。基于铝酸盐支持的铬氧化物催化剂的选择对于实现高转化率和选择性至关重要。

2. 在ODH过程中，实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括产生过多的副产品氢气，这在高温下更为有利。通过合理选择进料速率和温度可以确保高效的高选择性转化。

3. 新鲜制备的铬-铝催化剂表面展现出多种表面物种，它们的相对丰度主要受铬负载、铝酸盐表面积以及煅烧条件的影响。这些表面组成在激活和脱氢过程中会发生变化。

4. 在反应条件下，铬氧化物催化剂上的铝支持主要包含可协调的未配位Cr3物种，这是脱氢反应机制的关键部分。

5. 铬-铝催化剂在氧化和还原条件下的反复循环导致其结构发生变化，最终导致催化剂失活。这种变化影响了催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能和效率。
