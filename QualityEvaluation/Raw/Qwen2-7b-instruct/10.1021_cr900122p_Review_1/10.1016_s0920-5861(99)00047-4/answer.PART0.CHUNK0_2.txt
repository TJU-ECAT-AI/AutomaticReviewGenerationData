[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [1]."
[2] "It will be shown that detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained by using advanced spectroscopic tools."
[3] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process,and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes [3]."
[4] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
[5] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
[6] "As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions."
[7] "Since the discovery of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have done extensive research to develop a commercial dehydrogenation process."
[8] "In all these industrial processes, the heat obtained from the burning of coke is used in the dehydrogenation step."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between catalysts plays a crucial role in determining process efficiency. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are employed to facilitate the activation of C-H bonds, generation of M-alkyl intermediates, and abstraction of 2H. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the inherent unselectivity of dehydrogenation reactions, where all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting. High temperatures, necessary for the process, can favor thermal cracking reactions, leading to the formation of lighter alkanes and coke. Suitable catalysts must possess not only high activity and selectivity but also the capability to suppress thermal cracking reactions. The development of Cr-based catalysts has significantly impacted the ODH process, enabling industries to produce alkenes from low-cost feedstocks efficiently. The heat generated from the burning of coke is utilized in the dehydrogenation step, contributing to the overall process efficiency. Site isolation techniques have been implemented to address selectivity issues, enhancing the effectiveness of the catalysts in controlling the reaction pathway and improving the yield of desired alkenes.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），催化剂之间的相互作用对过程效率至关重要。包括块金属氧化物和支持系统在内的各种催化剂被用来促进C-H键的活化、M-烷基中间体的产生以及2H的抽象。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战往往源于脱氢反应的固有非选择性，所有等效的CH键在烷烃分子中具有相等的键能，因此有相等的机会反应。所需的高温有利于轻烷烃和焦炭的热裂解反应。合适的催化剂不仅需要具有良好的活性和选择性，还需要抑制热裂解反应。自Frey和Huppke发现基于Cr的脱氢催化剂以来[[4,5]],多家工业公司进行了大量研究，以开发商业化的脱氢过程。在所有这些工业过程中，从焦炭燃烧产生的热量用于脱氢步骤。通过实施位点隔离技术来解决选择性问题，增强催化剂的有效性，控制反应途径并提高所需烯烃的产率。
