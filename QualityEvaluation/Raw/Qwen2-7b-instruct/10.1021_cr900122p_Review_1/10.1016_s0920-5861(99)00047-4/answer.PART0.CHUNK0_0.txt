Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, requiring relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes.
Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective.
Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke.
As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.
Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice.
The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mciver, and by Kearby.
Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts.
All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selecitivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism.
In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the inherent unselectivity of dehydrogenation reactions due to the equal bonding energy of all CH bonds in an alkane molecule. High temperatures, necessary for dehydrogenation, also promote thermal cracking and coke formation. Catalysts must balance high activity and selectivity with suppression of unwanted reactions. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, are widely used for their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation. Recent studies focus on identifying active sites, understanding how preparation and treatment conditions affect chromium oxide speciation and catalytic activity, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.

氧化脱氢反应（ODH）涉及到各种催化剂，包括金属氧化物和负载系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括由于烷烃分子中所有CH键具有相等的结合能而导致的脱氢反应的固有非选择性。高温对于脱氢是必要的，但也促进了较轻烷烃和焦炭的热裂解。催化剂需要在保持高活性和选择性的同时抑制不希望的反应。支持型铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是Cr2O3/Al2O3，因其在烷烃脱氢方面的优秀性能而被广泛使用。近期研究集中在识别活性位点、理解制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种分布和催化活性的影响，以及阐明脱氢机制。
