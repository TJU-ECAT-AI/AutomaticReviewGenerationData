Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, requiring relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes.
Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective.
Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke.
As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.
Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice.
The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mciver, and by Kearby.
Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts.
All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selecitivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism.
In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the inherent unselectivity of dehydrogenation reactions due to the equal bonding energy of all CH bonds in an alkane molecule. High temperatures, necessary for dehydrogenation, also promote thermal cracking and coke formation. Catalysts must balance high activity and selectivity with suppression of unwanted reactions. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, are widely used for their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation. Recent studies focus on identifying active sites, understanding how preparation and treatment conditions affect chromium oxide speciation and catalytic activity, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism.

224 Dehydrogenation reactions are rather unselective, because all equivalent CH bonds have an equal bonding energy, and therefore an equal chance of reacting.
225 At low Cr oxide loadings, typically lower than 1 wt%, only Cr6 and Cr5 are detected. However, XPS only detects Cr6, whereas DRS and RS are able to discriminate between chromate and polychromate (dichromate, trichromate, etc.). 
226 In situ DRS spectroscopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3. 
227 The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physicochemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation.

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

ODH involves the conversion of saturated hydrocarbons into unsaturated ones through oxidative processes. Catalysts play a crucial role in facilitating these reactions efficiently. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr/Al2O3, are of high interest due to their superior properties in alkane dehydrogenation. The dehydrogenation process is endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures for significant yield of alkenes. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the unselective nature of the reaction, where all equivalent CH bonds have an equal chance of reacting, leading to potential thermal cracking reactions and the formation of unwanted products.

The proposed reaction mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a key role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific sites on the catalyst, thus enhancing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. The structure of the catalyst, including the surface composition and the distribution of active sites, significantly influences the selectivity and conversion rates. For instance, the presence of Cr6 species, which are more reactive, can facilitate the dehydrogenation process. However, under reaction conditions, these species are reduced to Cr3, forming coordinatively unsaturated sites that are conducive to the formation of alkenes.

The collective factors influencing the process efficiency include the catalyst's ability to promote the desired reaction pathways while suppressing unwanted side reactions. The interaction between the catalyst's surface chemistry and the alkane substrate determines the reaction outcome. Advanced spectroscopic tools, such as in situ Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, provide insights into the dynamic changes occurring on the catalyst surface during the reaction, enabling a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance.

In summary, the efficient oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes requires a careful balance between high activity and selectivity, influenced by the catalyst's structure, surface chemistry, and the reaction conditions. Site isolation through the design of catalysts ensures optimal conversion while minimizing the formation of byproducts, contributing to the overall process efficiency.

ODH涉及通过氧化过程将饱和烃转化为不饱和烃。催化剂在高效促进这些反应方面起着关键作用。特别是支持的铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是Cr/Al2O3，在烷烃脱氢中表现出优越的性质。脱氢过程是吸热的，需要高温和低压以获得显著的烯烃产率。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括反应的非选择性，所有等效CH键具有相等的结合能，导致可能的热裂解反应和不希望生成的产品。

提出的反应机制包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体形成和2H-摘除。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥关键作用，通过限制反应仅在催化剂特定位点上发生，从而提高脱氢过程的效率。催化剂的结构，包括表面组成和活性位点的分布，对选择性和转化率产生重大影响。例如，Cr6物种的存在，由于其更活跃，可以促进脱氢过程。然而，在反应条件下，这些物种被还原为Cr3，形成配位不饱和位点，有利于烯烃的形成。

影响过程效率的集体因素包括催化剂促进所需反应路径的能力，同时抑制不必要的副反应。催化剂表面化学与烷烃基质之间的相互作用决定了反应结果。先进的光谱工具，如原位拉曼光谱和漫反射光谱，提供了关于催化剂表面在反应过程中动态变化的见解，有助于更好地理解反应机制和催化剂性能。

综上所述，高效的烷烃氧化脱氢需要在高活性和选择性之间取得平衡，受催化剂结构、表面化学和反应条件的影响。通过设计催化剂确保最优转化，同时减少副产品的形成，从而贡献于整体过程效率。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion involve intricate interactions with the catalysts' surface chemistry and reaction conditions. For instance, the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species under reaction conditions suggests that these sites might facilitate efficient C-H bond activation and M-alkyl intermediates formation. The role of 2H-abstraction in this process further highlights the importance of site-specific reactions.

Site isolation becomes paramount in addressing selectivity issues, as it helps in controlling the reaction pathways and reducing unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking. The decreasing specific surface area with increasing operational parameters, such as time-on-stream, reaction temperature, and catalytic cycles, indicates the progressive deactivation of the catalysts. This phenomenon is linked to the incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species, suggesting that maintaining optimal reaction conditions and possibly employing strategies to regenerate the catalysts could enhance process efficiency.

In summary, the interplay between catalyst type, surface chemistry, reaction conditions, and site-specific reactivity collectively influences the efficiency of ODH processes. Site isolation strategies offer a promising avenue to mitigate selectivity issues and optimize the conversion and yield of desired alkenes.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，我们注意到各种催化剂，包括体金属氧化物和支持系统，在此过程中发挥着关键作用。实现高选择性和转化的挑战涉及到催化剂表面化学和反应条件的复杂交互作用。例如，反应条件下存在协调不饱和的Cr3物种表明，这些位点可能促进有效的C-H键活化和M-烷基中间体形成。在这一过程中进行2H-消除进一步强调了特定位点反应的重要性。

位点隔离成为解决选择性问题的关键，因为它有助于控制反应途径并减少非期望的副反应，如热裂解。随着操作参数（如运行时间、反应温度和催化周期）的增加，催化剂的特定表面积逐渐降低，这表明催化剂的逐渐失活。这一现象与还原的Cr3物种的不完全氧化有关，暗示通过保持最优反应条件或可能采用再生催化剂策略可以提高过程效率。

总之，催化剂类型、表面化学、反应条件以及特定反应活性之间的相互作用共同影响ODH过程的效率。位点隔离策略为缓解选择性问题和优化所需烯烃的转化和产率提供了一条有希望的途径。
