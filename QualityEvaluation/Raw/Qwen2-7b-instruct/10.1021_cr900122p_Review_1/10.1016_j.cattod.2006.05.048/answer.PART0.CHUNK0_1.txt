[1] "Developing efficient strategies for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes to value-added chemicals or liquid fuels has far-reaching significance."
[2] "Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates was often carried out over supported transition metal oxides."
[3] "However, a high temperature is generally required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature, the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into unwanted carbon oxides."
[4] "A fairly good compliance between H abstraction mechanism and experimental evidences supports that H abstraction is the working mechanism for the activation of alkanes on most high valence transition metal oxides."

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
