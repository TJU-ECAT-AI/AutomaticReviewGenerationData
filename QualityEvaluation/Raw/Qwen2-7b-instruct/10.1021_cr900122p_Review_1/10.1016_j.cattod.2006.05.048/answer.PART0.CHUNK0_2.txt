[1] "Developing efficient strategies for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes to value-added chemicals or liquid fuels has far-reaching significance."
[2] "However, a high temperature is generally required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature, the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into unwanted carbon oxides."
[3] "In the previous work, we have investigated methane [31] and propane [32] activation on molybdenum oxide model catalyst."
[4] "We find that H abstraction pathway is feasible on most oxides."
[5] "Our calculations suggest that when the M O bond possesses a high polarity such as those in tungsten oxides, (2 + 2) becomes an alternative pathway."
[6] "Trends and intrinsic factors that influence the activation modes are discussed."
[7] "Moreover, McCormick et al. [21] reported a promoted effect of Cr addition, which increases the HCHO selectivity."
[8] "We choose M3O9 (M = Cr, Mo and W) and V3O6Cl3 clusters as model catalysts (Fig. 1)."
[9] "We refer to T1 and T2 as the (2 + 2) additions (Fig. 2), which lead to the carbide and the hydride formation, respectively."
[10] "We find that T1 is significantly favored over T2 by about 30 kcal/mol."
[11] "Although both T1 and T2 belong to the (2 + 2) addition, we find that T1 is significantly favored over T2 by about 30 kcal/mol."
[12] "Thus, the reactivity follows the trend W > Mo > V > Cr, in parallel with the polarity of an MO bond."
[13] "For T4, the calculated barriers are 63.6 kcal/mol (V), 39.7 kcal/mol (Cr), 63.2 kcal/mol (Mo) and 80.2 kcal/mol (W)."
[14] "For T3, the calculated barriers are 42.8 kcal/mol (Cr), 68.6 kcal/mol (Mo) and 83.8 kcal/mol (W), suggesting the same trend as Cr > Mo > W."
[15] "Among the eight pathways considered here, the most favorable pathway is anti-H abstraction (T6) by terminal oxygen with the exception of W3O9, where (2 + 2) (T1) appears to be the best pathway."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion due to the high reactivity of C-H bonds in alkanes. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are crucial in this process. The efficiency of the ODH process depends on the interplay between the catalyst's ability to activate the C-H bond, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the subsequent 2H-abstraction reactions. High selectivity and conversion rates are influenced by the catalyst's selectivity towards the desired product, which is often achieved by controlling the reaction pathway and avoiding unwanted side reactions. Site isolation plays a key role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction environment around the active sites, thereby reducing cross-reactions and enhancing the formation of the targeted products.
