The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the need for high temperatures, which can lead to the rapid oxidation of desired oxygenates into unwanted carbon oxides. The interplay between the MO bond polarity and the M-O p bond strength plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathways. When the MO bond polarity is high, such as in tungsten oxides, a (2 + 2) pathway becomes an alternative mechanism. The H abstraction pathway is feasible on most oxides, and it is supported by experimental evidence. This pathway is particularly dominant on high valence transition metal oxides. The balance between MO bond polarity and M-O p bond strength helps address selectivity issues, making vanadium and molybdenum oxides the most active and selective catalysts observed experimentally.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统。由于需要高温以激活烷烃，从而导致所需氧代物快速氧化为不需要的碳氧化物，因此实现高选择性和转化率的挑战很大。MO键极性和M-O p键强度之间的相互作用在确定反应途径中起着关键作用。当MO键极性较高时，如在钨氧化物中，（2 + 2）途径成为替代途径。在大多数高价过渡金属氧化物上，H抽象机制是可行的，并且得到了实验证据的支持。这一途径在高电位过渡金属氧化物上特别占主导地位。平衡MO键极性和M-O p键强度有助于解决选择性问题，使钒和钼氧化物成为观察到的最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂。
