[1] "Especially, the direct conversion of methane to oxygenates such as CH3OH and HCHO is viewed as one of the most challenging goals in catalysis [19]."
[2] "However, a high temperature is generally required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature, the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into unwanted carbon oxides."
[3] "A fairly good compliance between H abstraction mechanism and experimental evidences supports that H abstraction is the working mechanism for the activation of alkanes on most high valence transition metal oxides."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates, particularly due to the high temperatures required for activation that can lead to rapid oxidation of desired oxygenates into unwanted carbon oxides. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in addressing these issues. The interplay between catalyst properties, such as the polarity of metal-oxygen bonds and the strength of metal-oxygen p bonds, influences the efficiency of the process. High-valence transition metal oxides like V and Mo are noted for their high activity and selectivity, possibly due to the balance between these factors. Site isolation techniques might help address selectivity issues by confining reactive intermediates, thus preventing unwanted reactions.

In terms of the reaction mechanisms, C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction are key steps. The H abstraction mechanism, supported by experimental evidence, is proposed as a feasible pathway for alkane activation on high-valence transition metal oxides. This mechanism's feasibility across various catalysts indicates its potential for efficient and selective conversion of alkanes into valuable products.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临重大挑战，特别是由于需要高温来激活甲烷，而在这种温度下，所期望的氧化物会迅速氧化成不需要的碳氧化物。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载系统，在解决这些问题中起着关键作用。催化剂性质的相互作用，如金属-氧键的极性和金属-氧p键强度，影响了过程的效率。像V和Mo这样的高价过渡金属氧化物因其高度的活性和选择性而受到关注，这可能是因为这些因素之间的平衡。隔离技术可能有助于通过限制反应中间体来解决选择性问题，从而防止不希望的反应。

就反应机制而言，C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽象是关键步骤。提出的H抽象机制与实验证据的一致性表明，该机制是高价过渡金属氧化物中烷烃活化的可行途径。这一机制在各种催化剂中的可行性为有效和选择性地将烷烃转化为有价值的产品提供了潜力。
