[1] "The direct conversion of natural gas into chemical feedstocks or liquid fuels is currently attracting much interest."
[2] "Partial oxidation of methane into formaldehyde or methanol is one o f the most challenging subjects in catalysis research."
[3] "It is becoming apparent that a high formaldehyde yield is obtained if the deposited quantity of M0033.8 or V2056 is limited to less than monolayer coverage of the silica surface."
[4] "Formation of C2 compounds or methanol is observed if radical reactions in the gas phase are concomitant."
[5] "The activity of silica catalysts for formaldehyde formation depends strongly on their origin and history."
[6] "The role of various additives is also interesting for the study of new catalytic promoters."
[7] "As these metal ions are expected to be very active for redox reactions, they were added in much smaller quantities than are usually used for the promotion of silica catalysts."
[8] "Unpromoted silica itself shows a certain activity for formaldehyde formation."
[9] "Addition of small amounts of metal ions can enhance the catalytic activity for the formaldehyde formation as well as the formation of carbon oxides."
[10] "Such a trade-off relationship between formaldehyde selectivity and conversion of methane is often observed for promoted silica catalysts."
[11] "This result strongly suggests that the observed high formaldehyde yield on the Fe-promoted silica is a consequence of a synergistic interaction between silica and the highly dispersed Fe ions on it."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion in this process presents significant challenges. Catalysts such as Fe3+ ions added to silica can notably enhance the catalytic activity in the formation of formaldehyde from methane oxidation by oxygen. The activity of silica catalysts for formaldehyde formation is influenced by their origin, history, and surface characteristics. The introduction of metal ions, particularly 3d transition metals, creates a synergistic interaction with the silica surface, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This synergy is crucial in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for efficient oxygen activation and facilitates the desired C-H bond cleavage reactions. The trade-off between formaldehyde selectivity and methane conversion highlights the delicate balance required in optimizing the catalyst system for ODH processes. The presence of redox centers on the catalyst surface plays a pivotal role in activating oxygen from the gas phase, thereby enhancing the overall process efficiency. Understanding and controlling these interactions are essential for developing more effective and selective catalysts for ODH reactions.
