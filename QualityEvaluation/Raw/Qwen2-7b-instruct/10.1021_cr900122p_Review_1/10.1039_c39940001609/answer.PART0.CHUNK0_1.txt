The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the intricate nature of alkane activation and the formation of desired products. Catalysts such as Fe, Co, and Cr, when deposited on silica, can significantly enhance the activity for formaldehyde formation during the oxidation of methane. This is attributed to the redox activity of these metal ions on the silica surface, which facilitates the activation of oxygen from the gas phase. However, the activity of silica catalysts for formaldehyde formation is highly dependent on their origin and history, with some showing superior performance even without the addition of metal ions. The role of additives in enhancing catalytic activity is also a subject of interest. The observed synergy between silica and the highly dispersed Fe ions on its surface contributes to the high formaldehyde yield on Fe-promoted silica catalysts. In contrast, other metal oxides on silica did not show the same enhancement in formaldehyde formation, suggesting that the observed high yield is a result of a synergistic interaction between silica and the dispersed Fe ions. This indicates that the presence of metal ions in the catalyst can significantly influence the efficiency of the ODH process by facilitating the activation of alkane molecules and promoting the formation of desired products through C-H bond activation and M-alkyl intermediates. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the active sites to prevent unwanted side reactions, thus improving the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及到各种催化剂之间的复杂相互作用，包括体金属氧化物和支持系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于烷烃激活和形成所需产物的复杂性。铁、钴和铬等金属离子在二氧化硅上的沉积可以显著增强甲醇形成期间甲烷氧化的活性。这归因于这些金属离子在二氧化硅表面的还原性活动，它促进了气体相中氧气的活化。然而，二氧化硅催化剂对甲醛形成的活性高度依赖于它们的起源和历史，一些催化剂即使不添加金属离子也表现出更优性能。添加剂在增强催化活性中的作用也是研究的重点。在二氧化硅表面分散的铁离子之间观察到的协同作用导致了铁促进二氧化硅催化剂上甲醛产量的提高。相比之下，其他金属氧化物在二氧化硅上的表现没有显示出相同的甲醛形成增强效果，这表明观察到的高产量是二氧化硅和分散的铁离子之间协同作用的结果。这表明金属离子的存在可以显著影响ODH过程的效率，通过促进烷烃分子的活化和促进通过C-H键活化和M-烷基中间体形成所需产品。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过限制活性位点以防止不必要的副反应，从而提高ODH过程的整体效率。
