[1] "Partial oxidation of methane into formaldehyde or methanol is one of the most challenging subjects in catalysis research."
[2] "It is becoming apparent that a high formaldehyde yield is obtained if the deposited quantity of M0033.8 or V2056 is limited to less than monolayer coverage of the silica surface."
[3] "Formation of C2 compounds or methanol is observed if radical reactions in the gas phase are concomitant."
[4] "The activity of silica catalysts for formaldehyde formation depends strongly on their origin and history."
[5] "We report here how the addition of 3d transition metal ions can increase the catalytic activity of silica in the direct partial oxidation of methane by oxygen."
[6] "Unpromoted silica itself shows a certain activity for formaldehyde formation."
[7] "Addition of small amounts of metal ions can enhance the catalytic activity for the formaldehyde formation as well as the formation of carbon oxides."
[8] "The effect is most pronounced for Fe-promoted silica, which shows a tenfold increase in yield of formaldehyde compared with that observed for the simple silica catalyst."
[9] "This result strongly suggests that the observed high formaldehyde yield on the Fe-promoted silica is a consequence of a synergistic interaction between silica and the highly dispersed Fe ions on it."
[10] "As Fe is believed to provide a very active redox centre, even a very small amount of Fe seems to be enough for the oxygen activation on silica."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) presents significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. The interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in process efficiency. The literature indicates that high formaldehyde yields can be achieved by limiting the amount of metal catalysts such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, or V to less than monolayer coverage on the silica surface. The presence of radicals in the gas phase can lead to the formation of C2 compounds or methanol, highlighting the importance of controlling the reaction pathways. The activity of silica catalysts for formaldehyde formation is influenced by their origin, history, and surface properties, such as surface area, contaminating sodium, and defect sites. The addition of 3d transition metal ions, especially iron, can significantly enhance the catalytic activity of silica in the partial oxidation of methane, demonstrating a synergistic interaction between the metal ions and the silica surface. This synergy is attributed to the active redox centers provided by the metal ions, enabling efficient oxygen activation on the silica catalyst.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临重大挑战。各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括单质金属氧化物和负载系统，在提高过程效率中起着关键作用。文献表明，通过将金属催化剂（如锰、铁、钴、镍、铜、锌或钒）限制在小于单层覆盖度的硅胶表面上，可以获得较高的甲醛产率。气体相中的自由基的存在可能导致C2化合物或甲醇的形成，这强调了控制反应途径的重要性。硅胶催化剂对甲醛形成的活性受其起源、历史以及表面性质的影响，如表面积、含钠量和缺陷点等。向硅胶催化剂中添加3d过渡金属离子，尤其是铁，可以显著增强其部分甲烷氧化的催化活性，显示出硅与金属离子之间的作用协同性。这种协同作用归因于金属离子提供的活性还原中心，使氧气在硅胶催化剂上得到有效激活。
