[1] "Catalyst samples preferentially exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes have been characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy with three-dimensional imaging, BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy."
[2] "Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the MoO sites."
[3] "These sites are then preferentially replenished through bulk diffusion of oxygen."
[4] "The bridging MoOMo sites, on the other hand, appear to be involved in complete oxidation and are more easily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen."
