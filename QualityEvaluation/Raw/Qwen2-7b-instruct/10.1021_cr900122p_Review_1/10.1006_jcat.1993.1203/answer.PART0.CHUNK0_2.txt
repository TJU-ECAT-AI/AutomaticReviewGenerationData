[1] "Catalysts samples preferentially exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes have been characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy with three-dimensional imaging, BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy."
[2] "In addition to isotopic labeling studies, these catalysts have also been examined under steady-state reaction conditions to assess the effect of the concentration of gas-phase oxygen."
[3] "Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the MoO sites, These sites are then preferentially replenished through bulk diffusion of oxygen."
[4] "The bridging MoOMo sites, on the other hand, appear to be involved in complete oxidation and are more easily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen."

The study focused on the transient isotopic labeling technique applied to the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over MoO3 catalysts. The catalyst samples were characterized using multiple methods such as scanning electron microscopy, BET surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy. The results indicated that the synthesis of formaldehyde occurs through the use of lattice oxygen at the MoO sites, which are subsequently replenished by bulk oxygen diffusion. Conversely, the bridging MoOMo sites are primarily responsible for complete oxidation and are readily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen.

研究集中在对MoO3催化剂在甲烷部分氧化为甲醛过程中的瞬时同位素标记技术。通过扫描电子显微镜、BET表面积分析、X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱和激光拉曼光谱等多种方法对催化剂样品进行了表征。结果显示，甲醛的生成是通过MoO位点利用晶格氧进行的，随后通过本体氧扩散优先补充。相反，桥接的MoOMo位点主要负责完全氧化，并且容易通过气相氧再生。
