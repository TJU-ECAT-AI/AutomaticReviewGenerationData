Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

[1] "Catalysts samples preferentially exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes have been characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy with three-dimensional imaging, BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy."
[2] "Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the MoO sites, These sites are then preferentially replenished through bulk diffusion of oxygen."
[3] "The bridging MoOMo sites, on the other hand, appear to be involved in complete oxidation and are more easily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen."

The study investigates the oxygen insertion pathway over MoO3 catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. Catalyst samples exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes were characterized using various techniques. The production of formaldehyde occurs through the use of lattice oxygen at MoO sites, which are replenished by bulk diffusion of oxygen. Bridging MoOMo sites are primarily involved in complete oxidation and regenerate more easily through gas-phase oxygen.

The study focused on the transient isotopic labeling technique applied to the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over MoO3 catalysts. The catalyst samples were characterized using multiple methods such as scanning electron microscopy, BET surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy. The results indicated that the synthesis of formaldehyde occurs through the use of lattice oxygen at the MoO sites, which are subsequently replenished by bulk oxygen diffusion. Conversely, the bridging MoOMo sites are primarily responsible for complete oxidation and are readily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen.

The study focuses on the transient isotopic labeling of methane partial oxidation to formaldehyde over MoO3 catalysts, particularly examining the role of basal (010) and side (100) plane exposures. Various characterization methods were used, such as scanning electron microscopy, BET surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy. Under steady-state reaction conditions, the catalysts were tested with different gas-phase oxygen concentrations. The findings indicate that HCHO formation occurs through lattice oxygen utilization at MoO sites, which are subsequently replenished by bulk oxygen diffusion. Meanwhile, bridging MoOMo sites are associated with complete oxidation processes, regenerating more efficiently with gas-phase oxygen.
