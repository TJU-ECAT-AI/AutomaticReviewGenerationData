[1] "Catalysts samples preferentially exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes have been characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy with three-dimensional imaging, BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy."
[2] "In addition to isotopic labeling studies, these catalysts have also been examined under steady-state reaction conditions to assess the effect of the concentration of gas-phase oxygen."
[3] "Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the MoO sites, These sites are then preferentially replenished through bulk diffusion of oxygen."
[4] "The bridging MoOMo sites, on the other hand, appear to be involved in complete oxidation and are more easily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen."

The study focuses on the transient isotopic labeling of methane partial oxidation to formaldehyde over MoO3 catalysts, particularly examining the role of basal (010) and side (100) plane exposures. Various characterization methods were used, such as scanning electron microscopy, BET surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy. Under steady-state reaction conditions, the catalysts were tested with different gas-phase oxygen concentrations. The findings indicate that HCHO formation occurs through lattice oxygen utilization at MoO sites, which are subsequently replenished by bulk oxygen diffusion. Meanwhile, bridging MoOMo sites are associated with complete oxidation processes, regenerating more efficiently with gas-phase oxygen.

研究专注于MoO3催化剂上甲烷部分氧化至甲醛的瞬时同位素标记，特别关注基底（010）和侧面（100）平面的暴露。使用了多种表征方法，包括扫描电子显微镜、BET表面积分析、X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱和激光拉曼光谱。在稳态反应条件下，对催化剂进行了不同气相氧浓度的测试。结果表明，HCHO的形成通过MoO位点的晶格氧利用发生，随后通过本体氧扩散优先补充。相反，桥接的MoOMo位点与完全氧化过程相关联，并且更容易通过气体相氧再生。
