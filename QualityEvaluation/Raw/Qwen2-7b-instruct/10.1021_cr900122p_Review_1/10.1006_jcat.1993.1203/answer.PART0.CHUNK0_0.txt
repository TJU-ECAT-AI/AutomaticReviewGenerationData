[1] "Catalysts samples preferentially exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes have been characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy with three-dimensional imaging, BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy."
[2] "Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the MoO sites, These sites are then preferentially replenished through bulk diffusion of oxygen."
[3] "The bridging MoOMo sites, on the other hand, appear to be involved in complete oxidation and are more easily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen."

The study investigates the oxygen insertion pathway over MoO3 catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. Catalyst samples exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes were characterized using various techniques. The production of formaldehyde occurs through the use of lattice oxygen at MoO sites, which are replenished by bulk diffusion of oxygen. Bridging MoOMo sites are primarily involved in complete oxidation and regenerate more easily through gas-phase oxygen.

研究探讨了MoO3催化剂上甲烷部分氧化至甲醛的氧插入途径。暴露于基底（010）和侧面（100）的催化剂样品使用各种技术进行了表征。甲醛的产生通过MoO位点利用晶格氧进行，这些位点通过宏观扩散补充氧。另一方面，桥接的MoOMo位点主要参与完全氧化，并且更容易通过气相氧再生。
