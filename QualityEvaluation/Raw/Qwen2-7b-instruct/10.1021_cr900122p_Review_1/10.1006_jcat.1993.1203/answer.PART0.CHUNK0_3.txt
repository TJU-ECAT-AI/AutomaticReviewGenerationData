[1] "Catalysts samples preferentially exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes have been characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy with three-dimensional imaging, BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy."
[2] "In addition to isotopic labeling studies, these catalysts have also been examined under steady-state reaction conditions to assess the effect of the concentration of gas-phase oxygen."
[3] "Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the MoO sites."
[4] "These sites are then preferentially replenished through bulk diffusion of oxygen."
[5] "The bridging MoOMo sites, on the other hand, appear to be involved in complete oxidation and are more easily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen."

The study focuses on the oxygen insertion pathway over MoO3 catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde, using transient isotopic labeling under steady-state conditions. Catalyst samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, BET surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy. The results indicate that the production of formaldehyde occurs through the utilization of lattice oxygen at MoO sites, which are replenished by bulk diffusion of oxygen. Meanwhile, the bridging MoOMo sites are involved in complete oxidation and regenerate more easily through gas-phase oxygen.

研究集中在钼酸盐催化剂上，用于甲烷部分氧化为甲醛的氧插入途径，在稳态反应条件下使用瞬时同位素标记。对催化剂样品进行了扫描电子显微镜、BET表面积分析、X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱和激光拉曼光谱的表征。结果表明，甲醛的产生通过MoO位点利用晶格氧进行，这些位点通过体扩散补充氧气。另一方面，桥接的MoOMo位点参与完全氧化，并更容易通过气相氧再生。
