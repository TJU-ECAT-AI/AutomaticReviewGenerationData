          [1] "The possible involvement of Pd(I1)-vinyli-dine and Pd(I1)-allenyl complexes could be excluded (26, 27)."
          [2] "In the addition of alk-oxyarenes to activated alkenes, the involve-ment of the carbocations from alkenes may be possible."
          [3] "This process offers a general, simple, and efficient method for converting simple arenes directly to potentially useful compounds in one step under mild conditions."
          [4] "This method should have many applications in organic and medical chemistry and possibly be applied by chemical and pharmaceutical industries."

          The ODH process involves the use of various catalysts, including Pd(II) species, and exclusion of Pd(I)-vinyli-dine and Pd(I)-allenyl complexes. It also mentions the possibility of alkene carbocations in the addition of alk-oxyarenes to activated alkenes. The process provides an efficient, straightforward, and versatile method for converting simple arenes into valuable compounds in one step under mild conditions, with potential applications in organic and medical chemistry, and use by chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
