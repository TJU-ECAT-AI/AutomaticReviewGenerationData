[1] "Introduction and Scope: The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions."
[2] "The scope of this article is to review fundamental kinetic models used in analysis of the experimental data and the proposed mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes."
[3] "Types of Catalysts Used in ODH of Light Alkanes: The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane, n-butane, etc., can be approximately classified into three groups."
[4] "Catalysts for ODH of Ethane: Catalysts based on alkali and alkaline earth ions and oxides show selective behavior in this reaction, but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K)."
[5] "Mechanism of ODH of Alkanes: Though the mechanisms of ODH reactions proposed by different authors differ from each other in some details and depend on the type of catalyst and alkane, some common features can be found."
[6] "Kinetic Models for ODH of Light Alkanes: As the basis for the development of rate equations, it is postulated that a gas-phase chemical reaction, when catalyzed by a solid, actually occurs on the surface of the catalyst and involves the reaction of molecules or atoms that are adsorbed by the active centers of the surface."
[7] "Kinetics of ODH of Ethane: Many papers have been devoted to the study of the catalytic properties of various materials used in ODHE, but few have considered the kinetic aspects of this reaction."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are discussed, with the document mentioning the need for site isolation to address selectivity issues. The factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and the role of site isolation plays a crucial part in enhancing selectivity.

The document provides insights into the proposed reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. It explains how these mechanisms contribute to the overall process and how they are influenced by the type of catalyst and alkane being used. The efficiency of the process is affected by the ability of the catalyst to selectively activate the C-H bonds and convert them into alkenes.

Site isolation refers to the separation of active sites on the catalyst surface, which helps in reducing cross-reactions and improving selectivity. By isolating active sites, the catalyst can focus on the desired reaction pathway, thereby increasing the yield of the desired product. This technique is particularly useful in addressing the challenge of achieving high selectivity in ODH reactions, especially when dealing with multiple reaction pathways that can lead to the formation of unwanted by-products.

In conclusion, the document underscores the importance of understanding the reaction mechanisms, optimizing catalyst design, and employing strategies like site isolation to enhance the efficiency of ODH processes. The collective consideration of these factors is crucial for achieving high conversion and selectivity in the production of alkenes from alkanes through oxidative dehydrogenation.
