[1] "Work in our laboratory has demonstrated that on MgO surfaces O- ions, formed from N,O, react readily with simple alkanes by abstracting a hydrogen atom at room temperature."
[2] "These results parallel those of gas-phase studies involving O- and alkanes."
[3] "Using molybdenum supported on silica, Lipatkina et al. also investigated the stoichiometric reaction of O- with CH4 and confirmed the formation of CH3. radicals."
[4] "Recent results from our laboratory have demonstrated that alkyl radicals, formed by the reaction between surface O- ions and alkanes over Mo/SiO2 catalyst, are part of a catalytic cycle."
[5] "In this paper we report on the selective conversion of methane to ethylene and ethane at relatively high conversions, using O2 as the oxidant."
[6] "Ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good selectivities when CH4 and O2 are passed over Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures."
[7] "These C2 compounds are formed via the coupling of the gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced mainly by the reaction of CH4 with active [Li'O-] centers on MgO."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights the role of catalysts in facilitating the conversion of alkanes to alkenes and alcohols. Key factors influencing the process efficiency include the ability of catalysts to activate alkane bonds, generate reactive intermediates such as alkyl radicals, and control the selectivity towards desired products. The use of bulk metal oxides and supported systems allows for the manipulation of reaction pathways, with the latter offering advantages in terms of site isolation, potentially mitigating unwanted side reactions. Supported metal oxides, like Li-promoted MgO, enable high selectivity and conversion by enabling the formation of active species such as [Li'O-] centers, which abstract hydrogen atoms from alkanes to form radicals. The Li/MgO catalyst system, lacking metal ions with variable oxidation states, provides a unique platform for ODH processes. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals, produced by the reaction of CH4 with these active sites, leads to the formation of alkenes. This system demonstrates the potential for achieving high yields and selectivities in ODH, particularly when optimized for temperature and reactant pressures. The role of site isolation in these catalysts helps in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，文献强调了催化剂在促进烷烃转化为烯烃和醇中的作用。影响过程效率的关键因素包括催化剂激活烷烃键的能力、生成活性中间体（如烷基自由基）以及控制向目标产物的选择性。使用大块金属氧化物和支持体系允许调整反应途径，后者通过提供位点隔离的优势，在一定程度上减少了不需要的副反应。支持金属氧化物，如锂促进的镁氧，通过使烷基自由基形成活性物种（如[锂O-]中心），能够从烷烃中提取氢原子形成自由基，从而提高选择性和转化率。Li/MgO催化剂系统缺乏具有可变氧化态的金属离子，提供了一种独特的平台进行ODH过程。通过该系统，气体相甲基自由基的耦合，由CH4与这些活性位点的反应产生，导致烯烃的形成。此系统展示了实现高产率和选择性的潜力，特别是在优化温度和反应物压力时。这些催化剂系统中位点隔离的作用有助于解决选择性问题，通过减少不希望的副产品的形成来最小化。
