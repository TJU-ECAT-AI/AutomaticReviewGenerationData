Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the intricate nature of the reactions, which involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction processes. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by multiple factors, including the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, which helps in directing the reaction towards desired products rather than undesired ones. 

For instance, the use of magnesium oxide (MgO) surfaces facilitates the formation of 0- ions from nitrogen oxide (N,O), which can react readily with simple alkanes by abstracting a hydrogen atom under room temperature conditions. Similarly, the employment of molybdenum (Mo) supported on silica catalysts showcases the potential for alkyl radicals, produced through the reaction between 0- ions and alkanes, to participate in catalytic cycles. However, the utility of these systems is somewhat limited when nitrogen dioxide (N 2 0) is utilized as the oxidant, suggesting the need for alternative oxidants for broader applicability.

To gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism, researchers determine the partial pressure of methane (CH4) converted into various products as a function of the pressure of each reactant. This approach allows for a detailed examination of the pathways leading to the formation of different products, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), ethane (C2H6), and ethylene (C2H4).

Furthermore, by comparing runs where methane (CH4) or ethane (C2H6) serves as the reactant, insights into the relative contributions of different pathways become evident. For example, in a scenario where both CH4 and C2H6 are present, the amount of ethylene (C2H4) produced is typically less than when only C2H6 is utilized. This observation highlights the competitive nature of the reactions occurring at the catalyst surface.

Conclusively, at temperatures around 620 degrees Celsius and with low conversions of methane (CH4), the predominant pathway for the formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is not the further oxidation of ethane (C2H6). This finding underscores the importance of carefully controlling reaction conditions and catalyst properties to optimize the selectivity and conversion rates, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及理解各种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）之间的复杂相互作用。在实现高选择性和转化率时面临的挑战通常源于反应的复杂性，涉及到C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H抽取过程。这些过程的效率受多种因素的影响，包括催化剂对活性位点的隔离能力，这有助于将反应导向所需产品而不是副产品。

例如，镁氧化物（MgO）表面允许从氮氧化物（N,O）形成0-离子，该离子可以在室温条件下与简单的烷烃迅速反应，通过抽取一个氢原子。同样，钼（Mo）支撑在硅酸盐催化剂上的使用展示了通过0-离子和烷烃之间的反应形成的烷基自由基参与催化循环的可能性。然而，当使用氮氧化物（N 2 0）作为氧化剂时，这些系统的实用性受到限制，这表明需要其他氧化剂以实现更广泛的应用。

为了深入了解反应机制，研究人员确定甲烷（CH4）转化为各种产物的分压与每种反应物压力的关系。这种方法允许对导致不同产物形成的路径进行详细检查，如一氧化碳（CO）、二氧化碳（CO2）、乙烷（C2H6）和乙烯（C2H4）。

此外，通过比较使用甲烷（CH4）或乙烷（C2H6）为反应物的情况，可以获得不同途径相对贡献的洞察。例如，在同时存在甲烷（CH4）和乙烷（C2H6）的情况下，生成的乙烯（C2H4）量通常少于仅使用C2H6时。这一观察结果强调了催化剂表面反应的竞争性质。

总之，在大约620摄氏度和低甲烷（CH4）转化率下，碳氧化合物（CO）和二氧化碳（CO2）的主要形成途径不是进一步氧化乙烷（C2H6）。这一发现突出了控制反应条件和催化剂特性以优化选择性和转化率的重要性，从而提高氧化脱氢过程的整体效率。
