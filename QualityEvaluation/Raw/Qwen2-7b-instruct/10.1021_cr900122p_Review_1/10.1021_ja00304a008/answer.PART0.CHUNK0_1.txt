Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we see a complex interplay between various catalysts. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems like Li/MgO exhibit unique capabilities. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the intricate nature of these processes. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation is essential for addressing selectivity issues, enhancing the overall efficiency of the process.
