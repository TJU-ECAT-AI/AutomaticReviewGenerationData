[1] "Vanadia-silica catalysts were prepared from ammonium metavanadate and silica."
[2] "The vanadia-silica catalyst is clearly more active than the molybdena-silica system, although on V205-Si02, selectivity to formaldehyde appears to fall off more rapidly with conversion at all but the highest temperatures investigated."
[3] "The selectivity relationships were also used to draw the lines in Figs. la through c,which correspond to the model predictions at each temperature."
[4] "Formaldehyde is the only primary product in the V205-Si02 system, in contrast to Mo03-SiOz , where both formaldehyde and CO2 are formed directly from methane via parallel pathways."
[5] "The mathematical model is built on the assumption that the reaction rate is zero or- der in oxygen concentration."

1. Vanadia-silica catalysts were synthesized using ammonium metavanadate and silica. These catalysts are more active than molybdena-silica systems, yet they show a faster decline in formaldehyde selectivity as conversion increases, except at high temperatures.
2. The selectivity patterns predicted by the mathematical model align with the experimental outcomes in Figs. la through c. 
3. In the vanadia-silica system, formaldehyde is the sole primary product, contrasting with the molybdena-silica system where both formaldehyde and carbon dioxide are produced directly from methane via parallel pathways.
4. The model assumes a zero-order reaction rate in oxygen concentration. 
5. The vanadia-silica catalyst demonstrates high selectivity for formaldehyde formation from methane at low conversions, but this selectivity decreases rapidly as conversion increases. At a fixed methane conversion, increasing temperature enhances formaldehyde selectivity.

1. 使用硫酸铵和二氧化硅合成范德催化剂。这些催化剂比钼酸盐-二氧化硅体系更活跃，但在除高温外的所有情况下，它们的甲醛选择性随转化率的增加而更快下降。
2. 数学模型预测的结果与实验结果在图la至c中的线对应。
3. 在范德催化剂系统中，甲醛是唯一的初级产物，与钼酸盐-二氧化硅系统不同，后者通过并行途径直接从甲烷产生甲醛和二氧化碳。
4. 模型假设氧浓度下的反应速率是零阶。
5. 在给定的甲烷转化率下，随着温度的升高，甲醛的选择性得到提高。
