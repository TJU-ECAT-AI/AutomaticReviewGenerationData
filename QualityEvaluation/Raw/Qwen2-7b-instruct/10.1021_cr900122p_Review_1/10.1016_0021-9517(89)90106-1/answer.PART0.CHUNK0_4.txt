[1] "Vanadia-silica catalysts were prepared from ammonium metavanadate and silica."
[2] "A kinetic model that describes the conversion and selectivity for V205-SiO2 catalysts has been proposed."
[3] "The vanadia-silica catalyst is clearly more active than the molybdena-silica system, although on V205-Si02, selectivity to formaldehyde appears to fall off more rapidly with conversion at all but the highest temperatures investigated."
[4] "The temperature dependence is different in the two systems, with formaldehyde selectivity varying much more strongly with temperature (at a given conversion) in the Vz05-Si02 case."
[5] "A significant difference between the two catalysts is that unlike its molybdena counterpart, which forms HCHO and CO2:by parallel reaction pathways, vanadia-silica catalyzes the formation of CO* via a sequential mechanism."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to convert alkanes into alkene and hydrogen. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by controlling the rate and direction of reactions. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by providing distinct sites for different reactions, thus enhancing the selectivity towards desired products.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及使用各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，将烷烃转化为烯烃和氢。实现高选择性和转化的挑战通过机制如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体形成和2H抽象来解决。这些因素共同影响过程效率，通过控制反应速率和方向来控制。通过提供不同的位点以进行不同反应，位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，从而增强对目标产物的选择性。
