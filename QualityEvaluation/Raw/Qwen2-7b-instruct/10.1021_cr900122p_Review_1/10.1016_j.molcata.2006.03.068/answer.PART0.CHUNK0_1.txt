The document discusses the advancements in understanding the transformation of C2C4 alkanes using acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts. It covers the activation mechanisms, including the carbenium-chain and protolytic mechanisms. It also examines various transformations such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, isobutanebutene alkylation, and benzene alkylation. The paper further explores the chemistry of alkylation and strategies to limit deactivation. In the context of metal zeolite catalysts, it delves into light alkane aromatization, n-butane hydroisomerization, dehydroisomerization, and alkylation of aromatics with small alkanes. The general conclusion summarizes the key findings and implications of these studies.
