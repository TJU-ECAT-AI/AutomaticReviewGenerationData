[1] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."
[2] "Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in mixture with alkenes: isobutanebutene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered."
[3] "This work focuses on the use of acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts for the activation of C2C4 alkanes."
[4] "The carbenium-chain mechanism, the protolytic mechanism, and the disproportionation and isomerization of light alkanes over acid zeolites are discussed."
[5] "The chemistry of alkylation, how to limit deactivation, and novel regeneration methods are addressed."
[6] "The bifunctional mechanism of light alkane aromatization over metal zeolite catalysts is explored."

This review paper discusses the advancements in understanding the transformation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts. It covers the activation mechanisms, reaction schemes, and nature of the active sites involved in converting these alkanes into more valuable products. The focus is on transformations such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, isobutanebutene alkylation, and benzene alkylation with ethane or propane. Various mechanisms like the carbenium-chain, protolytic, disproportionation, and isomerization are explained. The paper also addresses the chemistry of alkylation, strategies to limit deactivation, and innovative regeneration methods. In addition, it explores the bifunctional mechanism for light alkane aromatization over metal zeolite catalysts. Hydroisomerization and dehydroisomerization of n-butane, as well as the alkylation of aromatics with small alkanes, are also analyzed.
