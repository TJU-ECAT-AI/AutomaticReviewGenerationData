<p>This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites.</p>
<p>Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in mixture with alkenes: isobutanebutene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered.</p>

This document reviews the advancements in understanding the transformations of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, focusing on activation mechanisms, reaction schemes, and active sites. It considers transformations such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, and alkanes mixed with alkenes undergoing isobutanebutene alkylation or benzene alkylation with ethane or propane. The review covers the mechanisms, including carbenium-chain and protolytic mechanisms, disproportionation and isomerization, light alkane aromatization, alkylation of isobutane with n-butene, and transformations over metal zeolite catalysts. It discusses the main features of light alkane aromatization, the bifunctional nature of the process, dehydrogenation steps, composition of working catalysts, and the comparison between zinc and gallium-based catalysts. The review also addresses the hydroisomerization and dehydroisomerization of n-butane and the alkylation of aromatics with small alkanes, providing thermodynamic considerations and the use of platinum or palladium catalysts. Finally, it concludes with general remarks on the topic.
