The document provides an overview of the advancements in understanding the activation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, including their transformations into more valuable products such as isomerization, aromatization, and alkylation processes. It discusses the activation mechanisms, the influence of catalyst properties on reaction outcomes, and the chemistry involved in alkylation reactions, particularly focusing on the use of zeolite catalysts in these processes. The review also addresses the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, considering factors such as catalyst type, site isolation, and reaction mechanisms involving C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The collective interplay of these factors influences process efficiency and addresses selectivity issues through careful catalyst design and optimization.
