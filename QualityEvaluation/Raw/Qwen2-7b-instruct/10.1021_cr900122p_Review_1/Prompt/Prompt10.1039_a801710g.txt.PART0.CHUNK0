In situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopyon-line activity measurements Signicance of Crn species (n = 2, 3 and 6) in n-butane dehydrogenation catalyzed by supported chromium oxide catalysts Bert M. Weckhuysen,* Abdelhamid Bensalem and Robert A. Schoonheydt Centrum voor Oppervlaktechemie en Katalyse, Departement Interfasechemie, Katholieke Universiteit L euven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, 3001 Heverlee, Belgium The dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated at 500 C by in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopyon-line activity measurements as a function of the reaction time (060 min), the support composi- tion ratio) and the Cr loading (08 wt.%). The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period,(SiO2 : Al2O3 during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and and cracking products and are

formed. After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene are produced with a selectivity up to 90%. The catalytic activity increases with increasing Cr content and content of the support, and is maximum after 515 min on stream. A Al2O3 relation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon the reduction of Cr6 has been established.
Introduction Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in chemical industries for the production of important commodity chemi- cals. Indeed, several large volume industrial processes rely on supported chromium oxides as a heterogeneous catalyst.
Chromium-on-silica is the famous Philips polymerization catalyst, responsible for about one third of the world pro- duction of high density polyethylene (HDPE).1,2 This system is still developing, and forms the basis of a new generation of supported mono-alkene polymerization catalysts, as an alter- native to the recently commercialized metallocenes. Similarly,chromium-on-alumina is used as a light paraffin dehydroge- nation catalyst employed in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes.3,4 The Houdry CATOFIN process is responsible for approximately 50% of the catalytically derived world production of isobutane, for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and 50% of the catalytically generated propyl- ene, mostly used for the production of polypropylene.
The industrial importance of supported chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research towards the elucidation of the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relation with catalytic performances.5h12 The state-of-the-art of these catalysts has been recently summarized in a review paper.5 It has been shown that almost all previous characterization studies were conducted under controlled atmospheres, i.e., hydrated, dehy- drated and reduced conditions, and the data obtained could not be directly related to catalytic data. Therefore, in general,spectroscopic techniques have to be developed which allow measurements under conditions as close as possible to real catalytic conditions. Thus, in situ spectroscopic studies, com- bined with on-line activity/selectivity measurements,are required to fully understand the catalytic action of supported metal oxide catalysts.
In this work, we have investigated supported chromium oxide catalysts in n-butane dehydrogenation reactions by using in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopy. This allows us to probe Cr6, Cr3 and Cr2 in reaction condi- tions, while the reaction products (CO/CO2 , CH4 , C2H6 ,) can be monitored by on-line gas

chromatography. The goal of this study is then to address the role of Crn (with n \ 6, 3 and 2) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The results will be discussed in relation to recent publications on the nature of the active dehydrogenation site.

A schematic drawing and the technical details of this cell are given in recent papers.14,15 The white reectance standard (Kodak) was used to take a baseline at 25 C BaSO4 in the Praying Mantis cell. The thickness of the catalyst bed was 3 mm, and the amount of the catalyst used was ca. 4065 mg. The catalyst was rst treated in oxygen in the in situ cell at 550 C for 1 h, and then cooled in He to 500 C. The cata- lyst was then subjected to an 18% n-butane stream in He (50 ml min1) at 1 atm. The measured in situ DRS spectra were processed with Grams/386 (Galactic Industries Corp). On-line gas chromatography analysis was done with an HP 5830 GC instrument equipped with an FID detector, six-way valve inlet system, and a packed column lled with n-octane/porasil-C (100120 mesh, Durapack, Applied Science Laboratories). The thermodynamically expected conversion at 500 C will be ca. 20%. However, as will be shown below, the conversions obtained in the in situ cell are much lower. Indeed, the best catalyst employed in this study has a conversion below 10%.
Thus, the in situ DRS cell cannot be considered as an ideal xed bed reactor, and gas by-pass and eventually an inhomo- geneous temperature prole have to be invoked to explain the lower conversions.
Results Catalytic performance The dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated at 500 C in the in situ cell as a function of the support composition, the Cr loading,and the reaction time. As an example, we will discuss the cata- lytic performance of the 0.2 wt.% Cr/SA-0 catalyst in detail (Fig. 1). Other Cr catalysts had a similar activity and selec- tivity pattern, although their exact conversions/selectivities were dierent. It is also important to notice that the catalytic activity of the empty in situ cell at 500 C was below 0.10%,while the selectivities towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene were ca. 50%.
Fig. 1A shows that the catalytic activity of the 0.2 wt.% Cr/SA-0 catalyst reached a maximum after 6 min on-stream,and decreased with increasing reaction time. In addition, the selectivity pattern of the reaction was quite complex (Fig. 1B).

(ca. 50%) for 0.2 wt.% Cr/SA-40 and Cr/SA-60 catalysts. This must be due to the acidity of the silicaalumina supports.
After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene were produced selectively. The selectivity towards alkenes reached a maximum of ca. 90% after 10 min, and decreased slightly with increasing time on-stream.
Fig. 2 compares the catalytic activity of 0.2 wt.% Cr cata- lysts as a function of the support composition (SiO2 : Al2O3 ratio). The dehydrogenation activities were measured after 10 min on-stream. It is clear that the catalytic activity decreased from 0.44% for a Cr/SA-0 catalyst, through 0.35% for a Cr/ SA-40 to 0.18% for a Cr/SA-100 catalyst. Thus, the dehydro- genation activity decreased with increasing content of SiO2 the support. The dependency of the dehydrogenation activity on Cr loading is illustrated in Fig. 3 for catalysts. It Cr/Al2O3 is shown that the conversion towards alkenes increased almost linear with increasing Cr loading.
Signicance of Crn (with n = 6, 3 and 2) in n-butane dehydrogenation In situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectra were monitored between 300 and 800 nm as a function of time on-stream for Fig. 2 A, Conversion (%) and, B, Cr2 : Cr3 ratio as a function of the support composition for n-butane dehydrogenation at 500 C over
0.2 wt.% Cr catalysts. The Cr2 : Cr3 ratio was derived from pre-
vious CO reduction experiments.5,17 The DRS spectra obtained after CO reduction of the supported Cr catalysts at 600 C for 30 min were deconvoluted in a set of Gaussian bands typically for Cr3 and Cr2.
The ratio of the absorption maxima was used to determine the Cr2 : Cr3 ratio.

View Article Online each supported chromium oxide catalyst treated in n-butane at 500 C. The scan time was 1 min, and 60 dierent spectra were recorded during 60 min. An example of a set of in situ diuse reectance spectra is given in Fig. 4 for the 0.2 wt.% Cr/SA-0 catalyst. Fig. 4 shows a gradual decrease of the absorption maximum at ca. 360 nm with increasing reaction time at the expense of a new weak band with an absorption maximum at ca. 590 nm. Fig. 4 also shows the presence of an isobestic point at ca. 490 nm, suggesting the presence of two dierent Cr species. The rst absorption band is typical for the presence of Cr6, whereas the broad absorption band at 590 nm is indicative for the presence of Cr3.5,16,17 In the case of Cr/SA-100 catalysts, the absorption maximum of reduced Cr is at ca. 625 nm, which is typical for the formation of Cr2,although some Cr3 may contribute to the spectra as well.
Indeed, the absorption maximum at 590 nm shifts to higher energy with decreasing content of the support, which is Al2O3 indicative of an increase of the Cr2 : Cr3 ratio with decreas- ing content of the support. Thus, the dierences in Cr Al2O3 speciation are related to the support composition, i.e., mainly Cr3 on a mixture of Cr3 and Cr2 on Al2O3 , SiO2  Al2O3 and, mainly Cr2 on SiO2.5,17 By monitoring the intensity of the absorption bands at ca. 590625 nm and 360 nm as a function of time on-stream, one can measure the amount of Cr6 and Cr3@2 during cata- lytic action, according to eqn.

reectance of the Cr catalyst; K and S, the absorption and scattering coefficients; k, a proportionality coefficient and C(Crn), the amount of Crn. However, it is important to notice here that previous work5,17 has shown that eqn. (1) is only valid for low loaded Cr catalysts and, as a consequence,the values will deviate from linearity at higher Cr IKM(Crn) loadings. As an example, the intensity proles of the 360 and 590 nm band for the 0.2 wt.% Cr/SA-0 catalyst treated in n- butane are given in Fig. 5, and similar plots were obtained for other Cr catalysts. This gure shows a gradual decrease of the intensity of the 360 nm band with increasing time on-stream.
It is also clear that almost all Cr6 was reduced to Cr3 after 10 min on-stream. Indeed, the amount of Cr3 formed upon the reduction of Cr6 gradually increased with reaction time,and reached a maximum after 1020 min on-stream. It is also important to notice that there was still a small increase in the absorption intensities with reaction time after the reduction of surface Cr6 took place. This is most probably due to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, which is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst.By comparing the amount of Cr3 formed (upon the reduction of Cr6) in Cr/SA-0 catalysts diering in their Cr content, we noticed that the amount of Cr3 increased almost Fig. 4 In situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectra of a 0.2 wt.% Cr/SA-0 catalyst treated at 500 C in 18% n-butane in as a func-

linearly with increasing Cr loading up to 2 wt.% Cr (Fig. 6).
The deviation from linearity at higher Cr loadings must be due to the inherent limitations of the KubelkaMunk theory [eqn. (1)].15 Discussion The goal of this work was to address the role of Cr6, Cr3 and Cr2 in alkane dehydrogenation reactions by using in situ on-line GC analysis during UVVIS DRS spectroscopy. First of all, it is important to stress that, although the conversions obtained in the in situ cell are always low, substantial dier- ences in catalytic performance were obtained between the dif- ferent Cr catalysts. This suggests that this method will be useful for characterizing other supported metal oxide catalysts in catalytic action. Furthermore, our experiments clearly show that Cr6 was instantly reduced to Cr3@2 after exposing the catalyst to a stream of n-butane. Thus, the initially low selec- tivity towards alkenes must be explained by the cracking and oxidation properties of high-valence chromium species. After 510 min on-stream, all Cr6 was reduced to Cr3@2, and the catalytic activity reached a maximum. The selectivity towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene, on the other hand, was ca. 90%, and similar values are obtained for catalysts Cr/Al2O3 in industrial practice.3,4 Another comment concerns the oxidation state of the active Cr species for alkane dehydrogenation, which has been the subject of debate and controversy for many years in the liter- ature.3 According to several authors the active species is Cr3,while other authors propose both Cr2 and Cr3, or solely Cr2 as the active dehydrogenation site.6h12 The almost linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, as measured by in situ DRS spectroscopy, indicates that Cr3 is the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation (Fig. 6). Further evi- dence comes from Fig. 2, which shows the relationship between the Cr2 : Cr3 ratio on the catalyst surface (as determined by DRS after CO reduction at 600 C5,17) and the Fig. 6 Amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction vs. conversion (%) for Cr/SA-0 catalysts diering in their Cr content

View Article Online catalytic activity. It is clear that the catalytic activity increases with decreasing Cr2 : Cr3 ratio. However, it is also clear that our experiments do not allow us to rule out the possible activity of Cr2 sites. Indeed, an alternative explanation could be that Cr3 species are more active than Cr2 species. In addition, the dd absorption band is always very broad, and dierent Cr2@3 species may be involved in catalysis.
Further evidence for the signicance of Cr3 species (formed upon Cr6 reduction) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions can be found in the literature.6,10,12 Masson et al.12 and Hakuli et al.6 found that high-valence chromium species were the precursors of the active Cr3 sites of the catalyst because (1) the amount of Cr6 decreased in parallel with the initial activity, and (2) Cr3 was the only species detected by XPS measurements in a reduced catalyst. In addi- Cr/Al2O3 tion, De Rossi et al.10 found that the dehydrogenation activity of and catalysts was due to coordinatively Cr/Al2O3 Cr/ZrO2 unsaturated Cr3 sites. In view of this work, it is important to underline that our analysis (1) is not able to give a more detailed picture of the coordination geometry and poly- merization degree of the active Cr3 site, and (2) does not exclude the possibility that the active Cr3 species could also arise from reduction of Cr5. Indeed, De Rossi et al.10 have concluded from EPR measurements that Cr5-species are the precursors of the active Cr3 species, and in situ EPR mea- surements are under way in our laboratory to substantiate this point.
Conclusions The following conclusions can be made.
(1) In situ on-line GC analysis during UVVIS DRS spec- troscopy is a useful technique for studying supported metal oxide catalysts in catalytic action.
(2) The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increased with increasing Cr content, and content of the support, and a maximal conversion was Al2O3 reached after 515 min on-stream. The selectivity towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene was ca. 90%, and deactivation of the catalysts was due to coke formation.
(3) The initial reduction of Cr6 after exposing the catalyst to n-butane was responsible for the formation of and
CO/CO2
cracking products and
(C1 , C2

(4) The dehydrogenation activity was proportional to the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction. Although the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2 species cannot be ruled out,it seems that Cr3 was more active than Cr2.
