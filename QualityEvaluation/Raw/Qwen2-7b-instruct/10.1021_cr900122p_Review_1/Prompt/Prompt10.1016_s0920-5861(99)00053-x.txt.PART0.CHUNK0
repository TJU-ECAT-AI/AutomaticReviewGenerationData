Introduction The heterogeneous catalytic oxidation on oxides is extensively used in catalysis for selective and total oxidation processes. However, the cost and availabil- ity of feedstocks can seriously limit the process invol- ving olens because the raw materials constitute 60 70% of the costs of production. This creates a strong dependence on the raw materials market. Despite the large reserves of alkanes from natural gas or as liqueed petroleum gas (LPG), except for the conver- sion of butane to maleic anhydride on VPO catalysts [1], no industrial process appears to be operative for the conversion of alkanes. The activation of alkanes is more difcult than that of the corresponding olens,but their large reserves underline the economic inter- est in their conversion. The use of olens and olen- derived products is steadily increasing and their pro- duction is mainly based on steam cracking and FCC processes, which are energy intensive. At the same time, the reserves of raw material for these processes are becoming more and more limited. Consequently,more abundant and economic sources for the produc- tion of olens must be sought. The reactivity of feedstocks determines their ease of conversion. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial pro- cesses. Despite this, the increasing costs of traditional feedstocks currently demands advances in the conver- sion of parafns.

to aromatics, to olens or to organic molecules con- taining oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. Ethane is the second major com- ponent of natural gas, which makes it a potential source of chemicals such as light olens, oxygenates and aromatic hydrocarbons [2]. The oxidation of lower alkanes is a key issue in the use of natural gas and volatile petroleum fractions as new feed- stocks. The oxidation of ethane has been reported to yield ethylene, aromatics and acetaldehyde or acetic acid. Ethylene is mainly used for the production of low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density PE, ethy- lene dichloride, ethylene oxide, linear LDPE and ethylbenzene, among other compounds. The aroma- tization of ethane could extend the sources of aro- matics and should offer an alternative route for the separation of ethane from methane during the oxida- tive coupling process OCM since its recovery is hard to accomplish [3,4]. The production of aromatics is important owing to their use as a source of petro- chemicals and also due to their high octane number.
Acetaldehyde has been used for the production of acetic acid, but this process has now been replaced by Monsanto carbonylation of methanol. Acetic acid is mainly used for the production of vinyl acetate,acetic anhydride and solvent esters. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydro- carbons would provide an attractive alternative. In turn, the processes of combustion eliminate toxic compounds.
Catalysis by oxides is extensively used. The pre- sence of a support is of economic interest and such supports provide new means to tailor catalytic perfor- mance by altering the exposure of the sites and modifying their nature by interaction with the support.
This review addresses the results reported on the conversion of ethane (partial oxidation, aromatization and combustion) on supported oxides, assessing the relevance of the catalyst formulation (support, active phase, additive), the interaction with the support (spe- cic support and coverage) and the reaction conditions (type of oxidant, gas-phase additives) in a search for a molecular understanding of the structure of the active site and its activity. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implica- tions in catalytic performance are discussed, under- lining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. A further aim of this review to present new concepts as regards conversion of ethane since some of the most attractive results have come from alternative means of activating ethane.
1.1.
Nature of supported oxides Supported oxides consist of an oxide deposited on the surface of another oxide (support). The supported oxide (M) binds to the support (S) via bridging MOS bonds, which are formed in part by reaction with surface hydroxyl groups [5,6]. For instance, surface vanadia species present a terminal V=O bond and three bridging oxygen to the support, or surface molybdena species present a terminal Mo=O bond and four bridging oxygens to the support [7,8]. Similar structures are observed for other supported oxides [9].
Such structures are affected by ambient humidity,which hydrolyzes the MOS bond, resulting in an aqueous solution of the supported oxide. The chem- istry of these species has been studied by several authors [1013], although this is not present under ethane oxidation conditions, typically run above 573 K, where the catalyst remains essentially dehy- drated. Some changes in the dehydrated structure may occur during the reaction of ethane, however, the structure is related to the dehydrated one [14], as in the case of other alkane oxidation reactions [1517].
Dehydrated supported oxide species are present as surface isolated or bidimensional polymeric species,and aggregate as crystals above the monolayer cover- age. The dehydrated surface dispersed species are stabilized by their interaction with the surface groups of the support (hydroxyls), and the surface population of hydroxyl sites determines the monolayer coverage of the supported oxide. We consider the monolayer coverage as the maximum loading at which the sup- ported oxide is deposited as a surface species, free of tridimensional aggregates. Pure geometric considera- tion fail to provide correct estimations of the mono- layer coverage since the chemical stabilization of the surface species is not considered. For instance, a silica (Cabot, 337 m2/g) with a much higher surface area than an alumina (Engelhard, 222 m2/g) reaches mono- layer coverage at 12% V2O5 (ca. 2 V atoms/nm2),whereas a loading of 25% V2O5 is required on this alumina to reach a monolayer coverage (ca. 13 V atoms/nm2). For most oxides, surface monolayer 320
M.A. Ban
ares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319348 coverage is 510 times higher than for silica [18,19].
As the loading increases, the interaction among the supported metal oxide species (M) increases, thus resulting in surface polymeric species, characterized by the formation of MOM bonds. Silica support presents such a weak interaction with the supported species, that only surface isolated or crystalline supported oxide species are observed. At the loading at which interactions among the surface isolated species appear the silica alone is unable to stabilize surface polymeric species and they aggregate into tridimensional crystals.
The importance of compounds resulting from the interaction of supported oxides with the support, like silicomolybdic acid on silica-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts can be excluded for ethane oxidation.
Those species are not stable above ca. 570 K, breaking into surface molybdenum oxide species, as reported by several authors using different techniques [11,12,20,21] and no relevance is, thus, expected from silicomolybdic acid species for ethane oxidation, since the reaction is run well above 570 K. By contrast, the presence of additives affects the supported oxide.
Alkaline additives and impurities (Ca, Na, K, etc.) tend to coordinate to acidic supported oxides (V, Mo, W, etc.) by altering the MO bonds [2225]. Acidic additives affect the structure of the supported species since the support sites must be shared with a second component, resulting in an effective increase in sur- face coverage [26,27]. The interaction with P, for supported vanadium oxide species may result in VOPO4 if V is added prior to P; otherwise P coordi- nates strongly on the support. However, if silica is the support, its weak interaction with any supported spe- cies will allow the formation of VOPO4 and of alkali vanadates irrespective of the preparation procedure [23,2831], thus removing surface oxide species [17,25,2932].
1.2.
Activation of the hydrocarbon and selectivity The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity [33,34]. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure.
The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea- vage should be the rst step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The stronger the CH bond is the stronger the activation must be, and the dependence of the optimal reaction temperature for selective oxida- tion on the binding energy of the CH bond follows quite a linear trend for the lower alkanes [35]. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons (Table 1), CH bonds on secondary and tertiary car- bons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. However, all the carbons in ethane are primary, which makes it much less reactive than its larger homologues. The high disso- ciation energy of the CH bond of ethane vs. that of other bonds in other molecules will affect the max- imum selectivity attainable. By an extensive evalua- tion of activity data reported for several oxidation processes, Batiot and Hodnett have observed a corre- lation of the selectivity with the differences between the dissociation enthalpy of the weakest CH bond (D0HCH) in the reactant hydrocarbon and that of the weakest CC or CH bond of the product. Very high selectivity is observed if the difference is less than 30 kJ/mol, while it is minimal above 70 kJ/mol. A linear trend is observed for intermediate values, i.e., as the stability of the product vs. that of the reactant decreases [36].
Table 2 shows the dissociation enthalpy of the weakest CH and CC bonds in the products ethylene and acetaldehyde, together their difference with the weakest CH bond of ethane (D0HCH420 kJ/mol).
According to the data reviewed by Batiot and Hodnett, the conversion of ethane to ethylene is expected to be highly selective,with yields close to 50% (and some reports close to 60%). Burch [37] has also highlighted the lower reactivity of ethylene as compared to ethane for catalytic conversion. Conversely, the selectivity for Table 1 Dissociation energy of CH bond and charge on H of some light hydrocarbons Hydrocarbon Weakest CH bond CH bond Edisoc (kJ/mol) Atomic charge on H Methane Primary 440

So, the rela- tive reactivity of the reactant and the product deter- mines the limiting selectivity under conventional reaction conditions. The formulation of the catalysts will affect their interaction with the reactant and the products. The activity of the hydrocarbons (both reactant and product), the activation of the oxidant,and the reactivity of lattice oxygen will determine how close the performance of catalyst is to optimal selec- tivity under conventional reaction conditions. Conse- quently, the maximum selectivity appears to be determined by the reaction, rather than by the catalyst.
The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The acidbase interaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide promotes the approach of the former to the active site [33,38]. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. Conversely, low valent cations result in a more electron-rich oxygen species, thus being more basic. The charges on the most reactive hydrogen atom of the hydrocarbons shown in Table 1 were calculated by Busca et al. [38]. Most of the alkanes have a negative charge on the most reactive hydrogen, which favors the interaction with electrophilic surfaces (acidic oxides). However, ethane and methane do not have a negative charge on the most reactive hydrogen, thus altering the nature of the interaction of these alkanes with the surface of the oxide as compared with larger hydrocarbons [3844]. Methane clearly displays a positive charge on its H atoms and its activation is most effective on basic oxides. A certain correlation has been reported between the strength of basic sites on the oxide surface and the isotopic exchange reaction of methane with deuter- ium, Ga2O3 being the most reactive of the series of oxides tested by several orders of magnitude, and the ZnO being the second most reactive [45]. However,the rate of conversion of methane does not completely correlate with HD exchange [46]. Ethane has a moderately positive charge in its H atoms, and prob- ably, some stronger afnity may be expected with basic oxides than with acid ones, but no conclusive trend has been reported in this line. Larger hydro- carbons have a negative charge and should show stronger interaction with acidic catalysts [3844].
The afnity between the hydrocarbon and the sur- face promotes the activation of the molecules. Selec- tivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. A strong acidbase interaction with the support may also pro- mote further degradation of partial oxidation products.
Thus, higher hydrocarbons require basic sites to pro- mote selectivity to olens [33] such as for butane [22,47]. The appropriate use of alkaline additives increases selectivity at a given conversion. Concep- cio n et al. [39] have shown that the selectivity to olens in a series of catalysts depends on their basic character and on the specic hydrocarbon. N-butane increases its selectivity in the order MgVAPO-5<VOx/ Al2O3<VAPO-5<VOx/MgOAl2O3<VOx/MgO; cor- responding to a decrease in relative acidity, as deter- mined by pyridine adsorption. This trend is reversed for ethane, while propane shows no specic trend at all [44]. In a different series (alkali-doped V2O5/TiO2),the conversion in propane dehydrogenation decreases,but the yield to propene increases, due to a decrease in the heat of adsorption of propane [48]. The importance of the strength of acid sites has been reported since moderately acid sites promote the selective ODH of ethane, whereas strong acid sites promote non-selec- tive COx species [18,4951]. The performance of the catalyst is also affected by the acidbase character- istics of the hydrocarbon vs. that of the catalyst. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance,because it determines how fast the surface intermedi- Table 2 Dissociation enthalpy of the weakest CH and CC bond of ethene and acetaldehyde Product D0HCH (KJ/mol) D0HCc (KJ/mol) Lowest difference vs. Ethane D0HCH (kJ/mol) Expected selectivity Ethylene 444 720 24 High Acetaldehyde 359 349 70 Low 322

By contrast, non-reducible oxides are much less reactive and require high reaction temperatures. These high reaction temperatures result in a signicant contribution of the gas-phase radical reaction [37,54] and this is reported to promote ODH products during ethane oxidation [33,43].
1.3.
Activation of the oxidant and selectivity The oxidation of ethane involves activation of the organic molecule and of the oxidant. Activation of the oxidant depends on its nature. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation [52]. In addition, the non-reducible catalysts operate at higher temperatures, which promotes the gas-phase activation of O2 and C2H6 [37,54,55]. Molecular oxygen activation on reducible oxides has been esti- mated from the exchange of 18O2=16O2 isotopes [45],which indicates the relative activation of oxygen on the surface of the oxides. This information offers a useful criterion for designing new catalysts [45]. The amount of defects in oxides, which is affected by the preparation method, strongly affects isotopic oxygen exchange [52,5658] and this affects reactivity [56].
Since the present focus is on supported oxides, the properties of surface oxygen species are less sensitive to preparation procedures and the oxygen exchange properties are essentially affected by the surface cov- erage and surfaceoxide interaction determine their properties. Chang et al. [59] have correlated the single-step double exchange between gas-phase 18O2 and lattice 16O to form 16O2 with the activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene on zeolite-exchanged and supported transition metal oxi- des. Both of them follow the trend: CoHZSM-5 >CuNaZSM-5>VZSM-5>NbZSM-5>NaZSM-5 HZSM-5CuZSM-5.
The formation of surface diatomic oxygen species can be observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy at moderate reaction tempera- ture, but the band assignment is not conclusive [60]. In any case, these bands are not present at reaction conditions, thus suggesting that monoatomic surface oxygen species along with lattice oxygen may be involved in the conversion of ethane [60].
The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduc- tion with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Some reports show that the most selective catalysts are less redu- cible although sometimes this trend is reversed. How- ever, catalyst reducibility is often determined by bulk reduction, which may differ from that of the surface sites. Since catalysis is a surface phenomenon, the data on catalytic performance should be correlated with the parameters of surface reduction rather than with those of bulk reduction. An interesting work by Valenzuela et al. [61] pointed out the relevance of surface reduc- tion for ethane ODH. The activity corresponds to the surface reducibility determined by in situ XPS mea- surements, but not with bulk reducibility, determined by TPR. This observation is of key importance in understanding the performance of bulk oxide cata- lysts, but should also be considered for supported metal oxide catalysts above monolayer coverage. In addition to the relevance of surface vs. bulk reduci- bility, it should also be noted that under reaction conditions, the hydrocarbon and not molecular hydro- gen is the reducing agent. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagree- ments found when connecting the activity and redu- cibility of the catalysts.
The selectivity and reducibility do not appear to show a clear trend. Even when a direct correlation if often observed between reducibility of supported vanadium oxide species and their activity, the oxidation state of the vanadium sites under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility as observed by in situ Raman and Vis UV spectroscopy under ethane oxidation conditions [14]. The average oxidation state of the vanadium site under reaction conditions, reects the balance in the catalytic cycle of oxidation and reduction of the sites,and this will signicantly affect the interaction with the hydrocarbon since the redox and acidbase proper- ties are affected by the oxidation state. Since the oxidation state under oxidation conditions does not correlate with the reducibility, it must account for the lack of relation found between reducibility and selec- tivity. In situ studies are required to fully understand the factors affecting the selectivity.
The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2- oxygenates [31,6266]. This appears to be due to the
M.A. Ban
ares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319348 323 strong activity of O species with alkanes at lower temperatures than under molecular oxygen. Ward et al. [63] observed the genesis of O species from N2O but not from molecular oxygen upon interaction with the catalyst surface according to EPR spectro- scopy. They detected no radical alkyl species, which suggests that radical species must readily transform into diamagnetic species [63]. Modeling by Sinev et al. [67] of the ethane-to-ethylene reaction requires activation of the alkane by cleavage of a CH bond by surface-oxygen active species and a fast capture of ethyl radicals by surface oxygen active sites; this would account for the observations by Ward et al.
[63]. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions [52]. The reaction of O gen- erated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR [68]. The interaction of N2O with the catalyst is different to O2 since nitrous oxide does not fully reoxidize the catalyst under reaction conditions [31,69] and the activation energy is different when oxygen or nitrous oxide are used as oxidants for ODH of ethane [70]. Additionally, the reaction in the pre- sence of N2O appears to be less affected by the modication of the redox properties of the catalyst.
Supported-oxides, undoped and doped with K, afford similar conversions of ethane under N2O. Conversely,the activity decreases remarkably upon the addition of K if the reaction in run under O2 [22,31,71], as expected from the relevance of reducible sites for the activation of molecular oxygen. Comparison of both oxidants is hard since N2O requires lower opera- tion temperatures than O2. At low temperature, N2O has been reported to be more active than molecular oxygen for the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde on vanadium oxide catalysts, whereas the situation is reversed at higher temperatures [72,73].Reductive activation of the oxidant (oxygen or nitrous oxide) with hydrogen signicantly increases the conversion of ethane and decreases the reaction temperature to the 573773 K range. While the dehy- drogenation predominates when oxygen is used as oxidant, the use of nitrous oxide, or the addition of hydrogen with any of the oxidants shift the product distribution to the oxygenates ethanol, ethanal and formaldehyde [66].
The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen spe- cies is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation [52,53,74]. However,combustion of ethane has been observed in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, the oxide being the only source of oxygen [53] since the mobility of oxygen in the oxide is an additional factor determining selectivity [52]. Factors governing the activation and stability of the hydrocarbon and intermediates also affect the activity and selectivity of the process.
1.4.
Experimental conditions The temperature at which ethane ODH is run under molecular oxygen may promote gas-phase conversion of ethane, since this becomes signicant above 923 K [37,44,55,57,7581]. The participation of gas-phase reaction should be prevented to avoid additional sources of reactivity. This would confuse the evalua- tion of catalytic performance. The relevance of the gas-phase conversion is directly related to the amount of void volume present in the reactor [55,78]. As the surface-to-volume ratio of the reactor increases, the relevance of gas-phase conversion of ethane is mini- mized since radicals are terminated by collision with the walls of the reactor or by adding inert packing to the reactor that will scavenge the radicals. On the other hand, the interaction with the walls of the reactor may also provide further activation of ethane if the reactor contains trace amounts of the catalyst. Consequently,the contaminated walls themselves would act as a catalyst, thus altering the catalytic evaluation [57].
The presence of water in the reaction feed, decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen containing species [82].
The reaction under N2O occurs at lower tempera- tures than under O2, which would prevent the parti- cipation of gas-phase reactivity. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity.
The presence of 25 Torr of water on silica-supported molybdena catalysts under N2O decreases conversion by 80% at 550 K while lower amounts of water have no appreciable effect [63]. The presence of water promotes the ODH of ethane in the gas-phase at 860 K under O2. At moderate reaction temperatures,partial solvating of surface vanadium oxide species,that would affect the catalytic properties, has been observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy [83]. How- ever, such hydration is not observed for silica-sup- 324
M.A. Ban
ares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319348 ported catalysts, due to the hydrophobic character of silica, and no modication in the structure of surface molybdenum oxide species is expected. However, the presence of large amounts of water must affect some- how the activation of N2O into O species [63], since O species are not observed by EPR on water-exposed silica-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts under N2O at 363 K [84]. However, 363 K is a rather low temperature, and some surface hydration is expected [83]. Hence, this experiment may not reect the reaction conditions. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation.

Ethane ODH and partial oxidation to oxygenates
2.1.
Vanadium oxide-based catalysts V-containing catalysts have been extensively used in a large number of catalytic processes involving selective oxidation reactions (such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, oxidation of o-xylene,1,3-butadiene,methanol,
CO,
ammoxidation of hydrocarbons, selective catalytic reduction of NO,and the partial oxidation of methane) [25,34,85,86].
The applicability of vanadium-based catalysts for ethane conversion are evident [8790]. This section will evaluate the relevance of several parameters on the performance of supported vanadium oxide species.
2.1.1.
On the active oxygen site Like other reactions, the terminal metaloxygen double bond has been proposed to be the active site for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [91,92], how- ever, INDO calculations by Haber et al. [93] suggest that the interaction of a hydrocarbon molecule is most favorable with a bridging oxygen than with a terminal one for vanadium oxide clusters. When the relevance of the terminal V=O bond for ethane oxidation on supported vanadium oxide catalysts at monolayer coverage on several supports is evaluated by in situ Raman spectroscopy, it turns out that the V=O bond does not correlate with the changes of activity of the catalysts, which are of one order of magnitude [18].
Similar results have been reported by Wachs and co- workers for butane oxidation [15] and methanol oxi- dation [94]. This would indicate that the terminal V=O bond does not appear to be involved in the catalytic oxidation of ethane. Furthermore, several experimen- tal evidences support the relevance of bridging oxy- gens for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Initially,studies on molybdenum oxide suggests that the oxy- gen involved in catalytic selective oxidation is the bridging one [95]. Combined Raman and isotopic labeling on b-VOPO4 suggests that the VOP oxygen is involved in the selective dehydrogenation of C4 hydrocarbons, while the contribution from the term- inal V=O bond to this selective process appears to be very reduced [96]. The same methodology allowed Glaeser et al. [97] to show that the bridging BiOMo in bismuth molybdate participates in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. The contribution by Chaar et al. [98] on magnesiasupported vanadia with high selectivity for butane dehydrogenation evidence the absence of terminal V=O bonds by IR spectroscopy. It therefore appears that the terminal oxygen is not critical for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.
In fact, an in situ isotopic Raman study with 18O2 by Wachs and coworkers [15] revealed that the terminal V18O bond is stable for nearly 20 times the char- acteristic reaction time. More recently, the same group has reported that, in different environments, vanadium has the same activity irrespective of the presence of the terminal V=O bond [99]. A very recent contribu- tion by Dang et al. [100] on the dehydrogenation of ethane on BaCO3supported vanadia has demon- strated the formation of Ba3(VO4)2, which is highly selective (76% selectivity of ethylene at 34% conver- sion at 923 K) and has no terminal V=O bonds. Thus,it is the bridging bond that must be invoked to account for this catalytic performance. All these results rule out the terminal V=O bond as the critical active site of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the oxidation of ethane.
2.1.2.
Support effect (VO-support bond) The oxygen species bridging surface vanadium oxide species to the support may play a signicant role in catalyst activity. A change in the support changes the VOS bond and the catalytic perfor- mance for ethane oxidation is affected by one order of magnitude in the sequence TiO2>ZrO2Al2O3> Nb2O5>CeO2SiO2 [18]. The change in support alters
M.A. Ban
ares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319348 325 the TOF number by four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation and two orders of magnitude for butane oxidation [15,94]. These results suggest that the bridging VOS bond would be directly involved in the reactivity of supported vanadium oxide species.
The evaluation of vanadium sites in different environ- ments by Wang et al. [99] underlines the relevance of the VOS bond for activity vs. the terminal V=O bond. The nature of the VOS bond appears to be critical for the oxidation of ethane. The activity order is close to the reducibility of surface vanadium oxide species on these supports, which correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the cation of the oxide support [14,101]. However, this trend follows as CeO2>ZrO2TiO2>Nb2O5>Al2O3>SiO2.
Ceria and niobia react with the supported vanadia, forming new compounds that remove surface vanadia species [14] thus decreasing their activity. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility, as observed by in situ Raman and VisUV spectroscopy [14]. The sta- bility of the supported vanadium oxide catalyst is an important factor. Reducibility of V on SnO and CeO2 is high but the activity is low. When tin oxide is used as a support for vanadium oxide it promotes its integra- tion into the rutile lattice of SnO as V4 [102]. A similar phenomenon takes place for titaniasupported vanadium oxide, which decreases its activity due to integration of V4 sites into the rutile phase of titania,along with the utilization of anatase phase [18,103 105]. It should be noted that the lower activity of rutilesupported vanadia is due to the integration of vanadium species into rutile lattice, as the activity of surface vanadium oxide species is not affected by the specic oxide support phase [106]. It has been shown that the structure (according to Raman spectroscopy and 51V-NMR) and reactivity of surface vanadia species for methanol oxidation is not affected for a series of titaniasupported vanadia on a series of titania supports possessing different phases (anatase,rutile, brookite and B) [106]. As commented above the low TOF numbers for V2O5/Nb2O5 and V2O5/CeO2 are due to a solid state reaction with the support [14].
The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vana- dium oxide catalysts has been explored by Le Bars et al. [51] and Wan and coworkers [50]. Activity decreases in the order V5ZSM-5>V5APO-5 >V5/AlPO4>V5/silicalite>V5/silica [50].
This trend corresponds to the number of acidic sites. All the catalysts show comparable selectivity of ethylene and CO. The higher activity of ZSM-5supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also related to the large amount of CO2 that may arise from over oxidation of partial oxidation products inside the microporous structure. The stronger acidity observed for P-contain- ing catalysts appears to be due to the POV bond,since XPS technique reveals a strong electron with- drawing effect on vanadium sites [50]. The higher activity of VAPO-4 catalyst is also related to the higher ease of reoxidation [50].
Both, acidbase and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. Lo pez-Nieto and coworkers [39,107] have reported the equilibrium required between reducibility and the acidbase character of the sites. These authors studied the activity of highly dispersed surface vanadium oxide species on alumina,magnesia, mixed magnesiaalumina, and vanadium oxide-containing microporous material. As in other reports [18,30,40,61,71,108], the activity under O2 runs parallel to the reducibility of the catalysts, which decreases thus: V2O5/Al2O3>VAPO-5>MgAVPO-5 V2O5/MgO>V2O5/MgOAl2O3.
However,the selectivity of olens depends on the acidity of the catalysts,which increases as V2O5/MgO<V2O5/ MgOAl2O3<VAPO-5<V2O5/Al2O3<MgVAPO-5,as determined by pyridine adsorption [39,107].Michalakos et al. [40] have observed the same trend for supported vanadia catalysts with Mg or P. It has also been reported that for vanadium oxide and mag- nesium oxide supported on APO-5 catalysts [109] the acidbase and redox function must be near the V sites.Modication of vanadium sites reducibility with Co on CoVAPO-5 further increases activity while ODH selectivity remains reasonably high [107]. The bene- cial effect of Co is also an expected result in view of the temperature-programmed isotopic exchange stu- dies by Chang et al. [49] on several ZSM-5-based catalysts. This conrms that also reducibility and acidbase properties determine the performance for
ODH. The former is related to the activation of the
hydrocarbon, but the ability to activate oxygen (iso- topic exchange) provides additional reactivity. 326

Surface vanadium oxide coverage effect (VOV bonds) Surface coverage alters the population ratio of (VOV)/(VO-support) bonds. This trend is not observed on silica-supported vanadia, where isolated surface vanadium oxide species are dominant up to monolayer coverage. VOV bonds appear to be involved in ethane oxidation, as observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy [14]. The same trend has been observed under butane oxidation [16]. Surface cover- age has a much lower effect than the nature of the support oxide. However, the environment of surface vanadium oxide species must affect the activity of the oxide catalysts, since neighboring surface vanadium oxide species promote the reducibility, thus increasing the activity. At very low surface coverage on alumina,the addition of vanadium decreases acidity, as the alumina sites are covered [110]. Above monolayer coverage, no further increase of acid sites is observed.
Activity increases with V loading on aluminasup- ported vanadia catalysts but the TOF number remains essentially constant [14,18,44,111]. Selectivity is affected by alumina coverage: at low vanadium cover- age, carbon dioxide is the main oxidation product,mainly due to the alumina sites. At higher V loading the alumina sites are titrated by surface vanadium oxide species and the selectivity increases reaching a yield of 21% for the 3.3% V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst. At very high V loading tridimensional bulk-like vanadia species are dominant. Their catalytic performance yields ODH products and non-selective COx species.
The surface coverage of vanadium on alumina modi- es the acidic and basic features of the catalyst [110,111]. The TOF number on silicasupported vana- dium is constant up to ca. 5% V2O5/SiO2 and decreases at higher loading due to the formation of vanadia crystals [14,111]. A similar trend has been observed for methane conversion to oxygenates [112] with vanadium loading on silica. In general, selectivity is affected by the coordination of vanadium oxide sites since the presence of VOV bonds with increasing coverage of vanadium decreases the selectivity to ethylene [18,39], it may be due to a larger number of active sites that may attack the hydrocarbon mole- cule. In fact, the site isolation proves to improve selectivity [33,34]. In this line, it is interesting to note that the best selectivities are reached on silicasup- ported oxides. It should be noted that no surface polymeric species are observed in silicasupported vanadia under dehydrated conditions, and only surface isolated vanadium oxide species are present up to monolayer coverage as measured by Raman and 51V-NMR spectroscopy [7,8] and by 51V-NMR and TPR measurements [113]. This is not the case on other supports like alumina. Oyama and Somorjai [114] have observed lower selectivity at low surface vana- dium loading on silica. At high surface coverage,ethylene is the main oxidation product whereas at low surface coverage CO2 is the main oxidation product. However, no characterization of these cata- lysts has been provided to explain why these vanadia silica catalysts show trends different from those of other silicasupported catalyst series. The formation of selective oxygen-containing products (mainly acet- aldehyde) is only observed at high vanadia surface coverage on silica by these authors [114].

Molybdenum oxide-based catalysts Silicasupported molybdenum oxide was tested for ethane oxidation with nitrous oxide by Ward et al.
[63]. EPR and XPS experiments showed that partially reduced Mo5 species are directly related to the active site. They proposed that c.u.s. Mo5 species would be the active site and that nitrous oxide would be acti- vated to O species, which readily react with ethane to yield ethylene at reaction temperatures below 573 K.
The absence of paramagnetic signals for surface ethyl radical rules out the presence of long-lived radical intermediates [63], in agreement with the foreseen rapid reaction of surface oxygen species [67]. If molecular oxygen is used instead of nitrous oxide,activity is very low and a certain activity is only seen at higher temperatures. By contrast, molybdenum oxide species are visibly oxidized, which is not the case under N2O. A completely oxidized MoO3/SiO2 cata- lyst is not active for the oxidation of ethane [115]. In fact, the activity of MoO3/SiO2 in O2 is comparable to that of pure silica [116]; thus, MoO3/SiO2 is not active for ethane oxidation in molecular oxygen at low temperatures. The presence of water vapor is essential for high selectivity to acetaldehyde. Surface molyb- denum coverage on silica is of crucial importance for the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. No sys- tematic study has been carried out yet on the effect of the support for supported molybdena, but the MoO-

It appears that surface molybdenum oxide species interacting with silica are active for acetaldehyde formation. At higher loading a tridimensional molybdenum oxide structure is expected to dominate. At this molybdena loading the selectivity is lower [39,42]. As for other oxides, the oxide used as a support affects the per- formance of the supported molybdenum oxide spe- cies, but to a lesser extent than in the case of vanadium oxide [101]. The very different trends with molecular oxygen or nitrous oxide as oxidants point to the existence of different mechanisms for each oxidant.
The reaction is of rst order with respect to N2O but zero order with respect to O2. As reported by several authors, N2O is more active than O2 at low tempera- ture, whereas at high reaction temperature this reac- tivity order is reversed [30,62,70,71].
2.3.
Alkaline and metal additives Alkali doping has afforded positive effects in many catalytic processes, like the synthesis in ammonia, the oxidation of SO2 to SO3, or the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzne to styrene, among others [117]. As regards supported metal oxides, alkaline additives tend to coordinate to acidic surface species (V, Mo,etc.), affecting the VO bonds [2225,118]. The pre- sence of alkaline additives has a benecial effect for the dehydrogenation of larger hydrocarbons due to a modication on the acidbase interaction of the hydrocarbon with the catalyst [37], but this trend reverses for ethane [44]. If silica is the support,compounds form readily with alkaline additives,due to the very weak interaction of silica with the supported species [17,25,2932]. The new compounds arising from this interaction show different perfor- mance due to new structural, acidbase and redox properties. Thus, Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs on silica supported vanadium oxide form the corresponding vanadates, as reported by Erdo helyi and Solymosi [31]. Except for KVO3/SiO2, all the catalysts undergo deactivation slowly during the oxidation of ethane with N2O. The deactivated catalyst can be regener- ated, except NaVO3/SiO2, by oxidation at 773 K.
NaVO3 is not stable above 720 K and decomposes.
The rest of the alkali-vanadate catalysts have higher stability than silicasupported vanadia catalysts and the formation of acetaldehyde and CO2 is consider- ably higher, while that of ethylene and CO decreases for the oxidation of ethane with oxygen [22]. The addition of K decreases the activity of aluminasup- ported vanadium oxide catalysts under O2 (Table 3) [22], contrary to the effects of alkaline additives observed by Solymosi [30,31] when N2O was used as oxidant.
The marked difference in performance of V2O5/ Al2O3 and V2O5/SiO2 catalysts upon addition of K must arise from the kind of oxidant used since it has been reported that nitrous oxide activation only requires single isolated sites [52], whereas the activa- tion of molecular oxygen may have further require- ments. The presence of alkaline additives of silica supported molybdenum oxide catalysts has a similar effect to that observed for vanadia-based catalysts [119]. Activity remains comparable when nitrous oxide is the oxidant, while it decreases remarkably when the oxidant is molecular oxygen. The presence of alkaline additives affects the redox properties of supported oxides (Mo or V) [17,22,30,71,119]. In the presence of oxygen, the reaction appears to involve redox cycles in the oxide catalysts. The addition of alkaline dopants decreases the extent of the redox properties of the supported oxide, thus decreasing the performance. The reaction in the presence of nitrous oxide does not appear to involve a redox cycle in the oxide and the interaction of N2O oxidant with the catalysts does not appear to be decreased by alkaline additives. However, for both oxidants the selectivity to COx products is higher than in alkali- free supported oxides. The larger production of COx products may be associated with the higher basicity of the catalyst, which should alter the interaction between the hydrocarbon and the catalyst surface [39].
Erdo helyi and Solymosi [29,119,120] evaluated the performance of alkali-molybdates supported on silica.
All the alkali molybdates showed similar reducibility,which was much lower than that of silicasupported bulk molybdena. The number of basic sites increases from Li to Cs molybdate. Silicasupported molybdena deactivates during the oxidation of ethane with nitrous oxide. The catalysts are reactivated by reoxidation.
Cs-, Rb-, and K-molybdates are active under the same conditions, but Na- and Li-molybdates show no 328

ares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319348 improvement. The yield to acetaldehyde increases with cation size, but decrease with time, like the yield of CO2. However, ethylene remains constant. The deactivation is due to an increasing reduction of the catalyst, which is regenerated upon reoxidation [29].
Again, water vapor favors acetaldehyde formation,especially for Rb2MoO4 (selectivity increases from 20% to 33%). The data presented by Erdo helyi and Solymosi suggest the relevance of acid sites for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and of basic sites for acet- aldehyde formation.
Comparison with ZnMoO4, MgMoO4 and MnMoO4 further evidences these trends [119].
The addition of acidic niobia has no effect on the structure of supported vanadium oxide species [25,121], it simply increases the surface density of vanadia sites [25]. This increases the amount of sur- face polymeric species, except for silica, where no surface polymeric species are observed [25]. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modies the redox properties and increases the acidic proper- ties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene [121]. This would suggest a benecial effect of acidic sites for the ethylene, but more results are required to fully substantiate this statement for the oxidation of ethane.

Phosphorus-containing catalysts

Catalysts containing V and P Merzouki et al. [122] evaluated the performance of VPO catalysts. If the P/Vatomic ratio is 1.15/1 activity is very low and acetic acid is the only product formed at low temperature. Increasing the oxygen-to-ethane ratio in the feed increases the acetic acid-to-ethylene selectivity ratio but has no effect on carbon dioxide formation. Doping the VPO catalysts with Te (Te/ V10%) decreases the selectivity of the catalyst.
Conversely, Pd-doped
VPO
(Pd/V0.151%) increases activity with Pd loading; acetic acid is already observed at 473 K and acetic anhydride at 573 K. However, the most remarkable feature of Pd- doped VPO catalysts is that, as conversion increases,ethylene becomes the main oxidation product with selectivity above 90% at ca. 12% conversion. The addition of Te yields a new structure of Te2V2O9 along with the (VO)2P2O7 phase, whereas Pd-doped VPO catalysts show no new compounds with Pd. However,only the very rst layers are directly involved in the reaction. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxida- tion state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te (Fig. 1). It has been proposed that the high afnity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene.
Tessier et al. observed that among bulk VPO cat- alysts (aVOPO4, (VO)2P2O7 and VO(PO3)2) only VO(PO3)2 appears to oxidize ethane to acetic acid.
Acetic acid selectivity is 100% up to 573 K, but activity is very low (<0.1%) and decreases rapidly over time [123]. Supporting this VPO catalyst on titania support prevents deactivation for atleast ve days on stream. Conversion is higher and acetic acid is observed at 473 K, but its selectivity decreases with conversion (temperature). High pressure (10 bar) increases the production of acetic acid.
