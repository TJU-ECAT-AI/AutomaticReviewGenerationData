Catalysis Letters 28 (1994) 1-7 1 Selective oxidation of butane on phosphorus-modified silica supported vanadia catalysts
W.D. Harding a, K.E. Birkeland b and H.H. Kung a,b,1
Departments of Chemical Engineering a and Chemistry b, Ipatieff Laboratory, Northwestern University, Evanston, 1L60208, USA Received 29 April 1994;accepted 14 June 1994 Triethylphosphate impregnation of 2.8 wt% V/Si02 and subsequent controlled calcination produced phosphorus-modified supported vanadium catalysts. Phosphorus modification enhanced the yield of maleic anhydride in the partial oxidation of butane. Varying the phos- phorus to vanadium atomic ratio from 0 to 2.8 increased the selectivity to maleie anhydride from 0 to approximately 48%. The selectivity was nearly constant up to 20% butane conversion and for different O2/C4H10 ratios. The Raman spectra of the phosphorus-modified samples had bands at 1040 and 930 cm -1, and broad unresolved bands between 580 and 540 cm -1. It was concluded that the active phases in these samples were a-VOPO4.

1. Introduction
Alkanes are attractive alternative feedstocks for chemical synthesis. Compared to their aromatic counterparts, alkanes are both relatively inexpensive and environ- mentally friendly. Unfortunately, few catalysts selectively oxidize alkanes. Some of the few successful examples in the literature include: dehydrogenation of alkanes on V-Mg oxide [1], oxidation of propane to acrolein on Bi-Ag-V-Mo oxide [2],and oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride on V-P oxide [3]. Of these examples,only V-P-O is used to functionalize an alkane commercially.
Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica [4-6], alumina [7,8], titania [4,7,9] or AIPO4 [10]. Research into supported materials has been driven by two factors: supports (1) improve mechanical strength and thermal stability of the catalyst, and (2) increase dispersion of the active phase and, therefore, exposure of active sites. Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhy- dride production compared to the unsupported catalysts.

W.D. Harding et al. / Selective oxidation of
butane added either silica or titania to a reaction mixture used to produce a-VOPO4 [4,11]. The restdting catalysts showed very poor selectivity in butane oxidation.
Zazhigalov et al. impregnated mixtures of VOC13/CC14 and POC13/CC14 onto silica to produce catalysts with different P : V ratios. They observed a maximum maleic anhydride selectivity of 23% at a P : V ratio of 2.9 [5]. Do and Baerns impregnated both alumina and titania with a mixture of vanadium oxalate and phosphoric acid to produce catalysts with P : V ratios of 0.78 and vanadium load- ings varying from 2.8 to 11.0 wt% [7]. The highest selectivities to maleic anhy- dride they obtained were 12 and 31% for 5.6 wt% V/AlzO3 and 2.8 wt% V/TiO2,respectively. In comparison, Kuo and Yang have reported selectivities as high as 54% for a 14 wt% VP1.6Ox/A1PO4 catalyst [10].
In the above mentioned studies the optimum P : V ratio for maleic anhydride production was found to be significantly greater than 1 : 1, although unsupported V-P-O catalysts traditionally have had an optimal P : V ratio close to unity. The highest selectivities reported for the unsupported samples were only about 50%,much lower than  70% for the unsupported ones. Unfortunately, these studies did not provide sufficient structural characterization of the active phase in the samples to understand these differences. We report here a study of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia in which the samples were characterized with Raman spectroscopy to understand the changes in the selectivities for maleic anhydride in the oxidation of butane.
2. Experimental
The 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 (equivalent to 5 wt%o
V205/SIO2)
was prepared with acid washed 35-60 mesh Davisil silica grade 646 using a procedure described previously [12]. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) analysis detected only low levels of metal impurities, which included less than 100 ppm of aluminum, titanium, and sodium, approximately 120 ppm of calcium and zirco- nium, and 200 ppm of iron. This sample is denoted PV0.0. Phosphorus was intro- duced to this sample as follows. Between 0.6 and 1.0 g of PV0.0 was calcined at 500 in vacuo and then under 1 arm 02 for 30-45 min in a pyrex tube equipped with a quick connect fitting containing an internal check valve. The tube was cooled to room temperature and transferred to a dry bag. The calcined sample had a Raman band characteristic of an isolated form of vanadia at 1040 em -1 [12-16].
An appropriate amount of triethylphosphate (TEP, Aldrich 99%) was dissolved in an amount of methanol (Fischer Scientific, 99.9%, anhydrous) equivalent to
1.05 ml/g (the pore volume of PV0.0) in an impregnation
vial and then transferred to the dry bag. The calcined PV0.0 was mixed with the TEP solution and shaken until the solid flowed freely.
The impregnated precursor was transferred to a reactor, and then heated to 80 at a rate of 1 under 20 ml/min of He to remove adsorbed methanol.
VK.D. Harding et al. / Selective oxidation of
butane 3 Subsequently, the sample was heated to 230 at a rate of 2 under 8 ml/ min of 02 and then rapidly to 425 to decompose any remaining organic species.
The catalysts were analyzed by ICP to determine the P : V ratios. Only a limited amount of phosphorus could be added in any one impregnation. Consequently,multiple impregnation--calcination cycles were required to produce catalysts with higher P : V ratios. The final compositions of the catalysts are shown in table 1.
Reaction studies were performed in a tubular, fused silica, flow microreactor with either an 88/8/4 or a 77/22/1 mixture of 2 mol% N2 in He (Linde, high purity grade)/O2 (Linde, extra dry grade)/C4H10 (Linde, CP grade). After the final TEP impregnation, the calcined catalysts typically were exposed to 25 to 200 ml/min of the reaction mixture and were heated to the desired reaction temperature. A ther- mocouple housed in a thermowell inserted into the catalyst bed monitored the bed temperature. Typically 0.2-0.7 g of catalyst were used. The products were ana- lyzed by on-line gas chromatography using columns described previously [12].
Raman spectra were collected using the 514.5 nm line of a Coherent INOVA 70-2 Ar ion laser at 25 mW power. The catalyst samples were pressed into wafers and mounted into a Raman cell. The cell was evacuated and heated at a rate of 15 to 500 whereupon 1 arm of 02 was introduced. The samples were cal- cined for 30-40 min, cooled to room temperature, and analyzed by Raman spectroscopy in the 02 atmosphere.

W.D. Harding et al. / Selective oxidation of
butane Between 140 and 200 acrylic acid and acetone/propanal accounted for > 15% of the organics, whereas above 200 acetic acid accounted for 35% of the observed organics. Ethene was also detected over this temperature range, as well as some uni- dentified higher molecular weight species. Subsequent TEP impregnations and cal- cinations produced similar distributions of organic decomposition compounds.
Only a limited amount of phosphorus was retained by the catalysts in any one impregnation. In a series of experiments, sufficient TEP to produce samples with P : V ratios of 0.6, 1.0, and 2.0 was impregnated onto PV0.0. In every case the cata- lysts after calcination had P : V ratios of approximately 0.6. Successive impregna- tions were required to produce catalysts with higher P : V ratios. Phosphorus was also added to unmodified acid washed silica. A single phosphorus impregnation produced a 1.23 wt% P/SiO2 catalyst. This would have corresponded to a P : V ratio of 0.72 had the 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 precursor been used. The catalyst was denoted P/SiO2.
P/SiO2 was white whereas the PV0.0 was light yellow deepening to reddish orange on exposure to moisture. The phosphorus-modified vanadium catalysts became increasingly bluish with increasing phosphorous content and their colors were unaffected by exposure to the atmosphere. The colors of the samples are listed in table 1.
All of the PV catalysts were catalytically active for the oxidation of butane,whereas P/SiO2 was not. Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly.
Table 2 shows the product distributions for each sample at two butane conversions for reactions at 425 with 88/8/4 mixtures of He/O2/C4. The product distributions at other conversions followed the trends shown in the table.

a MA = maleic anhydride; C30 = acetone/propionaldehyde; TDS = total dehydrogenation = sum of 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene; others = sum of acetic acid, acrylic acid, and propene.
W.D. Harding et al. / Selective oxidation of
butane 5 acrylic acid, and acetic acid were detected. All carbon balances were consistently satisfied within 2%.
At low conversions, PV0.0 produced primarily a mixture of 1-butene, trans-2- butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene but very little maleic anhydride [12]. At higher conversions, carbon oxides dominated. In comparison, all phosphorus- modified catalysts had higher selectivities for maleic anhydride. Although unsup- ported V-P-O has the greatest selectivity for maleic anhydride at a P : V ratio of approximately unity, the selectivity for maleic anhydride for the supported cata- lysts increased from 23 to 48% with a corresponding increase in the P : V ratio from
0.6 to about 2.8. Furthermore, the maleic anhydride selectivity
remained constant for butane conversions up to 20%, the highest conversion studied. Another sample of a P : V ratio of 3.2 was also prepared. It was much less active than the other PV samples, although its selectivity for maleic anhydride remained at approximately 48% for a butane conversion of 2%.
The effect of 02 : butane ratio in the feed was investigated with the PV2.8 sam- ple. Under steady state conditions, a more oxidizing reaction mixture of 77/22/1 He/O2/C4 produced slightly lower activity and maleic anhydride selectivity, being
36.8%, than if
the feed was an 88/8/4 He/O2/C4 mixture.
The activation energies for butane consumption on the phosphorus-modified catalysts also differed from that of PV0.0. They were calculated from data obtained between 400 and 450 at less than 8% butane conversion. The values were 115 4- 15, 97-4- 10, 97 • 18, 97 4- 12, and96 4- 13 kJ/mol for samples PV0.0, PV0.6,
PV1.4, PV2.2, and PV2.8, respectively. Thus, within experimental error, the phos-
phorus containing samples had the same activation energy that was lower than that of V/SiO2. The activities of the catalysts, expressed as moles of butane converted per mole of vanadium per minute, are shown in table 1. For most samples, the rates were within a factor of two.
The change in the catalytic properties of V/SiO2 upon phosphorus modification suggested interaction between phosphorus and vanadia. Unfortunately, useful X-ray patterns were not collected with these samples, indicating that any vana- dium phosphorus compounds formed were very small crystallites. However,changes in the samples could be observed with Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of the samples. Spectra of both silica and phosphorus-modified silica were featureless. The spectrum of a fresh sample of PV0.0 had a band at 1040 cm -1, characteristic of a tetrahedrally coordinated isolated vanadyl species [13-17]. After reaction, bands characteristic of crystalline VzO5 at 998, 706, 408,309, and 285 cm -1 appeared (fig. lb). This agglomeration of isolated vanadia under butane oxidation conditions has been observed on high loading vanadia sam- ples [12]. Both fresh and used samples of all of the PV catalysts retained the band at 1040 cm -1 . The spectra of samples PV1.4, PV2.2, and PV2.8 (figs. le, lf, and lg) had strong bands at about 1040 and 930 cm -1, a weak band at about 980 cm -1,and unresolved bands between 580 and 540 cm -1 . The spectra did not change after the samples were used in reaction. These spectra compared well with those of al- 6

Similarly Deo and Wachs have observed broad Raman bands at 1035 and 923 cm -1 for H3PO4 modified
0.56 wt%
V/TiO2 (P : V of 3.8) and have assigned them to I 1-vOpO4 [9].
Thus, treatment of 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 with triethylphosphate resulted in the for- mation of Ctl-VOPO4, which was hydrated to VOPO4.2H20 upon exposure to moisture. This is consistent with the catalytic results. It has been reported that over unsupported a-VOPO4, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride with a selectivity of about 50% [19], a value observed with samples PV2.4, PV2.8 and PV3.2. The for- mation of VOPO4 instead of (VO)2P207 was a result of the preparation proce- dure. After phosphorus impregnation, the samples were calcined in oxygen, which would oxidize the vanadium ions to the 5+ state. Phosphorus to vanadium ratios greater than the stoichiometric amount required to form VOPO4 were expected because, in the impregnation procedure, phosphorus could coordinate either to the vanadia or to the silica support. A phosphorus distribution across the catalyst could yield an overall P : V ratio greater than unity, but a local P : V ratio close to
W.D. Harding et aL / Selective oxidation of
butane 7 that of VOPO4. Therefore, the poor selectivity for maleic anhydride reported in the literature for supported V-P-O catalysts probably is because some of the vana- dium ions in those samples did not form vanadyl pyrophosphate or vanadyl phos- phate due to deposition of some of the phosphorus on the support.
In conclusion, phosphorus modification of vanadia supported on purified silica enhanced the selectivity of butane oxidation to maleic anhydride. It resulted in the formation of very small crystallites of VOPO4"H20 and I-VOPO4, the catalyt- ic properties of which were similar to the unsupported oxides. From these results,one would expect that if the samples were prepared in a reducing atmosphere, fine crystallites of supported (VO)zP207 could be produced with catalytic properties similar to the unsupported samples.
