The effects of the reaction temperature, the partial pressure of the reactants and the contact time have been investigated [20]. The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase. The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing [19-21]:(i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C;(ii) in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions,the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised;(iii) a definite concentration of propane was required for the reaction to proceed: it was stopped either when the total concentration of propane and oxygen was lowered to 60% (propane oxygen = 0.55; T = 500C) or when the ratio propane/oxygen was lowered to 0.14 (propane + oxygen= 91%; T= 500oc);(iv) appreciable amounts of homogeneous propane oxidation (mainly to propylene) occurred at 500C in absence of the catalyst. No acrolein was detected in these conditions;(v) an effect of the reactor volume and of its empty zone on the reaction performance was observed, with and without the catalyst. For example no reaction was observed when the reactor volume was small with and without catalyst.
These results seem to indicate that propylene was formed as primary product in the gas phase whereas acrolein was formed in the second step at the catalyst surface [20]. According to the authors [20], propyl radicals should be formed in the gas phase at high temperature in the pre-catalyst zone and then homoge- neously converted to propylene. These radical species were not considered as intermediates for acrolein formation since acrolein was not observed in the absence of the catalyst [20]. The source of acrolein remained propylene reacting over the metal oxide surface [20]. In Scheme 7 the possible mechanisms of 24

Path (a) and (b) represent the gas phase and the surface reactions for the propane ODHR step respectively. Path (a) is believed to be the preferred one in the case of BiMoO catalysts [19-21].
The observation of a homogeneous reaction in the pre-catalyst zone [20] is in good accordance with previous works showing that non-catalytic vapour phase oxidation of propane takes place in the range 350-500C [171,172]. However, it must be underlined that the bismuth molybdate of scheelite type here considered does not initiate surface radicals as intermediates of the formation of both propylene and acrolein. This behaviour is thus different from that of VMgO catalyst we discussed in the precedent section.
On the other hand, the observed selectivities, in fact, should partly reflect the ability of the considered scheelite type B-Mo-O catalysts to convert propylene to acrolein [20] and partly the degradation of acrolein under the chosen reaction temperature (500C). It is probably the reason why the multicomponent bismuth molybdate oxides, highly active catalysts for the oxidation of propylene to acrolein at 400C [61], were not suitable when tested in the propane to acrolein oxidation reaction at 500C [20].
From a practical point of view, two directions of improvement of the considered catalytic system emerge from the above results. The first one is the improvement of the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein in the overall process of partial oxidation of propane. In this sense, comparative studies of catalytic propane oxidation and propylene oxidation to acrolein should be of great interest and very useful. The second direction is the optimization of the reactor geometry in order to improve the first step of the considered reaction, i.e. the homoge- neous ODHR of propane to propylene.

4.2.2. Other catalytic systems
4.2.2.1. Combined propane ODHR and propylene oxidation catalysts. Earlier
works of Shatalova et al. [173] have shown that combining catalysts of propane ODHR (iron and magnesium oxides based catalysts) and catalysts of propylene oxidation to acrolein (molybdenum based mixed oxides catalysts) led to signifi- cant performances in selective oxidation of propane: 20% of acrolein selectivity for 10-30% propane conversion at 600C. No further improvements nor investi- gations have been reported up to now by the authors and no definite conclusion can be drawn from the obtained results: little is known about the accuracy of the products analysis [18].
4.2.2.2. Defect perovskite and rutile oxides. Conner et al. [22,174,175] have
tested defect perovskite and rutile Bi-Ba-Te-O, Fe-Nb-O, Fe-Ta-O oxides.The main partial oxidation products are aldehydes (acrolein, propanal, acetalde- hyde and formaldehyde) and methanol. Ethylene and methane are observed as cracking products but propylene is not detected. Total oxidation products are obviously formed, mainly carbon monoxide. The conversions and selectivities of the partial oxidation products depend on the reaction temperature for which two domains have been distinguished:at T < 440C the main products are acetaldehyde and methanol;at > 450C propanal and acrolein are mainly formed.
For both types of catalysts the selectivity of acrolein reached 20% at about 30% of propane conversion at 425C [22].
The reported results cannot be further discussed since no surface characteriza- tions have been published by the authors up to now. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note the presence of propanal and the absence of propylene in the reaction products [22].
Propanal formation should take place from propane either through the 1-pro- panol intermediate or through the allyl alcohol intermediate isomerisation (Scheme 2).
The 1-propoxy surface species is probably formed by a concerted mechanism (Scheme 8) by abstraction of a hydride anion on a Lewis acid/oxidizing site from a CH 3 group of propane and the nucleophilic attack of the carbon atom of this group by a lattice oxygen atom. This species should turn into propanal. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propanal to acrolein is facilitated by the exis- tence of the equilibrium formation of its enolate form in which a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the CH 2 group as proton on a basic site. The enolate species may then lead to acrolein by losing a hydride anion probably by a concerted mechanism also on a Lewis acid/oxidizing site.
The reaction steps of the allyl alcohol to propanal isomerization should be similar to those invoked in the case of the hydrogenation of a-j3 unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols on copper-chromite catalysts 26

This mechanism can be considered either as the isomerization of the adsorbed allylic alcohol to propanal or as the reduction of acrolein. Note that, through an SN mechanism [84], the direct isomerization of the cr-allyl to propanal by-passing the acrolein formation, should also be suggested:cr-allyl  enolate

[3M(r,-2)+OH- M(n-2)+O2- The absence of propylene in the reaction products is in favour of the former mechanisms rather than the latter, that is the direct formation of propanal from propane then acrolein from propane. However, very reactive surface propylene species cannot be excluded as reaction intermediates.It points out from the above results that defect oxides of perovskite or rutile type are relatively active in the partial oxidation of propane into aldehydes but lead to substantial oxidative breaking of the C-C bond as well as to products of total oxidation. An improvement of their catalytic performances may arise from a better comprehension of the observed activities.
4.2.2.3. Impregnated mixed oxides BMO and PMO. Various impregnated mixed
oxides BMO and PMO (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mg, A1) have been tested by Otsuka et al. [23] as catalysts in the partial oxidation of propane. These catalysts are mostly inactive except the B-P-O oxide which leads to significant performances. Thus, at 550C, the propane conversion is 22% and the selectivity of C3-O products (propanal, acetone, acrolein, acrylic acid) and propylene are 13% and 47%, respectively. Acetaldehyde (5%), ethylene (23%) and carbon oxides (10%) are also obtained.
It is noteworthy that propylene, propanal, acetone and ethylene stem directly from propane as shown by the study of their selectivities as a function of the contact time [23]. It is also shown, in the same reaction conditions as for propane, that propylene as reactant is not activated on the BPO oxide (conver- sion < 1%) and thus cannot be considered as an intermediate in the formation of the oxygenate products [23]. We may conclude that the reaction intermediates to oxygenate products, which necessarily involves an oxygenation step, should 28

Moreover, the 2-propyloxy species should also be the precursor of propylene as discussed above (see Section 4.1.Moritaka et al. [24] reported that the precipitated mixed oxides PMO (M = V, Cu, Ni, Mn, La, Co, Cr, Zr) are more active than the impregnated ones in the partial oxidation of propane. The main product formed is propylene: up to 25% (50%) of selectivity for 22% (3%) of propane conversion for M = V (Co) and the selectivity of oxygenates (acrolein, propanal, acetone, propanoic acid, acetic acid, acetaldehyde) may reach 40% (M = Cu, Ni, Mn). The selectivity of the cracking products is 7-10%. The detection of propanal and propanoic acid,which cannot be only derived from propylene, strengthens once again the existence of a direct path of production of oxygenate products from propane by-passing the propylene intermediate (Scheme 8).
4.2.2.4. ODHR of propane and propylene. At this level of the discussion it is of
interest to get back to the work of Volta et al. [138] on the ODHR of propane to propylene, and specially to the comparison between propane and propylene oxidation (Table 4). Three observations can be made.
First, the -MgzV20 7 phase favors mild oxidation either for the partial oxidation of propane (70.8% against 6.0-45.8% for the two other Mg phases) or for the partial oxidation of propylene (49.1% against 0-30% for the other two Mg phases). Acrolein was the major oxygenate product (71.3-72.7% of relative selectivity) for the o-MgzVzO 7 phase whereas acetaldehyde is the only oxy- genate product obtained (100% of relative selectivity) for the t-MgV206 phase.
No oxygenate at all but CO x (94% of selectivity) are produced over the Mg 3V208 phase.
The second point is that, whatever the reactant feed, propane or propylene, a striking quite equal distribution of oxygenate products was obtained over the
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
29 cx-Mg 2 VzO 7 phase. Indeed, the relative selectivities are quite identical: 72.7% (acrolein), 21.2% (propanal), 6.0% (acetic acid) and 0.0% (acetaldehyde) in the case of the propane reactant against 71.3%, 22.6%, 6.1% and 0.0% respectively in the case of the propylene reactant. The precedent equalities can be considered as not fortuitous but should indicate that the observed oxygenates produced in the partial oxidation of propane rather stem from propylene intermediate. This conclusion seems to be held in the case of the o-Mg2V206 phase which gave only acetaldehyde with the same 100% relative selectivity when starting either from propylene or from propane. In the same way, the Mg3V20 s phase gave strikingly almost CO x (94.0-100.0%) for the two reactants.
All these results are in agreement with a reaction mechanism where propylene is the precursor of the oxygenate products in the partial oxidation of propane over V-MgO catalyst (Scheme 2).
The third point is the obtaining of propanal with both propane and propylene reactants (Table 4). Propylene is expected to oxidize to acrolein through the allylic process and to acetone or acetic acid through the oxyhydration process (see Section 3). The lack of acetone formation seems to indicate that the presence of basic centers inhibits the hydration step (which needs BrSnsted acid-sites) at the benefit of the formation of propanal through the allyl species (see Section 4 and Scheme 9):

The former should be more reactive towards oxidation than hydration (k 1 >> k 2) than the latter. Indeed, preliminary results obtained in our laboratory have shown that, on supported VPO catalysts, 1-propanol is oxidized mainly to propanal (propylene is obtained as a minor product) whereas 2-propanol is oxidized mainly to propylene (acetone is obtained as minor product) [178].
The same reasoning and conclusions can be held for the results obtained for 30

the propane partial oxidation if we assume, as discussed above in the second point, that propylene is the intermediate species to oxygenate products.
It must be said that, obviously, the results of Table 4 need further investiga- tions (notably kinetics) in order to determine the reaction paths and to under- stand the formation of propanal in the selective oxidation of both propylene and propane over the VMgO catalysts.
4.2.3. Conclusions
The BiMoO mixed oxides of the scheelite type exhibit interesting catalytic performances but it must be noted that these catalysts do no really activate propane but propylene which is shown to be homogeneously produced in the gas phase as intermediate and then oxidized to acrolein on the catalyst surface. So the expected improvements of the BiMoO catalytic system mainly consist in the addition of promoters capable of increasing the oxidation step of propylene to acrolein. In parallel, the optimization of the geometry of the reactor should contribute to improve the homogeneous ODHR of propane to propylene, and,consequently, to improve the overall process.The defect mixed oxides of perovskite or rutile type (BaBiTeO, FeNbVO and FeTaO) and the BPO based mixed oxides were found active in the partial oxidation of propane (up to 25% of conversion), but less selective to acrolein (< 10%). However, they could be good candidates for further improvements since they produced, besides COx, mainly C1-C 3 aldehydes or C l-C2 alcohols (defect mixed oxides) and good selectivities (up to 65%) for partial oxidation products (propylene + oxygenates).It is worthwhile to note that the VMgO catalysts, specifically used for the ODHR of propane to propylene, also produced appreciable amounts of acrolein and propanal from propane (16-30% selectivity at 6-8% conversion). They should also be good candidates for the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein.
4.3. Formation of acrylonitrile
The above discussions show that a general aspect of propane oxidation is the low selectivity to products of partial oxidation, notably due to the too high rate of the consecutive oxidation of the products formed. A possible key factor to reduce this rate is to carry out the oxidation in presence of ammonia, forming the more stable product, acrylonitrile which, in addition, belongs to the basic chemicals [179,180]. These considerations, besides the lower price of propane as compared to the price of propylene [29,179], led to new and notable interest to the catalytic ammoxidation of propane [ 19-21,27-30,164,180-182].
The earliest catalytic systems reported for propane ammoxidation were those reported by G. Minow et al. [183,184] and Z. Osipova et al. [185,186] and consisted of V, Mo, Bi-Mo supported oxides and Ga-Sb mixed oxides. Low activities and selectivities to acrylonitrile were formed and the formation of

propylene as an intermediate was proposed with an important contribution of gas phase reactions in the mechanism of propane oxidation [183,184].
The most promising results concern the BiMo(V)O (Table 5) and VSbO systems (Table 6).
4.3.1. Bi-Mo(V)-O catalysts
The BiMo(V)O oxides of scheelite type structure are active and selective in the ammoxidation of propane as shown by the results reported by Moro-oka [21 ] (Table 5). The reaction was carried out at high partial pressure of propane. For example, the scheelite type complex Bi0.85Nbo.55Mo0.4504 gave more than 60% selectivity to acrylonitrile at about 20% conversion under 40% of propane in the feed gas at atmospheric pressure and 515C. The other products are propylene,acetonitrile and carbon oxides.
The most striking feature of the obtained performances is that they are similar to those obtained in the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein (Table 5),particularly in the case of the most active and selective catalysts: AgBiVMoO gave 63.5% of acrolein selectivity at 13.1% of propane conversion (500C) in absence of ammonia and 64.8% of acrylonitrile at 15.8% of conversion (515C) in presence of ammonia. As in the case of propane oxidation to acrolein [15-21], the selectivity to acrylonitrile increased markedly with increasing reaction temperature and propylene is formed in absence of catalyst, notably at high temperature [21]. These similar catalytic performances suggest similar reaction mechanisms, i.e. a homogeneous reaction step where propylene is formed, followed by a heterogeneous reaction where acrylonitrile (acrolein) is produced [21] (Scheme 7, path a). However, compared to propane oxidation results [ 19-21 ], in propane ammoxidation:(i) no sudden start of propane conversion was observed when the catalyst was present;(ii) the selectivity to propylene was apparently low in non-catalytic conditions as compared to catalytic conditions.
These effects are attributed to the presence of ammonia [21 ]. Ammonia seems either to inhibit the propylene gaseous formation or/and to promote its surface formation since conversions and selectivities to acrolein and acrylonitrile,respectively, are quite similar (Table 5). As, in addition, no dinitrogen formation 32
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
was observed, we may conclude that ammonia, as additive, only plays the role of a nucleophile by shifting the reaction equilibria to the consecutive oxidation of acrolein to acrylonitrile. In this way, ammonia seems to modify the acid-base and/or the nucleophilic surface properties of the considered catalysts but not their redox surface properties. To clarify this point, investigations on these surface are needed since studies on the effect of ammonia were not reported up to now for these catalysts.
4.3.2. VSbO catalysts
It was found that VSbO catalyst are effective for the ammoxidation of propane [18,27-30,181,182] and are promising for industrial use. Table 6 resumes the main reported formulations. It can be seen that a maximum of 40% selectivity to acrylonitrile was attained at about 80% conversion.
G. Centi et al. [27,30] studied the ammoxidation of propane on VSbO
catalysts prepared by coprecipitation of vanadium and antimony soluble salts in aqueous ammonia. Acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, propylene and carbon oxides were formed. High activity was found when vanadium was in excess and high selectivity to acrylonitrile when antimony was in excess. Better performances were also obtained when alumina was incorporated to the VSbO oxide due to the occurrence of specific structural effects [28]. For the VSb(A1)O system, the active phase for the propane ammoxidation was suggested to be the amorphous VSbOa/Sb204 system epitaxially intergrown with the A1SbO 4 rutile phase.
Further improvements were obtained by addition of W or Mo elements. On the other hand, the A1SbO 4 phase, promoted by the V eluent, was found as active as for the ODHR of propane to propylene [28]. The kinetic studies showed that acrylonitrile is formed both indirectly through propylene intermediate and directly from propane, the former path being the prevalent one (Scheme 10) Table 6 Metal mixed oxides catalysts used in the ammoxidation of propane Oxides Reaction Propane Selectivity to Ref. temperature conversion acrylonitrile (%) (%) (%) VSbSnCu 470

Scheme 10. Kinetic routes of propane oxidation over VSbO catalysts (from Ref. [28]).
[28]. When the ammonia concentration is increased in the feed gas, the propylene selectivity increased whereas the acrylonitrile selectivity passed through a maximum (Table 7).
Anderson et al. [192] investigated VSbO systems prepared by the slurry procedure with various V/Sb ratios. The fresh catalysts consisted of V205 and SbVO 4 phases when vanadia was in excess. In this case, high rate and selectivity to propylene were obtained at low conversion and were related to the formation of amorphous vanadia spread over the surface of SbVO 4 as suggested by XRD, Raman, IR and XPS experiments. The fresh catalysts consisted of SbVO 4 and ot-Sb204 phases when antimony was in excess. These phases were the most selective to acrylonitrile due probably to their ability to transform intermediate propylene, as suggested by Raman and IR studies: these phases in interaction are more efficiently reoxidized than SbVO 4 alone during propane ammoxidation [192]. This behaviour was linked to the formation of suprasurface antimony sites on SbVO 4 resulting from antimony migration from the e-SbO 4 phase during the reaction course, in good accordance with XPS studies [192].
Kinetic results indicated that propane adsorption is the rate limiting step for propylene formation and that acrylonitrile and carbon oxides were produced from the intermediate propylene. Acrylonitrile and acetonitrile formations passed through a maximum when the ammonia pressure was increased due to the competitive adsorption between the propane reactant and ammonia [193-195].
As to carbon oxides formation, it decreased with the partial pressure of ammonia; this was explained by a competitive adsorption of ammonia and oxygen [192] leading to a decrease of the concentration of surface degradation Table 7 Effect of NH 3 on the partial oxidation of propane on VSbO catalysts at 500C (from Ref.

oxygen species [194,195]. The effect of ammonia partial pressure observed on the VSbO catalysts prepared by the slurry method was similar to that observed on the VSbO catalyst prepared by coprecipitation [27,28].
Addition of water vapour led to an increase of the rate and selectivity for acrylonitrile formation. We think that this result should be associated to a competitive route of acrylonitrile formation through the oxyhydration of acrolein to acrylic acid or/and to a better desorption of adsorbed acrylonitrile in presence of an excess of water:02

The obtained results were similar to those observed in the case of VSbAI(W) catalysts prepared by coprecipitation (Scheme 10) [28]. Indeed, the A1SbO 4 rutile phase was found to be formed, probably by epitaxial intergrown or as solid solution component with the VSbO4/ot-Sb204 system. Both V and Sb were reduced during the reaction and the reduced state was stabilized by the A1SbO 4 rutile-type phase. This phase also limits the presence of unselective vanadium species responsible of NH 3 oxidation to N 2. Acrylonitrile was shown to be formed by two parallel pathways: directly from propane ammoxidation and dominantly through the intermediate propylene ammoxidation. The allylic oxida- tion step of propylene to acrylonitrile competed with the high rate of propylene oxidation to carbon oxides. Acrylonitrile was found to be more stable than propylene to consecutive oxidation to carbon oxides. The propylene to acryloni- trile reaction is also limited by NH 3 oxidation to N 2 which decreases the surface availability of NH 3.
4.3.3. Conclusions
Promising results have been obtained in the ammoxidation of propane over BiMo(V)O and VSbO based mixed oxides. Propylene, the main reaction inter- mediate to acrylonitrile, seems to be produced in the gas phase in the case of the BiMo(V)O catalysts and on the catalyst surface in the case of the VSbO based mixed oxides. The investigations on the VSb(A1)O catalysts show that the active phase should be the amorphous VSbO4/Sb204 system in interaction with the A1SbO 4 rutile phase, vanadium and antimony ions being reduced during the reaction course.
Ammonia plays a more complex role (nucleo- philic/reducing/base agent) in the ammoxidation of propane over the VSbO system than over the BiMo(V)O system.

4.4. Formation of acrylic acid
4.4.1. Propane oxidation over VPO catalysts
Propane oxidation to acrylic acid on VPO based catalysts has been studied by Ai [26] at 350-400C in large excess of oxygen (oxygen/propane = 32.50) and of water (water/propane = 16.25). The main products were acrylic acid, acetic acid and carbon oxides. The yield of acrylic acid was 7% at 60% of propane conversion. Excess of phosphorus with respect to P/V = 1.00 composition induced a large decrease in both the activity and selectivity to both acids. The reaction was promoted by TeO 2 addition to the VPO oxide [25]. Incorporation of acidic compounds such as H3PW12040 , Sb20 3 and Nb205 increased the activity but decreased the yields of both acrylic and acetic acid [26]. The incorporation of H3PMo12040 to a VPO catalyst (P/V = 1,00) greatly enhanced the formation of acetic acid at the expense of the formation of acrylic acid. High content of water also enhanced the acids formation [25]. Propylene is proposed as the main precursor of both acrylic and acetic acids [25].
4.4.2. Propane oxidation over cesium catalysts
The propane oxidation to acrylic acid was also studied by Mizuno et al. [197] over Cs2.sHo.sPMolzO40 modified either by exchanging the acidic proton by several counter ions (Fe 3+, Ni 2, Co 2, Cu 2+, Mn 2) or by substituting the coordination ion Mo 6+ by V 5+ ions. The reaction conditions were: T= 300- 400C and C3H8/Oz/N2 = 30/40/30. The reaction products were: acrylic acid, acetic acid, acrolein, propylene and carbon oxides. Fe 3+ or Ni 2+ substitu- tion for H +, and V 5+ substitution for Mo 6+ in Cs2.sH05Mo12040 greatly enhanced the catalytic activity for direct oxidation of propane into acrylic acid.
The best performance (13 % yield of acrylic acid at 48% of propane conversion) was observed with Cs 2.5 Fe0.08 H 1.26VMo 11040 .
5. General remarks
5.1. Propane versus propylene selective oxidation
(1) The main remark about the results reported above is that the catalytic formulations used for propane selective oxidation are very different from the catalytic formulation used in the selective oxidation of propylene. Particularly,the former generally contains vanadia phases but not the latter. The main reason,as recalled in the introduction part, is the lesser reactivity of propane as compared to propylene reactivity: propane activation needs a higher reaction temperature (500C against 400C for propylene) and, as a consequence, strong activating phases such as vanadia. The difference of reactivity between propane and propylene is linked to the strengths of the involved C-H bonds and to the stability of the corresponding radicals formed in the rate determining step by H abstraction: the less stable propyl radical (corresponding to the stronger C-H 36
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
bond) needs higher reaction temperatures and stronger oxidizing phases to be produced than the most stable "rr-allyl-radical (corresponding to the weaker C-H bond breaking).
(2) It seems that, inversely, propylene reacts relatively smoothly over cata- lysts of partial oxidation of propane. Indeed, in this reaction, substantial yields of propylene are generally produced as compared to organic compounds or carbon oxides yields. This well indicates that the reactivity of propylene is relatively low in the conditions of the partial oxidation of propane. The phenomenon was kinetically quantified for the ammoxidation of propane over VSbO based catalysts [30,181,192]: the rate of selective oxidation of propylene intermediate was found lower than the rate of its non-selective oxidation to carbon oxides. From a practical point of view, it can be said that further improvements of the direct oxidation of propane to organic compounds passes through the improvement of the selective oxidation of propylene intermediate in order to overcome its oxidation to carbon oxides.
(3) Lattice oxygen atoms participate to the propylene oxidation to acrolein or acrylonitrile (see Section 4 and 5) over the different systems used (BiMoO, SbSnO, Cu20 mixed oxides) and the suggested active sites are bridged oxygen atoms M-O-M associated to the Mo=O double bond(s) for the BiMoO catalyst. Isolated sites are believed to give high selectivities [35]. The lattice oxygen atoms for the partial oxidation of propane to propylene over VMgO mixed oxides also participate to the reaction process, the active sites being V-O-V(Mg) and V=O [138,139,141]. Regarding the partial oxidation of propane to organic compounds, only a few number of studies have been undertaken concerning the nature of the active sites and the role of the lattice oxygen atoms. For the VSbO catalysts, it has been shown that vanadium and antimony are reduced during the reaction course and the selective site was proposed to be the complex system VSbO4/oSb204, interacting with the A1SbO 4 rutile phase when alumina is present in the used mixed oxide. In the case of MS+OPt4 (M = V, Mo, Nb, Ta), the ratios acrolein/propylene and acrylonitrile/propylene were found to be related to V=O bond strength [164].
Further investigations are needed to a better understanding of the involved processes.
5.2. Reaction mechanisms and intermediates in the partial oxidation of propane
The reaction mechanisms and intermediates (Tr-allyl, cr-allyl species) are now well established for the partial oxidation of propylene but not for propane partial oxidation. Taking into account the experimental data reported above, we can outline the reaction paths in the partial oxidation of propane to organic com- pounds as following:(i) the main route involves propylene intermediate for the BiMo(V)O, VSbO, NiMoTeO, CoMoTeO and VPTeO catalysts. Propylene production occurs on the
M.M. Bettahar et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
37 surface of the catalysts except for the BiMo(V)O catalyst for which propylene is formed in the gas phase. However, the direct oxidation of propane to oxygenate products was reported as the main route for the BPO catalysts. This route was also deduced kinetically but to a minor extent for the VSbO catalysts;(ii) the oxyhydration of the propylene intermediate leading to by-products (acetone/acetic acid, acetonitrile) competed with the allylic oxidation leading to the desired products (acrolein, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile) over the BiMo(V)O, VSbO, NiMoTeO, CoMoTeO and VPTeO catalysts.
The observed yields and selectivities depended on the nature of the catalysts and on the reaction conditions (notably on the presence and concentration of water or/and ammonia).
Regarding the reaction intermediates, it is widely believed [32-35,156] that propyl species are formed in the first and rate determining step during the ODHR of propane to propylene. As to the selective oxidation of propane to organic compounds, few details are known about the involved adsorbed species.It is implicitly believed that propyl species are first formed (in analogy with the ODHR of propane to propylene) and that "rr- and o'-allyl species are then successively formed (in analogy with the mechanisms of propylene oxidation to organic compounds). However, no experimental evidence has been reported up to now. The proposals are generally rather speculative and we summarize the discussions as following.The most important point discussed is the mode of activation of propane,because it determines the reaction rate and also, probably, the reaction selectivi- ties. For Michalakos et al. [35], the propyl radical is formed first and its reactivity determines the reaction selectivities. As for us, we have above reported that organic products seemed to be formed directly from propane in some cases, by-passing the propylene intermediate, we inferred that necessarily direct insertion of lattice oxygen occurs in the C-H bond of propane leading to 1-propyloxy or 2-propyloxy species formation as precursors of oxygenate prod- ucts and, even, of propylene (Scheme 8). An argument in favour of this route is the FT-IR results obtained by Finocchio et al. [169] showing the formation of 2-propyloxy adsorbed species leading to propylene intermediate then to organic products and CO x during the oxidation of propane over CrMgO mixed oxides.The alkoxy route is also in good accordance with crystallographic [40] and quantum [41] calculations showing that during the catalytic oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, the hydrocarbon molecules activation mainly occurs through the interaction between the lattice oxygen atoms and the terminal carbon atoms:the 1-4-n-butyl dioxy species was thus proposed as the initial precursor of maleic anhydride formation [40,41 ].In fact, the existence of both propyl and propyloxy species are not incompati- ble since the latter should stem from the former: C3H v  C3H70 38

Indeed, we proposed in Section 3 that propyl species as radical or ionic (cationic/anionic) species probably interact at the surface of the catalyst, the position of the equilibria depending on the nature of considered metal cation. Moreover, we can say that the distinction between propyl species adsorbed on a metal oxide and propyloxy species adsorbed on the same oxide should be difficult to establish experimentally, all the considered propyl species interact most probably with a lattice oxygen atom than with a surface metal cation: the carbon-oxygen interaction is expected to be stronger than the carbon-metal interaction.To conclude this point, and referring to Michalakos et al.'s [35] proposal, we think that the main route of propane activation involves its dissociative adsorp- tion to isopropyl or 2-propyloxy surface species leading to propylene then to the organic compounds (Scheme 11): the relative selectivities depend on the nature of the oxide and also probably on the structure of its surface since geometrical considerations have to be taken into account [35]. The other route should be the dissociative adsorption of propane as 1-propyloxy species by nucleophilic attack of the terminal CH 3 group by lattice 0 2 species (Scheme 8 and Fig. 11): the formation of the n-propyl species can be excluded because it should be too much unstable as compared to the isopropyl species. The 1-propyloxy species then transform either to propylene or to organic products. Thus, the propylene precursors may be both isopropyl or 1 and 2-propyloxy surface species; the latter should be also the precursor of organic compounds. The nature and the number of steps to organic products cannot be discussed because of the lack of experimental data reported in the literature. Scheme 13 summarizes the reaction paths above suggested.

5.3. Role of water
Water plays an important role in the catalytic selective oxidation of hydrocar- bons. Indeed, water is produced during the reaction, and, as such, should influence its course as reactant [25,26,126,127,197] or/and the stability of active phase of the catalyst [198,199] or that of the active sites [200,201].
For a better understanding of the chemical role of water, it is important to recall that the catalytic oxidation of an aldehyde to its corresponding carboxylic acid consists in its dissociation into carboxylate species [202] which then should desorb as carboxylic molecules (Scheme 12A). In analogy with oxidation of aldehydes with chromic acid or potassium permanganate in solution [203,204],gem-diol species (RCH(OH) 2) or their corresponding salt (RCH(OM) 2) are first formed by nucleophilic attack of O 2- or OH-species [205] then transformed into carboxylate species [204,205] (Scheme 12A). In the presence of water molecules the surface hydroxyl species concentration is high, then the nucleophilic attack probably mainly proceeds through these species (Scheme 12B). In addition, in the considered mechanism, water molecules are regenerated and thus water appears as a co-catalyst in the reaction (Scheme 12B). In connection, it is worthwhile to note that benzaldehyde is heterogeneously oxidized to benzoic acid by water over zirconium oxide [206]. In this case molecular hydrogen is evolved: ZrO 2 C6Hs-CHO + H20  C6Hs-COOH + H 2 40
M.M. Bettahar et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
This example clearly shows that water is both a nucleophilic and oxidizing reactant [207].
This behaviour of the water molecules explains the increase of acrylic acid selectivity at the expense of acrolein selectivity when their content is increased during the partial oxidation of propylene [118,121]: acrolein intermediate is oxidized to acrylic acid through the nucleophilic attack of water molecules. In absence of water in the feed gas, acrylic acid is more likely produced with the help of water formed during the reaction as observed for the partial oxidation of propylene [118,119]: in this case acrolein is observed as by-product, probably because water molecules are not in high enough concentration. The same behaviour of water is observed when propane is the feed gas [25,197]: for example, with a high water/propane ratio (> 16), acrolein is not formed but acrylic acid [24].
On the other hand, besides acrylic acid, substantial yields of acetic acid are obtained due to the oxyhydration [126,127] reaction of propylene (reactant or intermediate). Then the related yields of the carboxylic acids and acrolein reflects the competition of the corresponding routes of formation:

41 depending on the reaction conditions, the presence of water should be beneficial or detrimental or both to the desired valuable products (propylene, acrolein,acrylic acid) whatever the reactant feed (propane or propylene). For propylene as reaction product, it is obvious that the presence (or the addition) of water should be detrimental to its selectivity since its further oxidation to acetic acid and CO x through the hydration step should be enhanced [126,127]. This enhancement of acetic acid and CO, should also be detrimental to acrolein selectivity since the propylene intermediate should be deleted. On the other hand, water addition increases acrylic acid yields [25] at the expense of acrolein yields. If we only consider acrylic acid formation, water is both beneficial to its formation through acrolein oxidation and detrimental to its selectivity through the competitive formation of acetic acid [27]. As to acrylonitrile formation, it was shown that addition of water in the feed gas increased its rate of formation and selectivity [26], probably due to an increase of the rate of desorption of acrylonitrile, or, even, by favouring the oxyhydration of the acrolein intermedi- ate to acrylic acid then to acrylonitrile.
5.3.1. Role of the acid and the base sites
From the above discussion, it appears that the role of water (in-situ produced or added in the feed gas) is linked to the presence of acid-base sites during the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. This role should be more complex than generally believed as we have shown by an in-situ FT-IR study of the ODHR of propane to propylene over VPO/TiO 2 catalysts [201]. Indeed, at 350C, addi- tion of water decreased the yields of propylene and CO, (probably by competi- tive adsorption between water and propane) but increased the selectivity of the former at the expense of the latter. In the mean time, water increased the BriSnsted acid sites at the expense of the Lewis acid sites and a good correlation has been established between the formation of propylene and the Brtinsted acid sites in one hand and between the formation of CO 2 and the Lewis acid sites on the other hand.
Further, it is remarkable that BrSnsted acid sites are necessary to the formation of propylene [155,201] but, also, to its degradation to CO, through the oxyhydration reaction [126,127] (Scheme 1). It is probably the reason why decreasing the number of BriSnsted acid sites by incorporating alkaline or alkaline-earth cations to vanadium or molybdenum supported catalysts, de- creased the yields of both propylene and CO x for the ODHR of propane [150].
In the mean time an increase of the selectivity of propylene at the expense of the selectivity of CO x was observed [150]. This behaviour should be linked to the easier desorption of propylene on basic surface [34,35], but also to the difference of sensitivity of the reaction of formation of propylene and CO x to the nature and/or the strength of the catalyst surface acidity. On the other hand, an increase of the surface basicity should stop to a too great extent the reaction by the total inhibition of the propane activation. So, it can be said that a good 42
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
balance between the acid and the basic surface properties is required for the obtention of the desired product.
5.3.2. Role of the oxidizing sites
Obviously the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons depends on the acid-base properties but also on the redox properties of the used catalyst [7,121,207,208].
Among several examples we report the following ones: (i) the presence of alkaline cations on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts active for the ODHR of propane decreases both the reducibility of vanadium species and the number of surface acid sites [ 151,152]. The lower the reducibility of vanadium species the lower the catalytic activity is, independently of the alkane reactant, whereas the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depends both on the acid-base character of the catalysts and of the number of carbon atoms of the alkane reactant [151]; (ii) in the partial oxidation of propane to organic compounds incorporation of H3PMoI204o to a VPO catalyst enhanced the acetic acid yield rather than the acrylic acid yield [26]: as H3PMl12040 is both an acidic and an oxidizing additive, it may be concluded that the observed activity enhancement is due to the increase of both the surface acidity (which favours the hydration of the propylene intermediate) and the oxidizing power (which favours the oxida- tion of the alkoxy surface intermediate) of the catalyst; (iii) on the contrary, the incorporation of phosphorus (a surface acidity promoter) in the g205 catalyst led to a decrease of the oxidizing properties whereas it increased the allylic reaction relative to the oxyhydration reaction during the oxidation of propylene to acrylic acid [121]. So there is a mutual influence between the acid-base and the oxidizing properties of the surface for the metal mixed oxides. However,quantitative correlations between these properties and the catalytic performances cannot be easily determined. What one can say is that a good mix between the considered properties is necessary to obtain the desired product during the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons.
5.4. Role of ammonia
It is worth noting that the effect of ammonia depends on the nature of the catalyst and even, probably, on the nature of the reaction. Indeed, in the case of propane ammoxidation on the BiMo(V)O scheelite type catalysts [18-20],ammonia seems to only provide nucleophilic surface species which attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to acetonitrile:[o] R-CHO + NHza d  R-CH(NH)OH
R-C--=N
-2H20
Concerning the ammoxidation of propylene on the BiMoO or SbO [80] based catalysts or of propane on the VSbO catalysts [27-30,181,192] the situation is more complex. When the concentration of ammonia is increased in the propane
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
43 feed gas for example, propane conversion and CO x selectivity decrease, propy- lene selectivity increases whereas a maximum is observed for acrylonitrile selectivity (Table 7). These results then show a strong effect of ammonia on the surface properties of these catalysts:-- neutralisation of acidic (BrSnsted or Lewis) sites leading to the inhibition of propane activation, specially towards the total oxidation, thus explaining the decrease of propane conversion and CO x selectivity;-- reduction of the catalyst surface shown by N 2 formation, which enhances propylene selectivity in good accordance with results obtained for the ODHR of propane to propylene when the basicity of the catalysts was increased [138,139,201];-- increase of the nucleophilic character of the catalyst surface, which enhances the rate of the nucleophilic attack by NH 2 fragments of the carbonyl function of acrolein conjugated with the decrease of its oxidizing character (which inhibits acrolein formation) explaining the observed maximum in acryl- onitrile selectivity.
The above considerations also suggest that a good mix of the acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products.
6.
Conclusions If the selective oxidation of propylene is now a well established industrial process, the selective oxidation of propane to valuable products (propylene,acrolein acrylonitrile, acrylic acid) is a new challenge in catalytic oxidation and,though many obstacles have to be overcome, some promising results begin to be obtained. Indeed, fairly good performances have been obtained, notably for acrylonitrile production:65% of propylene selectivity at 15% of propane conversion over VMgO catalysts;65% of acrolein selectivity at 15% of propane conversion over BiMo(V)O catalysts 80% of acrylonitrile selectivity at 40% of propane conversion over VSbO catalysts.
These performances are by far lower than those obtained when propylene is the feedstock: up to 95% of acrolein selectivity at 90% of propylene conversion have been reported over Bi-Mo-O catalysts. This indicates that further work is needed for the improvement of the partial oxidation of propane.
From a fundamental point of view, if it is established that the propane activation is the rate determining step, the overall process of the selective oxidation of propane to organic products is still less understood. We can say that this process needs acid/oxidizing sites for the C-H bonds activation as well as basic/nucleophilic sites for protons abstraction (formation of C=C double 44
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
bond) or for the oxygen/nitrogen atom insertion (formation of the C-O/C-N bonds). Though the exact structure of these sites has still to be determined, the intervention of acidic (oxidant) and basic (nucleophilic) pairs of sites is impera- tive for each elementary step. This intervention is most probably concerted so as to minimize the required activation energies. The electronic structure of the organic adsorbed species has also to be taken into account in the involved elementary steps. In other words, the invoked elementary mechanisms as well as their number require a specific surface structure in order to obtain a high enough selectivity of the overall oxidation process. This explain the failure of obtaining performant catalysts for the partial oxidation of propane to organic compounds until now. So, a better knowledge of the structure of the demanded surface as well as a better understanding of the overall process (kinetics and mechanisms) are the key for the design of the active and selective catalysts. Comparative studies of propane and propylene partial oxidation should be also very useful. In this sense, we hope that the present review should be helpful.
