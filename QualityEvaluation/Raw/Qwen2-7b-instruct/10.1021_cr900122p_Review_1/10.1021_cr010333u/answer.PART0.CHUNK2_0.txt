[1] "The oxidation of olefins by molecular oxygen was applied commercially to ethylene, but oxygen epoxidation for larger olefins has been mostly unsuccessful using transition metal substituted molecular sieves as catalysts."
[2] "The failure to directly epoxidize allylic olefins to their corresponding epoxides, and more specifically the case of propylene, can be related to the fact that the bond dissociation energy of the allylic CH bond in propylene is 77 kcal mol-1 much smaller than the corresponding dissociation energy of the vinylic CH bond in ethylene that is 112 kcal mol-1."
[3] "Despite the high selectivities to propylene oxide obtained with the Au/TiO2 system, conversions are low, and turnover frequencies with this system for propylene epoxidation are on the order of 20200 times lower than for the epoxidation of ethylene with silver catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces several challenges that affect the process efficiency. The main catalysts utilized for this purpose include bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the need for precise control over the catalyst composition, structure, and the reaction conditions. The selectivity issues often arise due to the difficulty in isolating active sites for the desired reaction pathway. For instance, the activation of C-H bonds and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates are crucial steps. However, these processes can lead to unwanted side reactions, such as 2H-abstraction, which can compromise the selectivity. 

The efficiency of the process can be significantly influenced by the site isolation, which refers to the spatial arrangement and accessibility of the active sites on the catalyst. Well-isolated sites can enhance selectivity by limiting the formation of competing reaction pathways. For example, the use of supported catalysts, where the active site is embedded within the matrix, can offer better control over the reaction environment and thus potentially improve the selectivity.

To address selectivity issues, researchers are exploring various strategies. These include the design of catalysts with tailored Lewis acidity, the utilization of Lewis acid-assisted oxidation, and the development of new active sites inspired by enzyme structures. Bioinspiration and molecular modeling are emerging as powerful tools in catalyst design, enabling the creation of multifunctional catalysts with optimized site locations and strengths.

In summary, the challenges in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involve precise control over the reaction conditions, catalyst design, and site isolation. Advances in catalyst synthesis and the application of modern catalysis techniques, such as Lewis acid-assisted oxidation and bioinspired designs, aim to overcome these challenges and improve the efficiency of the process.

氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）过程面临着一些挑战，影响其效率。主要催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临的挑战包括催化剂组成的精确控制、结构和反应条件。选择性问题通常与激活C-H键和形成M-烷基中间体的难度有关。然而，这些过程可能会导致不希望的副反应，如2H消除，这会损害选择性。

过程效率可由催化剂点的隔离显著影响，这是指活性位点在催化剂中的空间排列和可达性。良好的点隔离可以增强选择性，通过限制期望反应途径的形成。例如，使用支持催化剂，其中活性位点嵌入在矩阵中，可以提供对反应环境的更好控制，从而可能提高选择性。

为了克服选择性问题，研究人员正在探索各种策略。这些包括催化剂设计的定制路易斯酸性，路易斯酸辅助氧化的应用，以及酶结构启发的新活性位点的发展。生物启发和分子建模作为催化设计的强大工具正在兴起，使能够创建具有优化位点位置和强度的多功能催化剂。

总之，氧化脱氢烷烃过程的挑战涉及对反应条件的精确控制、催化剂设计和点隔离。先进的催化剂合成方法和现代催化技术的应用，如路易斯酸辅助氧化和生物启发设计，旨在克服这些挑战并提高过程的效率。
