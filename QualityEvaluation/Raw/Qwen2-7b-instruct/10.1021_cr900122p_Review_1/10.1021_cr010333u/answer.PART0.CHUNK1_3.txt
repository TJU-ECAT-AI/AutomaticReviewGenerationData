[1] "It appears that both micro and mesoporous substituted molecular sieves can be promising heterogeneous catalysts for the MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reactions provided that Lewis acidity and solid polarity can be adjusted to the requirements of a particular reaction."
[2] "It has to be remarked, however, that while H2O2 gives a higher flexibility, the use of the organic peroxides in ARCO and SHELL processes can also be economically interesting if there is a market for the products formed."
[3] "The TS-1 oxidation of larger alkenes is diffusion-limited and then there is one opportunity for Ti-Beta which has larger pores to be more active than TS-1."
[4] "The use of TS-1 for production of propylene oxide would allow the use of H2O2 instead of the organic hydroperoxide used in ARCO and SHELL processes."
[5] "While acetone and methanol can be used as solvents, it has been found that the hydroxylation of benzene without any organic solvent, i.e., in a triphase system, is 20 times faster than when using acetone or acetonitrile as solvents."

1. Both micro and mesoporous substituted molecular sieves can be promising catalysts for MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reactions, provided that their Lewis acidity and solid polarity can be adjusted to suit specific reaction requirements.

2. The use of H2O2 provides more flexibility compared to organic peroxides, but the economic viability of using organic peroxides in processes like ARCO and SHELL depends on the market for the resulting products.

3. For the oxidation of larger alkenes, Ti-Beta zeolites, which have larger pores, can be more active than TS-1 due to the diffusion limitations encountered with TS-1.

4. TS-1 is suitable for the production of propylene oxide using H2O2 as an oxidant, offering an alternative to the organic hydroperoxides used in ARCO and SHELL processes.

5. Hydroxylation of benzene without any organic solvent, in a triphase system, is found to be 20 times faster than when using solvents like acetone or acetonitrile.

1. 微孔和介孔修饰分子筛在满足特定反应要求的情况下，可以是进行美尔威-庞德-弗里耶尔和奥朋纳尔反应的有前景的异相催化剂，前提是它们的路易斯酸性和固体极性可以进行调整。

2. 相比有机过氧化物，使用H2O2具有更高的灵活性，但ARCO和SHELL等过程中使用有机过氧化物的经济可行性取决于最终产品的市场。

3. 对于更大不饱和烃的氧化，具有更大孔径的Ti-Beta沸石可以比TS-1更有效，因为TS-1遇到扩散限制。

4. TS-1适用于使用H2O2作为氧化剂生产丙烯氧化物，提供了一种替代使用有机过氧化物的ARCO和SHELL过程的方法。

5. 没有有机溶剂的苯羟基化，在三相系统中比使用乙醇酮或乙腈作为溶剂时快20倍。
