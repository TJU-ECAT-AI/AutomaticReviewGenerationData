1. ARCO claims that a reaction cycle similar to the one described occurs with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, yielding propylene epoxide.
2. The noble metal facilitates the creation of H2O2 from H2 and O2, and TS-1 reacts the formed H2O2 with propylene to produce the epoxide.
3. An optimized catalyst achieves selectivities of up to 85% for propylene oxide at conversion levels between 15 and 20%.
4. The most straightforward approach to generate H2O2 in situ would be utilizing O2 and H2 following the methodology.
5. It is evident that this system warrants further investigation to uncover the underlying reasons for the observed low conversion.
6. An intriguing study reveals that, in the presence of a strong apolar solvent, only a negligible amount of Co is leached at conversion levels below 10%, which cannot account for the autoxidation activity.

1.ARCO声称，四烷基铵盐与蒽醌-2,6-二磺酸酸在甲醇水溶液中发生类似的反应循环，产生丙烯氧化物。
2.贵金属催化生成H2O2从H2和O2，而TS-1则与形成的H2O2反应丙烯生成环氧物。
3.优化催化剂在转化率在15至20%之间时可达到高达85%的丙烯氧化物选择性。
4.生成H2O2的最直接方法是使用O2和H2遵循该方法。
5.显而易见，此系统值得进一步研究以寻找低转化率的原因。
6.有趣的研究发现，在强非极性溶剂存在下，只有在转化率低于10%的情况下，Co的流失量极小（无法解释自动氧化活性）。
