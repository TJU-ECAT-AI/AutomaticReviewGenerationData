[1] "Following the methodology of generating H2O2 in situ, the most direct way to make this would be using O2 and H2. This is done by carrying out the propylene epoxidation on a bifunctional catalyst formed by Pd and Pt on TS-1. The noble metal catalyzes the formation of H2O2 from H2 and O2, while the TS-1 will react the formed H2O2 with propylene to give the epoxide."
[2] "There is no doubt that this system deserves further work trying to find the reasons for the low conversion obtained."
[3] "When a catalyst formed by gold dispersed on TS-1 is used to epoxidize propylene with H2O2 formed in situ by reacting H2 and O2 at low temperature, no propane is formed and the selectivity to epoxide is high (99%), but conversion is low (<2%)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process utilizes various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The interplay between these catalysts is crucial for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges arise in addressing selectivity issues, as exemplified by the low conversion obtained with some catalyst systems. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing these selectivity concerns. 

For instance, when gold is dispersed on TS-1, it can effectively generate H2O2 in situ from H2 and O2, leading to high epoxide selectivity. However, the conversion is notably low, indicating the need for further optimization. This highlights the importance of developing catalysts that can efficiently activate C-H bonds, form M-alkyl intermediates, and enable 2H-abstraction to enhance the overall process efficiency.

To address these challenges, researchers focus on refining catalyst composition, structure, and support materials. The goal is to create active sites that can selectively activate alkane molecules while minimizing unwanted side reactions. Site isolation techniques might also be employed to control the proximity and interactions between different active sites on the catalyst surface, thereby improving selectivity.

In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is a complex process influenced by the choice and design of catalysts. Addressing challenges such as selectivity and conversion requires a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms and innovative catalyst development strategies. Site isolation is one approach that can help in optimizing the performance of these catalysts.

氧化脱氢（ODH）过程使用各种催化剂，包括体金属氧化物和支持系统。这些催化剂之间的相互作用对于实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。在解决选择性问题时存在挑战，例如某些催化剂系统的低转化率。站点隔离在解决这些问题中起着重要作用。

例如，当将金分散在TS-1上时，它可以有效地从H2和O2生成H2O2在位，导致高环氧选择性。然而，转化率显著较低，表明需要进一步优化。这突出了有效活化烷烃分子、形成M-烷基中间体以及使2H-消除以提高整体过程效率的重要性。

为了解决这些挑战，研究人员关注催化剂组成、结构和支撑材料的改进。目标是创建可以选择性激活烷烃分子而减少副反应的活性位点。可能还采用隔离技术来控制催化剂表面不同活性位点之间的接近度和相互作用，从而改善选择性。

总之，烷烃的氧化脱氢是一个复杂的过程，受催化剂选择和设计的影响。通过深入理解基本机制并开发创新的催化剂策略来解决选择性和转化率的挑战。隔离站点是一种可以帮助优化这些催化剂性能的方法。
