[1] "There are drawbacks to this process, including the need to operate under conditions close to the explosion limit."
[2] "An optimized catalyst gives propylene oxide with selectivities up to 85% at conversions between 15 and 20%."
[3] "When a catalyst formed by gold dispersed on TS-1 is used to epoxidize propylene with H2O2 formed in situ by reacting H2 and O2 at low temperature, no propane is formed and the selectivity to epoxide is high (99%), but conversion is low (<2%)."
[4] "The interest of cyclohexane oxidation to produce cyclohexanone (for production of ε-caprolactam) and adipic acid (for producing polyamide fibers and polyurethane resins) strongly justify further efforts in looking for a selective heterogeneous catalyst for cyclohexane autoxidation."
[5] "Following the methodology of generating H2O2 in situ, the most direct way to make this would be using O2 and H2."
[6] "The existence of a radical mechanism for the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons using transition metals substituted AlPOs has been demonstrated by observing not only the reaction induction period and the diminishing of this when small amounts of a free radical initiator (TBHP) are added, but also by the reaction inhibitor effect of the well-known free radical scavenger hydroquinone."
