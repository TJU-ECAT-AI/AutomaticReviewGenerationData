[1] "Alkane oxidation with dioxygen through a radical mechanism is generally referred to as autoxidation and suffers from the relatively harsh conditions to be initiated and very low selectivity, due to secondary reactions of the primary products."
[2] "Although there have been major advances in the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons with molecular oxygen, the development of effective and selective methods for the catalytic functionalization of hydrocarbons still remains a major challenge in oxidation chemistry."
[3] "Enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and non-heme, iron-based oxidase are able to carry out selectively the oxyfunctionalization of alkanes with O2."
[4] "Inorganic catalysts such as transition metal complexes and metal substituted polyoxometalates either in homogeneous phase or supported on a solid carrier by anchoring in mesoporous materials or by encapsulation in microporous molecular sieves are effective when using oxidants such as iodosylbenzene, alkyl hydroperoxides, and hydrogen peroxide, and can, in some cases, also use molecular oxygen as oxidant."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the conversion of hydrocarbons into functionalized compounds by removing hydrogen atoms. Achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH is challenging due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the potential for secondary reactions. Catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of ODH processes. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are among the catalyst types used for this purpose.

Bulk metal oxides are known for their ability to activate C-H bonds through various mechanisms, such as the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates and the abstraction of 2H atoms. These processes facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds and the subsequent functionalization of alkanes. However, achieving high selectivity often requires careful control over the reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

Supported systems, like those based on mesoporous materials and microporous molecular sieves, offer enhanced selectivity and conversion. The encapsulation or anchoring of catalysts within these supports can isolate active sites, thereby influencing the reaction pathways and improving selectivity. Site isolation addresses selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific regions within the catalyst, preventing unwanted side reactions and promoting the desired functionalization of alkanes.

The development of effective and selective ODH methods is still a major challenge in oxidation chemistry. Advances in catalyst design, such as the use of inorganic catalysts in homogeneous or supported forms, have shown promise. These catalysts, including transition metal complexes and metal-substituted polyoxometalates, demonstrate activity when using oxidants like iodosylbenzene, alkyl hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and molecular oxygen.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH are closely tied to the interplay between catalysts, reaction conditions, and the intrinsic properties of the hydrocarbons being oxidized. Site isolation and the precise control of reaction mechanisms are key strategies to enhance the efficiency of these processes. Further research and innovation in catalyst development are essential for overcoming these challenges and advancing the field of oxidative dehydrogenation.

氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及到通过去除氢原子将烃转化为功能性化合物的过程。实现ODH过程中的高选择性和转化率存在挑战，原因在于反应路径的复杂性以及初级产物的潜在二次反应。催化剂在提高ODH过程效率中起着关键作用。

纯金属氧化物由于能够通过各种机制激活C-H键而被广泛使用，如形成金属-烷基中间体和2H原子的摘除。这些过程有助于C-H键的断裂和随后的烷烃的功能化。然而，要实现高选择性通常需要仔细控制反应条件和催化剂性质。

支撑系统，如基于介孔材料和微孔分子筛的体系，提供了增强选择性和转化的能力。催化剂的封装或锚定在这些支持物中可以隔离活性位点，从而影响反应路径并提高选择性。位点隔离通过限制反应发生在催化剂特定区域内，防止不希望的副反应并促进烷烃的期望功能化。

在氧化化学领域，有效和选择性的ODH方法仍是一个重大挑战。纯金属氧化物、均相或固载形式的催化剂等催化剂的发展显示出潜力。当使用碘代苯、烷基过氧化氢、过氧化氢和分子氧等氧化剂时，这些催化剂表现出活性。

实现ODH过程中的高选择性和转化率的挑战与催化剂、反应条件和被氧化的烃的内在性质密切相关。位点隔离和精确控制反应机制是提高这些过程效率的关键策略。进一步的研究和创新催化剂开发对于克服这些挑战并推进氧化脱氢领域至关重要。
