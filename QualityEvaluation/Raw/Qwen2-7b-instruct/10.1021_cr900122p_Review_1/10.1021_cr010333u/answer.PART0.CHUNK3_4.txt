[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a challenging reaction due to the difficulty in achieving high selectivity and conversion."

[2] "Bulk metal oxides such as ceria, titania, and zirconia have been extensively studied as catalysts for ODH reactions."

[3] "Supported metal catalysts, particularly noble metals like palladium and ruthenium, have shown improved selectivity and activity."

[4] "Catalyst site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining reactive intermediates and preventing unwanted side reactions."

[5] "Mechanistically, ODH reactions often involve C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent 2H-abstraction steps."

[6] "Efficiency of ODH processes is influenced by factors including catalyst type, support material, operating conditions, and the ability to control intermediate lifetimes."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. 

2. Bulk metal oxides, including ceria, titania, and zirconia, have been widely explored for their potential use in alkane dehydrogenation.

3. Supported metal catalysts, especially noble metals such as palladium and ruthenium, exhibit enhanced selectivity and activity compared to bulk counterparts.

4. Site isolation in catalyst design is critical for improving selectivity in ODH reactions by managing the lifetime of reactive intermediates and minimizing side reactions.

5. The ODH mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation, the creation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms to produce alkenes.

6. The efficiency of ODH processes depends on various factors, including the choice of catalyst, support material, operational conditions, and the control over the stability and reactivity of intermediates.
