1. Selectivity and conversion are crucial aspects in the synthesis of fine chemicals through oxidation reactions. Achieving high levels of selectivity and conversion poses significant challenges, particularly when aiming for chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity.

2. Metal dopants and promoters, like potassium, can modify the Lewis acidity of vanadium phosphate catalysts. This impacts the dispersion of vanadium species, reducing the number of exposed Lewis acid sites, and altering the redox ability of the vanadium species.

3. The activation energies for propane oxidative dehydrogenation are generally higher than those for propene combustion, indicating the complexity of the reaction pathway. The adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane also play a role in determining the relative rates of these reactions.

4. Potassium doping enhances the dispersion of vanadium species on the alumina support, leading to a decrease in the amount of exposed Al3+ Lewis acid sites. This results in a lower redox ability of the vanadium species.

5. The formaldehyde selectivity in the oxidation process increases linearly with the surface coverage at low conversions, suggesting that isolated V(V) species are responsible for the catalytic effect.

6. The oxidation of organic compounds to radical cations through electron transfer from the compound to a solid catalyst, like sulfated zirconia, correlates with the catalytic activity and product formation.

7. In oxidation reactions, metal atoms often do not undergo changes in their oxidation state. Instead, they act as Lewis acids by binding to the oxidizing reagent, like hydroperoxide, and enhancing its electrophilicity.

8. The use of soluble rhenium compounds as catalysts presents a challenge due to their inability to be reused after the catalytic process, limiting their practical application.

9. The hydrogen abstraction from isopropoxy groups adsorbed on the catalyst surface is identified as the rate-limiting step in the alkane oxidative dehydrogenation process.

10. Polyoxovanadate catalysts are active in converting highly toxic substances like bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide into less harmful sulfoxides using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidant.

11. Incorporating iron into heteropolyacids can significantly enhance their catalytic activity, increasing the yield of desired products. However, this may come at the expense of decreased selectivity.

12. Electrostatically immobilized polyoxometales as heterogeneous catalysts suffer from leaching of metals, which diminishes their effectiveness and reduces their attractiveness for large-scale applications.
