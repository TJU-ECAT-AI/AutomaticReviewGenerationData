[1] "An analogous reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide."
[2] "Following the methodology of generating H2O2 in situ, the most direct way to make this would be using O2 and H2. This is done by carrying out the propylene epoxidation on a bifunctional catalyst formed by Pd and Pt on TS-1."
[3] "The noble metal catalyzes the formation of H2O2 from H2 and O2, while the TS-1 will react the formed H2O2 with propylene to give the epoxide."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by a variety of factors including the choice of catalyst, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. The process often involves the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of hydrogen atoms. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for the selective activation and reaction of specific alkyl groups. The efficiency of the process is affected by the balance between these factors, and the use of appropriate catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, can significantly enhance the yield and selectivity of the desired products.
