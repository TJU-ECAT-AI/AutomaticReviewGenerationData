[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is an important process for producing alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones from alkanes."
[2] "Various catalysts have been developed for the ODH reaction, including bulk metal oxides such as copper, iron, and manganese oxide, and supported systems like metal oxides on supports like alumina, silica, or zeolites."
[3] "High selectivity and conversion are challenging goals in ODH due to the difficulty in activating the C-H bonds of alkanes and preventing unwanted side reactions."
[4] "Proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation by the catalyst, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent hydrogen abstraction to form alkenes, aldehydes, or ketones."
[5] "Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining reactive species and preventing non-desired side reactions."
[6] "Efficiency of ODH processes is influenced by catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability, as well as reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and solvent choice."
