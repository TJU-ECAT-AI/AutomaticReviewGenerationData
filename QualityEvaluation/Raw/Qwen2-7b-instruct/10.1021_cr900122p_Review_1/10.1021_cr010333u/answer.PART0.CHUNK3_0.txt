The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are employed in this process. The interplay between these catalysts contributes to the overall efficiency of ODH. Site isolation strategies have been developed to tackle selectivity issues. The mechanisms typically involve the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H atoms. Understanding these factors is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of the ODH process.
