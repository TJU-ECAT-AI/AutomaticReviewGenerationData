[1] "In the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, the yield of anhydride and the proportion of the strongest Lewis acid sites increases with time on stream."
[2] "The presence of gaseous oxygen lowers the amount of coordinated ammonia, probably due to the formation of amido NH2 species."
[3] "The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support as, for instance, in alkane oxidation."
[4] "Among the series of Lewis acids tested, the oxidation rate follows the order AlCl3 > FeCl3 >MgCl2 > LiCl > ZnCl2."
[5] "In the classical MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction, a carbonylic compound becomes reduced using 2-propanol as solvent and reducing agent in the presence of aluminum isopropoxide as catalyst."

1. The yield of maleic anhydride and the concentration of the strongest Lewis acid sites on the catalyst increase over time during the oxidation of n-butane.
2. Gaseous oxygen reduces the amount of coordinated ammonia by forming amido NH2 species.
3. The activity of vanadium oxide catalysts can be enhanced by incorporating Lewis acid properties into the support material, particularly in alkane oxidation processes.
4. The tested Lewis acids follow the order AlCl3 > FeCl3 >MgCl2 > LiCl > ZnCl2 in terms of their effectiveness for alkane oxidation.
5. In the MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction, a carbonylic compound is reduced using 2-propanol as solvent and aluminum isopropoxide as catalyst.
