[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes has been widely studied as a promising alternative to conventional methods for producing olefins, which are key feedstocks for the petrochemical industry."
[2] "A variety of catalysts have been employed in ODH processes, including bulk metal oxides such as V2O5, WO3, and MoO3, as well as supported catalysts based on noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Rh."
[3] "However, achieving high conversion and selectivity in ODH reactions remains challenging due to the complex nature of the C-H bond activation step and the potential for competing side reactions."
[4] "Mechanistically, the ODH process involves activation of the alkane C-H bond, formation of a C-M (metal) alkyl intermediate, and subsequent 2H-abstraction leading to the formation of an alkene."
[5] "Site isolation within heterogeneous catalyst supports can play a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by limiting access to competing pathways and promoting the desired reaction pathway."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes presents a promising method for producing olefins, commonly used in the petrochemical industry. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported noble metals, are utilized in these processes. Despite the potential of these catalysts, achieving both high conversion and selectivity is difficult due to the intricate nature of C-H bond activation and the presence of competing reactions. The ODH mechanism typically involves activation of the alkane's C-H bond, creation of a C-M alkyl intermediate, followed by 2H-abstraction resulting in an alkene. Site isolation within heterogeneous catalyst supports aids in increasing selectivity by restricting access to alternative reaction pathways, thereby promoting the desired conversion process.
