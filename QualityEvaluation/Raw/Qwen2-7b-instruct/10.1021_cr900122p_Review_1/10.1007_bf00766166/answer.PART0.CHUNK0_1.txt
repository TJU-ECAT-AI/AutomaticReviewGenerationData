[1] "Mechanistic considerations show that pressure must be taken into account in evaluating oxidative coupling catalyst performance, and predict an upper limit of around 30% yield of higher hydrocarbons at one atmosphere."
[2] "While indisputable forecasts of the engineering feasibility of this approach and its economic competitiveness with current technology are not yet available, it has been estimated that around 20-25% per pass yield (conversion times selectivity) of higher hydrocarbon products would be the minimum requirement for a viable process [2]."
[3] "In fact, there are a number of literature reports with quite different catalysts that appear to meet or surpass this target, suggesting that even substantially better yields might be achieved with the right catalyst."
[4] "However, mechanistic constraints seem to place an upper bound on yield, independent of catalyst, which is not far above the target values."
[5] "This latter presents arguments in support of these claims."
[6] "Curve a is the baseline [3]; in the rest, k s is adjusted to 150 times k 1, while the set of rates k 3, k 6, k 9, kl0 and k14 are all set at 1 (b), 3 (c), and 10 (d) times their baseline values. From the resulting curves, there appears to be a mechanistically imposed limit of around 30% yield at 1 atmosphere."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, poses significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Catalyst efficiency is influenced by factors such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The reaction mechanisms highlight the importance of C-H bond activation, where metal centers facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds, leading to alkyl intermediates. These intermediates can then undergo further reactions, such as hydrogen abstraction, to produce alkenes or other desired products. The selectivity of the process is greatly influenced by the catalyst's ability to control the relative rates of different reactions, particularly those that lead to the formation of CO2.

The proposed reaction mechanisms also emphasize the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites on the catalyst surface, the likelihood of unwanted side reactions, such as direct conversion of methane to CO2, is reduced. This allows for a more efficient use of reactants and a higher yield of desired products.

The mechanistic underpinnings of these processes are supported by studies conducted on a single catalyst in redox mode. The findings regarding pressure trends, the crucial role of ethylene as a CO2 precursor, and the similarities between product distributions using the same catalyst in redox and cofeed mode suggest that the conclusions drawn are applicable to other catalysts, including those with cofed oxygen. This indicates that the mechanisms described are not only specific to the catalyst used in the studies but may be generalized across different catalyst systems.

Investing in a major program aimed at improving oxidative coupling performance might not necessarily lead to substantial improvements in process efficiency. The presence of mechanistically imposed limits, such as the upper bound of around 30% yield at 1 atmosphere, suggests that achieving yields significantly higher than this target might be challenging, regardless of catalyst optimization efforts. Therefore, the expected gains from such investments might not justify the cost and resources required, given the inherent limitations imposed by the reaction mechanisms.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程时，各种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）之间的相互作用对实现高选择性和转化率构成了挑战。催化剂效率受到如C-H键激活、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽象等反应机制的影响。通过隔离活性位点，可以有效减少不需要的副反应，从而解决选择性问题。

反应机制强调了C-H键激活的重要性，其中金属中心促进C-H键的断裂，产生烷基中间体。这些中间体随后可以进一步反应，例如氢原子抽象，以生成烯烃或其他所需产物。选择性主要取决于催化剂控制不同反应相对速率的能力，特别是那些导致二氧化碳形成的反应。

提出的反应机制还强调了位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的关键作用。通过在催化剂表面隔离活性位点，可以减少不希望的副反应的可能性，如甲烷直接转化为二氧化碳的机会。这使得反应物更有效地使用并提高目标产品的产率。

这些过程的机制研究支持单个催化剂在还原模式下进行的研究。关于压力趋势、乙烷作为二氧化碳前体的关键作用以及使用相同催化剂在还原模式和共供给模式下获得的产品分布相似性的发现表明，这些结论适用于其他催化剂，包括共供给氧气的催化剂。这表明描述的机制不仅局限于研究中使用的催化剂，而且可能适用于不同的催化剂体系。

投资一个旨在改善氧化耦合性能的重大计划可能不一定能带来实质性的改进。存在由反应机制施加的限制，如大约在1大气压下30%的产量上限，这意味着无论催化剂优化努力如何，实现超过这一目标的产率可能具有挑战性。因此，预期从这些投资中获得的收益可能不值得投入的成本和资源，考虑到存在的固有限制。
