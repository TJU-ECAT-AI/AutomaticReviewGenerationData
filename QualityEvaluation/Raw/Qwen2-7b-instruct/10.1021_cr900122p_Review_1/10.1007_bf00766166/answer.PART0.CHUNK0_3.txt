[1] "Mechanistic considerations, however suggest that this picture may be much too optimistic."
[2] "There is a pronounced pressure effect which makes many of the published results appear better than they will be under practical conditions."
[3] "Point 2 implies that at high conversion, where most of the CO2 is produced sequentially from ethylene rather than directly from CH3, selectivity will decrease as pressure increases."
[4] "It can be seen that very few catalysts in the literature approach the target of 25% yield at or above atmospheric pressure, which will certainly be needed in a practical process."
[5] "What, then, can be done to improve performance? Conceptually, two things:(i) Increase overall catalyst activity."
[6] "Curve a is the baseline [3]; in the rest, ks is adjusted to 150 times k1, while the set of rates k3, k6, k9, k10 and k14 are all set at 1 (b), 3 (c), and 10 (d) times their baseline values."
[7] "From the resulting curves, there appears to be a mechanistically imposed limit of around 30% yield at 1 atmosphere."
[8] "However, there is considerable evidence that the mechanisms for other catalysts, even with co-fed oxygen, are closely similar if not identical."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights several key factors influencing process efficiency and selectivity. Catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in the ODH process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are evident, with various mechanisms proposed to explain these phenomena, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors determines the overall process efficiency.

Site isolation emerges as a potential strategy to address selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, the catalyst's ability to selectively convert alkanes to desired products can be enhanced, thereby improving the process's efficiency. However, the literature suggests that achieving significant improvements in performance, beyond the predicted 30% yield at 1 atmosphere, might not be feasible with existing catalysts and methods.

Moreover, the pressure effect is a critical consideration in evaluating catalyst performance. At higher pressures, the selectivity decreases due to the increased production of CO2 from ethylene rather than directly from CH3. This effect is exacerbated in practical conditions, making many published results appear more favorable than expected under real-world applications.

Investing in major programs aimed at substantial improvements in ODH performance might not be a wise decision based on the mechanistic understanding presented in the literature. The findings indicate that the inherent limitations in catalyst performance, influenced by factors such as pressure and reaction pathways, pose significant barriers to achieving high yields and selectivities. Therefore, while efforts to enhance catalyst activity and modify reaction mechanisms can theoretically improve performance, the extent to which these strategies can overcome the established limits remains uncertain.

在分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程中，文献强调了几种关键因素影响着过程效率和选择性。包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统在内的催化剂在ODH过程中扮演着重要角色。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战显而易见，提出了多种机制来解释这些现象，例如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-摘取。这些因素之间的相互作用决定了整个过程的效率。

通过隔离活性位点，可能成为解决选择性问题的一种策略，从而增强催化剂将烷烃转化为所需产物的能力，进而提高过程效率。然而，文献表明，在现有催化剂和方法的基础上，超越预测的每大气压下约30%的产量，实现显著的性能改进可能不是明智的选择。

此外，压力效应是评估催化剂性能时必须考虑的关键因素。在较高压力下，选择性会因乙烷直接从CH3生成二氧化碳而增加。这种效应在实际条件下被放大，使得许多发表的结果在预期的实际应用条件下显得更为有利。

基于文献中提出的机制理解，投资于主要项目，旨在实现ODH性能的重大改进可能不是一个明智的决定。研究结果表明，由压力和反应途径等因素引发的内在局限性，对实现高产率和选择性构成了重大障碍。因此，虽然努力提高催化剂活性并修改反应机制理论上可以改善性能，但这些策略克服已建立限制的程度仍然存在不确定性。
