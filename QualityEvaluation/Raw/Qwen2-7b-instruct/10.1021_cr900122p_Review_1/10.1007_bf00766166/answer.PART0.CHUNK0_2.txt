[1] "While indisputable forecasts of the engineering feasibility of this approach and its economic competitiveness with current technology are not yet available, it has been estimated that around 20-25% per pass yield (conversion times selectivity) of higher hydrocarbon products would be the minimum requirement for a viable process."
[2] "This latter presents arguments in support of these claims."
[3] "What, then, can be done to improve performance?"
[4] "Conceptually, two things:(i) Increase overall catalyst activity."
[5] "Using gas-phase studies on O atom reactions as the best available model [11], a value of 150 can be taken as a lower limit."
[6] "Curve a is the baseline [3]; in the rest, k s is adjusted to 150 times k 1, while the set of rates k 3, k 6, k 9, kl0 and k14 are all set at 1 (b), 3 (c), and 10 (d) times their baseline values."
[7] "It may thus be argued that these conclusions are general."

To address the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in the oxidative coupling of methane, efforts can focus on two main strategies: increasing catalyst activity and reducing the relative rate for the conversion of methane to carbon dioxide. Achieving higher activity can decrease the significance of gas-phase reactions that produce carbon dioxide. Decreasing the rate for methane-to-carbon dioxide conversion involves altering the mechanism of the reaction, possibly through modifying the catalyst. With catalyst activity increased by 3-10 times compared to the baseline, and the rate of methane conversion reduced to 150 times its original value, the system reaches a mechanistically imposed limit of around 30% yield at one atmosphere, which is not often approached in published results.

为了应对甲烷氧化耦合过程中高选择性和转化率的挑战，可以采取两大主要策略：提高催化剂活性和减少甲烷转化为二氧化碳的相对速率。通过提高活性，可以降低产生二氧化碳的气相反应的重要性。减少甲烷转化为二氧化碳的速率涉及改变反应机制，可能需要调整催化剂。与基线相比，将催化剂活性提高3至10倍，并将甲烷转换速率减少到原始值的150倍，系统达到一个机理限制的极限，即在1个大气压下约30%的产率，这一结果在已发表的结果中往往未达到或接近。
