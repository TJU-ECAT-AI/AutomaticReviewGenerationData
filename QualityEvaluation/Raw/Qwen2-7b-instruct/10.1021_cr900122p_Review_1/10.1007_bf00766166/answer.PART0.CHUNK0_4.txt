[1] "Mechanistic considerations, however suggest that this picture may be much too optimistic."
[2] "First,there is a pronounced pressure effect which makes many of the published results appear better than they will be under practical conditions; second, mechanistic constraints seem to place an upper bound on yield, independent of catalyst, which is not far above the target values."
[3] "Curve a is the baseline [3]; in the rest, k s is adjusted to 150 times k 1, while the set of rates k 3, k 6, k 9, kl0 and k14 are all set at 1 (b), 3 (c), and 10 (d) times their baseline values."
[4] "From the resulting curves, there appears to be a mechanistically imposed limit of around 30% yield at 1 atmosphere. This limit has not been exceeded (or indeed often approached, as seen in fig. 1) by any published results."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative coupling of methane faces inherent limitations regarding selectivity and yield, especially at higher conversion rates. These limitations are influenced by several factors including the pressure effect and mechanistic constraints on the yield. There is a mechanistically imposed upper limit of around 30% yield at one atmosphere, which has rarely been approached or exceeded in published results.

甲烷氧化耦合在选择性和产率方面面临固有限制，尤其是在高转化率情况下。这些限制受到压力效应和产率上限的影响。存在一个约30%的产率上限，在一个大气压下，这一上限在已发表的结果中很少被超越或接近。
