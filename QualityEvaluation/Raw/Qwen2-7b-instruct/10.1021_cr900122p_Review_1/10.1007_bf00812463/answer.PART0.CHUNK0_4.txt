[1] "Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica [4-6], alumina [7,8], titania [4,7,9] or AIPO4 [10]."
[2] "Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."
[3] "We report here a study of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia in which the samples were characterized with Raman spectroscopy to understand the changes in the selectivities for maleic anhydride in the oxidation of butane."
[4] "Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly."
[5] "At low conversions, PV0.0 produced primarily a mixture of 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene but very little maleic anhydride [12]."
[6] "Although unsupported V-P-O has the greatest selectivity for maleic anhydride at a P : V ratio of approximately unity, the selectivity for maleic anhydride for the supported catalysts increased from 23 to 48% with a corresponding increase in the P : V ratio from 0.6 to about 2.8."
[7] "Changes in the samples could be observed with Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of the samples."
[8] "Treatment of 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 with triethylphosphate resulted in the formation of VOPO4, which was hydrated to VOPO4.2H20 upon exposure to moisture."
[9] "From these results, one would expect that if the samples were prepared in a reducing atmosphere, fine crystallites of supported (VO)2P207 could be produced with catalytic properties similar to the unsupported samples."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves considering various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the ability to control the reaction pathways effectively. High selectivity is crucial for efficient conversion, as it minimizes unwanted side reactions and maximizes the desired product yield. The proposed reaction mechanisms, including C-H bond activation, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, contribute to the process efficiency by facilitating the desired transformations while avoiding undesired byproducts.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues in supported catalysts. By confining reactive sites within the catalyst structure, the probability of direct contact between reactants and non-reactive sites decreases, thereby enhancing the selectivity towards the desired product. This approach ensures that the reaction occurs more efficiently, as it directs the reactivity towards the intended pathway rather than allowing it to proceed through alternative, less favorable routes.

In the context of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia catalysts, phosphorus modification enhances the yield of maleic anhydride in the partial oxidation of butane. Varying the phosphorus-to-vanadium atomic ratio increases the selectivity to maleic anhydride, with the selectivity nearly constant up to 20% butane conversion and for different O2/C4H10 ratios. The Raman spectra of the phosphorus-modified samples reveal the presence of VOPO4 and its hydrate, VOPO4.2H20, suggesting the formation of these compounds plays a key role in the enhanced selectivity for maleic anhydride production. The catalysts' properties, including their selectivity and activity, are influenced by factors such as the phosphorus-to-vanadium ratio, the preparation method, and the reaction conditions.

In summary, the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the ability to control reaction pathways are pivotal in achieving high selectivity and conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Site isolation techniques can enhance selectivity by directing reactivity towards the desired product, as demonstrated by the phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia catalysts. The formation of specific compounds, like VOPO4 and its hydrate, contributes to the improved selectivity for maleic anhydride production in these systems.

氧化脱氢反应（ODH）的分析涉及考虑各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化的挑战通常源于催化剂组成、反应条件以及有效控制反应途径的能力。高选择性对于提高效率至关重要，因为它最小化了副反应，并最大化了所需产物的产率。提出的反应机制，包括C-H键激活、形成金属-烷基中间体和2H-摘除，通过促进所需转变并避免非期望的副产物来增强过程效率。

位点隔离在解决支持催化剂的选择性问题中起着重要作用。通过将活性位点限制在催化剂结构内，直接接触反应物与非活性位点的概率降低，从而提高对所需产品的选择性。这种方法确保反应更高效地进行，因为它将反应导向预期路径而非允许其通过不太有利的路径进行。

在磷改性的硅基负载钒催化剂的背景下，磷改性提高了正丁烷部分氧化制备马来酸酐的产率。通过改变磷与钒的原子比，选择性增加了48%，与未改性的催化剂相比。选择性几乎在20%正丁烷转化率和不同的O2/C4H10比例下保持不变。磷改性的样品的拉曼光谱揭示了VOPO4及其水合物的存在，表明这些化合物的形成对马来酸酐生产的选择性增强起到了关键作用。催化剂的性质，如选择性、活性等，受磷与钒的比例、制备方法和反应条件等因素的影响。

综上所述，在氧化脱氢正烷烃的过程中，催化剂组成、反应条件以及有效控制反应途径的能力是实现高选择性和转化的关键因素。通过位点隔离技术可以增强选择性，因为它将反应导向预期的产品。VOPO4及其水合物的形成有助于这些系统中马来酸酐生产选择性提高。
