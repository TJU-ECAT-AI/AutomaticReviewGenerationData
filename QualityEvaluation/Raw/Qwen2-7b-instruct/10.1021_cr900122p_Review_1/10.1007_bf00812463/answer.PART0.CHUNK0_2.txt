[1] "Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica [4-6], alumina [7,8], titania [4,7,9] or AIPO4 [10]."
[2] "Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."
[3] "We report here a study of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia in which the samples were characterized with Raman spectroscopy to understand the changes in the selectivities for maleic anhydride in the oxidation of butane."
[4] "Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly."
[5] "All phosphorus-modified catalysts had higher selectivities for maleic anhydride."
[6] "The effect of 02 : butane ratio in the feed was investigated with the PV2.8 sample. Under steady state conditions, a more oxidizing reaction mixture of 77/22/1 He/O2/C4 produced slightly lower activity and maleic anhydride selectivity, being 36.8%, than if the feed was an 88/8/4 He/O2/C4 mixture."
[7] "Changes in the samples could be observed with Raman spectroscopy."
[8] "Treatment of 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 with triethylphosphate resulted in the formation of VOPO4, which was hydrated to VOPO4.2H20 upon exposure to moisture."
[9] "Over unsupported a-VOPO4, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride with a selectivity of about 50%."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles. The key factors influencing process efficiency are the ability to activate C-H bonds, generate M-alkyl intermediates, and perform 2H-abstraction. Site isolation, achieved through the use of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia catalysts, helps address selectivity issues. Specifically, phosphorus modification enhances the yield of maleic anhydride, attributed to the formation of very small crystallites of VOPO4·H2O and I-VOPO4, which exhibit similar catalytic properties to the unsupported oxides. The optimization of oxygen-to-butane ratios also impacts selectivity, with a more oxidizing environment leading to lower selectivity for maleic anhydride. Raman spectroscopy provides insights into the structural changes in the catalysts during the reaction.

在分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程中，文献强调了实现高选择性和转化率的挑战。各种催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和支撑系统，在此过程中发挥关键作用。影响过程效率的关键因素是激活C-H键的能力、生成M-烷基中间体以及执行2H-消除。通过使用磷改性的硅基负载范德华催化剂，实现了对选择性问题的隔离。具体来说，磷改性增强了马来酸酐的产率，归因于形成了非常小的晶粒VOPO4·H2O和I-VOPO4，这些物质具有与未支持氧化物相似的催化性能。氧比-丁烷比例的优化也影响了选择性，更氧化的环境导致了马来酸酐选择性的降低。拉曼光谱提供了关于反应期间催化剂结构变化的见解。
