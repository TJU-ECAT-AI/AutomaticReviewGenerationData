[1] "Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica [4-6], alumina [7,8], titania [4,7,9] or AIPO4 [10]."
[2] "Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."
[3] "It has been reported that over unsupported a-VOPO4, butane is oxidized to maleic anhydride with a selectivity of about 50% [19], a value observed with samples PV2.4, PV2.8 and PV3.2."
[4] "The formation of VOPO4 instead of (VO)2P207 was a result of the preparation procedure."
[5] "Therefore, the poor selectivity for maleic anhydride reported in the literature for supported V-P-O catalysts probably is because some of the vanadium ions in those samples did not form vanadyl pyrophosphate or vanadyl phosphate due to deposition of some of the phosphorus on the support."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise from the difficulty in efficiently activating C-H bonds, generating M-alkyl intermediates, and performing 2H-abstraction reactions. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining reactive species to specific locations, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process. In the context of supported vanadium-phosphorus-oxygen catalysts, the selectivity to maleic anhydride production is often lower compared to unsupported catalysts. This is attributed to the deposition of phosphorus on the support, which prevents some vanadium ions from forming vanadyl pyrophosphate or vanadyl phosphate, thus affecting the catalytic properties and selectivity.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及催化剂间的复杂相互作用，包括单质金属氧化物和负载系统。在高效活化C-H键、生成M-烷基中间体以及进行2H-摘除反应方面存在挑战，这直接影响了转化率和选择性。通过隔离活性位点，可以提高过程效率并解决选择性问题。对于负载型钨磷氧催化剂而言，与非负载催化剂相比，其马来酸酐的选择性较低。这一现象归因于支持物上磷的沉积，阻止了一些钨离子形成钨磷酸或钨磷磷酸盐，从而影响催化特性和选择性。
