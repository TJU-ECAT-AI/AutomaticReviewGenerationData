1. Introduction: "Alkanes are attractive alternative feedstocks for chemical synthesis. Compared to their aromatic counterparts, alkanes are both relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly."
2. Results and discussion: "The TEP impregnated 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 sample (VP0.0) evolved methanol, small amounts of TEP, and trace amounts of acetaldehyde when purged with helium in the reactor at room temperature."
3. Results and discussion: "Only a limited amount of phosphorus was retained by the catalysts in any one impregnation. In a series of experiments, sufficient TEP to produce samples with P : V ratios of 0.6, 1.0, and 2.0 was impregnated onto PV0.0. In every case the cata- lysts after calcination had P : V ratios of approximately 0.6."
4. Results and discussion: "Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly. Table 2 shows the product distributions for each sample at two butane conversions for reactions at 425 with 88/8/4 mixtures of He/O2/C4."
5. Results and discussion: "The effect of 02 : butane ratio in the feed was investigated with the PV2.8 sample. Under steady state conditions, a more oxidizing reaction mixture of 77/22/1 He/O2/C4 produced slightly lower activity and maleic anhydride selectivity, being 36.8%, than if the feed was an 88/8/4 He/O2/C4 mixture."
6. Results and discussion: "The activation energies for butane consumption on the phosphorus-modified catalysts also differed from that of PV0.0. They were calculated from data obtained between 400 and 450 at less than 8% butane conversion."
7. Results and discussion: "Changes in the samples could be observed with Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of the samples."

1. Alkanes are considered suitable alternatives for chemical synthesis due to their affordability and environmental friendliness compared to aromatic compounds.
2. When subjected to oxidative conditions, a phosphorus-modified catalyst evolved methanol, small quantities of triethylphosphate, and trace amounts of acetaldehyde.
3. The phosphorus content in the catalysts varied according to the impregnation process, with P : V ratios of approximately 0.6 being common across multiple experiments.
4. Phosphorus modification led to significant changes in product selectivity. Detailed product distributions were presented for different catalyst samples at varying butane conversions.
5. The use of a more oxidizing feed mixture reduced the activity and maleic anhydride selectivity of the phosphorus-modified catalyst compared to a less oxidizing mixture.
6. Activation energies for butane consumption on the phosphorus-modified catalysts were lower than those of the unmodified catalyst, differing from PV0.0.
7. Raman spectroscopy revealed changes in the catalyst samples, including the presence of bands characteristic of VOPO4 and its hydrate, VOPO4.2H2O.
