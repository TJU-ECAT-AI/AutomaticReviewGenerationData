[1] "Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica [4-6], alumina [7,8], titania [4,7,9] or AIPO4 [10]."
[2] "Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."
[3] "It was concluded that the active phases in these samples were a-VOPO4."
[4] "From these results,one would expect that if the samples were prepared in a reducing atmosphere, fine crystallites of supported (VO)zP207 could be produced with catalytic properties similar to the unsupported samples."

1. Various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include interactions between the catalysts and the alkane molecules, as well as the complex nature of the reaction pathways involving C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by preventing unwanted side reactions.

2. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability of the catalysts to activate the alkane molecules, facilitate the desired reaction pathways, and minimize non-selective transformations. Achieving high selectivity often requires precise control over the catalyst structure and composition.

3. The formation of VOPO4 instead of (VO)2P207 during the preparation process leads to the production of very small crystallites of VOPO4·H2O and I-VOPO4, which exhibit similar catalytic properties to the unsupported oxides. This suggests that the poor selectivity of supported V-P-O catalysts may be attributed to the deposition of phosphorus on the support, leading to incomplete formation of vanadyl pyrophosphate or vanadyl phosphate.

4. By preparing the samples in a reducing atmosphere, one can expect to produce fine crystallites of supported (VO)2P207, which are anticipated to have catalytic properties akin to the unsupported samples, thus potentially improving the selectivity and efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1. 近年来，一些团队尝试将V-P-O催化剂支持在硅酸盐、氧化铝、二氧化钛或AIPO4上。这些催化剂在生产马来酸酐时的选择性通常低于非支持型催化剂，这给高选择性和转化率的实现带来了挑战。反应途径涉及C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体和2H-消除，需要精确控制催化剂结构和组成以实现高效催化。

2. 过程效率受到催化剂激活烷烃分子、促进期望反应路径以及减少非选择性转化的能力影响。要实现高选择性，往往需要精确控制催化剂的结构和组成。

3. 在制备过程中形成VOPO4而不是(VO)2P207导致产生非常小的晶粒VOPO4·H2O和I-VOPO4，这些物质具有与无支撑氧化物相似的催化性质。这表明支持型V-P-O催化剂选择性差可能是由于磷沉积在支撑材料上，导致部分范德华磷酸或范德华磷酸的不完全形成。

4. 如果在还原气氛中制备样品，可以预期生成细小晶粒的（VO）2P207，其催化性能与无支撑样本类似，从而可能提高氧化脱氢过程的选择性和效率。
