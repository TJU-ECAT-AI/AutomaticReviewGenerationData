[3] "It was concluded that the active phases in these samples were a-VOPO4."

1. Various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include interactions between the catalysts and the alkane molecules, as well as the complex nature of the reaction pathways involving C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by preventing unwanted side reactions.

2. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability of the catalysts to activate the alkane molecules, facilitate the desired reaction pathways, and minimize non-selective transformations. Achieving high selectivity often requires precise control over the catalyst structure and composition.

3. The formation of VOPO4 instead of (VO)2P207 during the preparation process leads to the production of very small crystallites of VOPO4·H2O and I-VOPO4, which exhibit similar catalytic properties to the unsupported oxides. This suggests that the poor selectivity of supported V-P-O catalysts may be attributed to the deposition of phosphorus on the support, leading to incomplete formation of vanadyl pyrophosphate or vanadyl phosphate.

4. By preparing the samples in a reducing atmosphere, one can expect to produce fine crystallites of supported (VO)2P207, which are anticipated to have catalytic properties akin to the unsupported samples, thus potentially improving the selectivity and efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1. 近年来，一些团队尝试将V-P-O催化剂支持在硅酸盐、氧化铝、二氧化钛或AIPO4上。这些催化剂在生产马来酸酐时的选择性通常低于非支持型催化剂，这给高选择性和转化率的实现带来了挑战。反应途径涉及C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体和2H-消除，需要精确控制催化剂结构和组成以实现高效催化。

2. 过程效率受到催化剂激活烷烃分子、促进期望反应路径以及减少非选择性转化的能力影响。要实现高选择性，往往需要精确控制催化剂的结构和组成。

3. 在制备过程中形成VOPO4而不是(VO)2P207导致产生非常小的晶粒VOPO4·H2O和I-VOPO4，这些物质具有与无支撑氧化物相似的催化性质。这表明支持型V-P-O催化剂选择性差可能是由于磷沉积在支撑材料上，导致部分范德华磷酸或范德华磷酸的不完全形成。

4. 如果在还原气氛中制备样品，可以预期生成细小晶粒的（VO）2P207，其催化性能与无支撑样本类似，从而可能提高氧化脱氢过程的选择性和效率。

[2] "Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."

[4] "The formation of VOPO4 instead of (VO)2P207 was a result of the preparation procedure."
[5] "Therefore, the poor selectivity for maleic anhydride reported in the literature for supported V-P-O catalysts probably is because some of the vanadium ions in those samples did not form vanadyl pyrophosphate or vanadyl phosphate due to deposition of some of the phosphorus on the support."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise from the difficulty in efficiently activating C-H bonds, generating M-alkyl intermediates, and performing 2H-abstraction reactions. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining reactive species to specific locations, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process. In the context of supported vanadium-phosphorus-oxygen catalysts, the selectivity to maleic anhydride production is often lower compared to unsupported catalysts. This is attributed to the deposition of phosphorus on the support, which prevents some vanadium ions from forming vanadyl pyrophosphate or vanadyl phosphate, thus affecting the catalytic properties and selectivity.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及催化剂间的复杂相互作用，包括单质金属氧化物和负载系统。在高效活化C-H键、生成M-烷基中间体以及进行2H-摘除反应方面存在挑战，这直接影响了转化率和选择性。通过隔离活性位点，可以提高过程效率并解决选择性问题。对于负载型钨磷氧催化剂而言，与非负载催化剂相比，其马来酸酐的选择性较低。这一现象归因于支持物上磷的沉积，阻止了一些钨离子形成钨磷酸或钨磷磷酸盐，从而影响催化特性和选择性。

在分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程中，文献强调了实现高选择性和转化率的挑战。各种催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和支撑系统，在此过程中发挥关键作用。影响过程效率的关键因素是激活C-H键的能力、生成M-烷基中间体以及执行2H-消除。通过使用磷改性的硅基负载范德华催化剂，实现了对选择性问题的隔离。具体来说，磷改性增强了马来酸酐的产率，归因于形成了非常小的晶粒VOPO4·H2O和I-VOPO4，这些物质具有与未支持氧化物相似的催化性能。氧比-丁烷比例的优化也影响了选择性，更氧化的环境导致了马来酸酐选择性的降低。拉曼光谱提供了关于反应期间催化剂结构变化的见解。

1. Introduction: "Alkanes are attractive alternative feedstocks for chemical synthesis. Compared to their aromatic counterparts, alkanes are both relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly."
2. Results and discussion: "The TEP impregnated 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 sample (VP0.0) evolved methanol, small amounts of TEP, and trace amounts of acetaldehyde when purged with helium in the reactor at room temperature."
3. Results and discussion: "Only a limited amount of phosphorus was retained by the catalysts in any one impregnation. In a series of experiments, sufficient TEP to produce samples with P : V ratios of 0.6, 1.0, and 2.0 was impregnated onto PV0.0. In every case the cata- lysts after calcination had P : V ratios of approximately 0.6."
4. Results and discussion: "Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly. Table 2 shows the product distributions for each sample at two butane conversions for reactions at 425 with 88/8/4 mixtures of He/O2/C4."
5. Results and discussion: "The effect of 02 : butane ratio in the feed was investigated with the PV2.8 sample. Under steady state conditions, a more oxidizing reaction mixture of 77/22/1 He/O2/C4 produced slightly lower activity and maleic anhydride selectivity, being 36.8%, than if the feed was an 88/8/4 He/O2/C4 mixture."
6. Results and discussion: "The activation energies for butane consumption on the phosphorus-modified catalysts also differed from that of PV0.0. They were calculated from data obtained between 400 and 450 at less than 8% butane conversion."
7. Results and discussion: "Changes in the samples could be observed with Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of the samples."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves considering various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the ability to control the reaction pathways effectively. High selectivity is crucial for efficient conversion, as it minimizes unwanted side reactions and maximizes the desired product yield. The proposed reaction mechanisms, including C-H bond activation, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, contribute to the process efficiency by facilitating the desired transformations while avoiding undesired byproducts.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues in supported catalysts. By confining reactive sites within the catalyst structure, the probability of direct contact between reactants and non-reactive sites decreases, thereby enhancing the selectivity towards the desired product. This approach ensures that the reaction occurs more efficiently, as it directs the reactivity towards the intended pathway rather than allowing it to proceed through alternative, less favorable routes.

In the context of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia catalysts, phosphorus modification enhances the yield of maleic anhydride in the partial oxidation of butane. Varying the phosphorus-to-vanadium atomic ratio increases the selectivity to maleic anhydride, with the selectivity nearly constant up to 20% butane conversion and for different O2/C4H10 ratios. The Raman spectra of the phosphorus-modified samples reveal the presence of VOPO4 and its hydrate, VOPO4.2H20, suggesting the formation of these compounds plays a key role in the enhanced selectivity for maleic anhydride production. The catalysts' properties, including their selectivity and activity, are influenced by factors such as the phosphorus-to-vanadium ratio, the preparation method, and the reaction conditions.

In summary, the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the ability to control reaction pathways are pivotal in achieving high selectivity and conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Site isolation techniques can enhance selectivity by directing reactivity towards the desired product, as demonstrated by the phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia catalysts. The formation of specific compounds, like VOPO4 and its hydrate, contributes to the improved selectivity for maleic anhydride production in these systems.

氧化脱氢反应（ODH）的分析涉及考虑各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化的挑战通常源于催化剂组成、反应条件以及有效控制反应途径的能力。高选择性对于提高效率至关重要，因为它最小化了副反应，并最大化了所需产物的产率。提出的反应机制，包括C-H键激活、形成金属-烷基中间体和2H-摘除，通过促进所需转变并避免非期望的副产物来增强过程效率。

位点隔离在解决支持催化剂的选择性问题中起着重要作用。通过将活性位点限制在催化剂结构内，直接接触反应物与非活性位点的概率降低，从而提高对所需产品的选择性。这种方法确保反应更高效地进行，因为它将反应导向预期路径而非允许其通过不太有利的路径进行。

在磷改性的硅基负载钒催化剂的背景下，磷改性提高了正丁烷部分氧化制备马来酸酐的产率。通过改变磷与钒的原子比，选择性增加了48%，与未改性的催化剂相比。选择性几乎在20%正丁烷转化率和不同的O2/C4H10比例下保持不变。磷改性的样品的拉曼光谱揭示了VOPO4及其水合物的存在，表明这些化合物的形成对马来酸酐生产的选择性增强起到了关键作用。催化剂的性质，如选择性、活性等，受磷与钒的比例、制备方法和反应条件等因素的影响。

综上所述，在氧化脱氢正烷烃的过程中，催化剂组成、反应条件以及有效控制反应途径的能力是实现高选择性和转化的关键因素。通过位点隔离技术可以增强选择性，因为它将反应导向预期的产品。VOPO4及其水合物的形成有助于这些系统中马来酸酐生产选择性提高。
