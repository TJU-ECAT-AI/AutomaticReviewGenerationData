Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include balancing reaction rate and product specificity, which are affected by factors like catalyst composition, operating conditions, and oxygen availability. Proposed reaction mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is crucial for addressing selectivity issues by preventing unwanted side reactions and ensuring the formation of desired products. Efficiency is influenced by the interplay between catalyst activity, selectivity, and the ability to control the reaction pathway.
