[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction."
[2] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
[3] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
[4] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
[5] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
[6] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
[7] "An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."
[8] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."
[9] "Several catalysts can be used, including the well-known ammoxidation catalyst MoBiOx, but more complex systems have been developed involving multicomponent oxides based on MoVNbTaSbTe...."
[10] "Bulk Metal Halides It is noteworthy that bulk metal halides and, in particular, LaCl3 catalyze several processes involving CH bond activation..."
[11] "Dehydrogenation of Alkanes The CATOFIN process, which is used to produce propene and isobutene from the corresponding alkanes, is performed with catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on alumina."
[12] "Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a)."
[13] "However, other active species such as small chromium oxide clusters are likely participating in the overall process."
[14] "These types of catalysts can also be used to catalytically convert methane into oxygenates, e.g. formaldehyde, in the presence of O2 or N2O, albeit with a low yield (25%; high selectivity only obtained at low conversions): VOx, (145-147) MoOx, (148-150) WOx, (151) as well as FeOx."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is crucial, facing challenges due to the ease of alkene oxidation compared to the alkane itself, requiring low conversion rates for high selectivity. Various bulk metal oxides can be used, but supported systems offer higher activity and selectivity.
2. C-H bond activation is the rate-determining step in ODH, especially for ethane, necessitating high temperatures above 600°C. A proposed mechanism involves the formation of alkyl intermediates, which decompose through β-H abstraction by a surface oxygen atom.
3. Alternative 2H-abstraction mechanisms are analogous to selective oxidation on VPO catalysts, aiming for efficient dehydrogenation while avoiding excessive overoxidation products.
4. Site isolation plays a significant role in enhancing selectivity during ODH and other alkane transformations, addressing the issue of competing pathways for product formation.
5. Multicomponent oxides based on elements like Mo, V, Nb, Ta, Sb, Te demonstrate improved activity and selectivity in ODH and related reactions, incorporating site isolation strategies.
6. Bulk metal halides, exemplified by LaCl3, catalyze CH bond activation in selective methane chlorination, showing distinct pathways compared to radical chain reactions.
7. Supported chromium oxide catalysts used in the CATOFIN process enable efficient alkane dehydrogenation, with isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment as the active site.
8. Small chromium oxide clusters may also contribute to the overall dehydrogenation process, enhancing catalyst performance beyond isolated sites.
9. Catalysts like MoBiOx, MoOx, WOx, and FeOx are utilized for converting methane into oxygenates, albeit with low yields and high selectivity achieved at low conversions.
