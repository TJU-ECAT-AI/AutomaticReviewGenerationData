[1] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
[2] "In all these processes, propene, whether the reactant or generated in situ, is converted via a CH bond activation involving a H-abstraction to generate a stabilized propenyl radical (Scheme 7)."
[3] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."
[4] "The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, (138, 139) to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species."
[5] "While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. CH bond activation."
[6] "DFT calculations on cluster models clearly show that the lowest energy barrier is usually associated with the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species (anti better than syn) with Cr (20.0 kcal mol1) < V (35.5 kcal mol1) < Mo (45.0 kcal mol1) < W (56.8 kcal mol1)."

1. Achieving high selectivity and conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is challenging due to the ease of alkene oxidation compared to the starting alkane. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity.

2. Propene, acting as a reactant or generated in situ, undergoes conversion through a CH bond activation involving H-abstraction, leading to the formation of a stabilized propenyl radical.

3. The efficiency of ODH processes is influenced by the spatial arrangement of active sites on catalyst surfaces, highlighting the importance of site isolation in overcoming selectivity issues.

4. The proposed mechanism for alkane dehydrogenation involves CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, resulting in the formation of a Cr-alkyl intermediate that decomposes via β-H transfer to produce the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species.

5. Despite producing vastly different products, reactions involving the oxidative dehydrogenation and selective oxidation of alkanes share common reaction intermediates and a rate-determining step: CH bond activation.

6. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species offers the lowest energy barrier, with Cr, V, Mo, and W showing decreasing barriers in that order.

1. 在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，实现高选择性和转化率面临挑战，因为产物烯烃的氧化通常比起始烷烃更容易。位点隔离对于提高选择性至关重要。

2. 不论作为反应物还是原位生成，丙烯通过CH键活化涉及H抽象，生成稳定化的丙烯基自由基。

3. 通过空间排列活性位点的催化表面，影响ODH过程的效率，强调了位点隔离在克服选择性问题中的重要性。

4. 烷烃脱氢的提议机制包括在CrOS键上的CH键活化，形成Cr-烷基中间体，通过β-H转移分解形成烯烃和CrIIIH表面物种。

5. 尽管产生截然不同的产物，涉及氧化脱氢和烷烃选择性氧化的反应共享共同的反应中间体和速率决定步骤：CH键活化。

6. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示了在终端氧物种上的H抽象过程具有最低的能量壁垒，Cr、V、Mo和W按照此顺序显示出递减的壁垒。
