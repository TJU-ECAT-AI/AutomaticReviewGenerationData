[1] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
[2] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6)."
[3] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."
[4] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
[5] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
[6] "This process involves propene as a key intermediate, and the subsequent elementary steps are those of propene ammoxidation."
[7] "Several catalysts can be used, including the well-known ammoxidation catalyst MoBiOx, but more complex systems have been developed involving multicomponent oxides based on MoVNbTaSbTe...."
[8] "While Malkyl intermediates might be formed at lower temperatures, (120) the key step of this reaction is a H-abstraction, the formation of radical intermediates, and subsequent gas phase reactions."
[9] "We will discuss in a first part the dehydrogenation of alkanes and then in a second part both the oxidative dehydrogenation and selective oxidation of alkanes into oxygenates, because they have common reaction intermediates."
[10] "Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a)."
[11] "These types of catalysts can also be used to catalytically convert methane into oxygenates, e.g. formaldehyde, in the presence of O2 or N2O, albeit with a low yield (25%; high selectivity only obtained at low conversions): VOx, (145-147) MoOx, (148-150) WOx, (151) as well as FeOx. (152-154)"
[12] "DFT calculations on cluster models clearly show that the lowest energy barrier is usually associated with the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species (anti better than syn) with Cr (20.0 kcal mol1) < V (35.5 kcal mol1) < Mo (45.0 kcal mol1) < W (56.8 kcal mol1)."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it's evident that various catalysts, both bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in enhancing process efficiency. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are intertwined with the nature of the catalysts and their ability to facilitate specific reaction pathways. Key factors influencing process efficiency include the identification of active sites, the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues, and the understanding of common reaction intermediates across different reactions.

Catalysts such as VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx, when supported on oxide materials, exhibit promising activity in both ODH and selective oxidation of alkanes into oxygenates. These systems often feature isolated sites or small clusters at low surface coverage, facilitating the activation of the C-H bond, which is the rate-determining step in these reactions. The activation process can involve a variety of mechanisms, including H-abstraction, the formation of alkyl or hydride intermediates, and the insertion of the CH bond across metal-oxygen bonds. 

DFT calculations indicate that the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species is energetically favorable, with chromium being the most efficient among the metals considered. This process contributes to the formation of alkyl radicals, which can further participate in subsequent reactions, such as gas-phase reactions or the formation of alkene products. The selectivity and yield of these reactions are influenced by the distance between active sites, suggesting the importance of site isolation to prevent unwanted side reactions and enhance product purity.

In summary, the effectiveness of ODH processes is contingent upon the precise manipulation of catalyst properties, including the nature of active sites, the selectivity of C-H bond activation, and the control of reaction pathways to achieve high conversion and selectivity while minimizing overoxidation products.

氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）分析中，各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，在提高过程效率方面起着关键作用。在实现高选择性和转化率时遇到的挑战与催化剂的性质以及其促进特定反应路径的能力紧密相关。影响过程效率的关键因素包括确定活性位点、通过隔离位点解决选择性问题的重要性，以及不同反应中共同中间体的理解。

如VOx、NbOx、CrOx、MoOx和WOx等催化剂，当以氧化物材料为载体时，在ODH和选择性氧化烷烃生成氧化物的过程中表现出有前景的活性。这些系统通常具有低表面覆盖率下的孤立位点或小型簇，这有助于激活C-H键，这是这些反应的速率决定步骤。激活过程可以涉及多种机制，包括H抽取、形成烷基或氢中间体，以及金属-氧键上的CH键插入。

DFT计算表明，对终端氧物种进行H抽取过程在能量上是可取的，其中铬是最有效的金属之一。这一过程有助于形成烷基自由基，这些自由基可以进一步参与后续反应，如气相反应或生成烯烃产品。这些反应的选择性和产率受到活性位点间距离的影响，这表明隔离活性位点对于防止非希望的副反应并提高产品质量的重要性。

综上所述，ODH过程的有效性取决于精确控制催化剂属性，包括活性位点的性质、C-H键活化的选择性和反应途径的控制，以实现高转化率和选择性，同时减少过氧化产物的生成。
