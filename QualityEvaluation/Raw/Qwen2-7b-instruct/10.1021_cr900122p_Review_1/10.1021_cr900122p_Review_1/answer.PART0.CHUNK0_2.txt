[1] "One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
[2] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass."
[3] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."
[4] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."
[5] "Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant."
[6] "It is possible to increase the yield of alkane dehydrogenation using molecular oxygen as coreactant to displace the thermodynamic equilibrium by oxidation of coproduct H2 into H2O."
[7] "However, despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx)."
[8] "These types of catalysts can also be used to catalytically convert methane into oxygenates, e.g. formaldehyde, in the presence of O2 or N2O, albeit with a low yield (25%; high selectivity only obtained at low conversions): VOx, MoOx, WOx, as well as FeOx."
[9] "While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. CH bond activation."
[10] "Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the CH bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges arise due to the ease of alkene oxidation compared to alkane oxidation, necessitating low conversion rates to avoid overoxidation products. Site isolation is essential for maintaining selectivity, as the distance between active sites affects the reaction outcomes. High temperatures are required for efficient ODH processes, especially for ethane, where gas phase reactions predominate. Increasing the yield through the displacement of the thermodynamic equilibrium by oxidizing coproduct H2 into H2O can be achieved, though the yields remain limited. Using molecular oxygen as a coreactant enables the conversion of methane into oxygenates, such as formaldehyde, with VOx, MoOx, WOx, and FeOx catalysts. Despite leading to diverse products, these reactions share common reaction intermediates and a rate-determining step of C-H bond activation. The structure of active sites influences the proposed reaction pathways, contributing to ongoing debates about the mechanisms involved in ODH and selective oxidation processes.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），不同催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，对实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。由于烯烃的氧化比烷烃更容易（更快），因此需要较低的转化率来避免过氧化产物，这构成了挑战。位点隔离对于保持选择性至关重要，因为活性位点之间的距离影响反应结果。对于乙烯而言，需要较高的温度才能有效地进行ODH过程。通过氧化副产物H2生成H2O来移除热力学平衡，可以提高产率，尽管产率仍然有限。使用分子氧作为核心反应剂可以实现甲烷转化为氧气化物，如甲醛，使用VOx、MoOx、WOx和FeOx催化剂。尽管导致不同的产品，但这些反应共享共同的反应中间体和速率决定步骤，即C-H键活化。活性位点结构影响提出的反应途径，从而引发了关于ODH和选择性氧化过程中涉及机制的持续争论。
