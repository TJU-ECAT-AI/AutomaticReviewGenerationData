          [1] "The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increased with increasing Cr content, and content of the support, and a maximal conversion was reached after 515 min on-stream."
          [2] "The initial reduction of Cr6 after exposing the catalyst to n-butane was responsible for the formation of and CO/CO2 cracking products and (C1, C2 C3)."
          [3] "The dehydrogenation activity was proportional to the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction."
          [4] "Although the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2 species cannot be ruled out, it seems that Cr3 was more active than Cr2."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the intricate reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by providing a controlled environment for the desired reactions to occur, minimizing unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors like the type of catalyst, its loading, and the support material. For instance, the dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increases with increasing chromium content and support content, reaching a maximum after a certain period of operation. This highlights the importance of optimizing these parameters to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The initial reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) is critical in initiating the dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the formation of cracking products and selectively producing alkenes. The direct correlation between the amount of chromium(III) formed upon reduction of chromium(VI) and catalytic activity suggests that chromium(III) is the active species involved in the dehydrogenation process.

          在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，各种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）之间存在复杂的相互作用。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战往往源自复杂的反应机制，如C-H键活化、形成M-烷基中间体以及2H摘除。通过提供一个受控环境来促进所需反应的发生，最小化非期望的副反应，位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。该过程的效率受到催化剂类型、负载量和支持材料的影响。例如，支持的铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢活性随铬含量和支撑物含量的增加而增加，并在特定操作时间后达到最大值。这强调了优化这些参数以实现最佳催化性能的重要性。催化剂暴露于正丁烷流中的初始还原铬（VI）到铬（III）是启动脱氢反应的关键步骤，导致裂解产物的形成并选择性地生成烯烃。直接将还原成铬（VI）的铬（III）的数量与催化活性相关联表明，铬（III）是参与脱氢过程的活性物种。

          [1] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and and cracking products and are formed."
          [2] "After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene were produced selectively."
          [3] "The dehydrogenation activity increased almost linearly with increasing Cr loading."
          [4] "The deviation from linearity at higher Cr loadings must be due to the inherent limitations of the Kubelka-Munk theory."
          [5] "The almost linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, as measured by in situ DRS spectroscopy, indicates that Cr3 is the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Our experiments clearly show that Cr6 was instantly reduced to Cr3@2 after exposing the catalyst to a stream of n-butane."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process involves multiple factors influencing its efficiency. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play significant roles. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the complexity of the reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is crucial for enhancing selectivity, as it helps in controlling the reaction pathways and product distribution.

          The role of supported chromium oxide catalysts in ODH is pivotal, as they are key in the production of essential commodity chemicals. These catalysts' activity and performance are closely tied to their molecular structure and interactions within the reaction environment. The study of supported chromium oxide catalysts in ODH reactions, particularly through in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopy, aids in understanding the role of different chromium species (Cr6, Cr3, and Cr2) in the catalytic process.

          As the Cr content and support composition increase, the catalytic activity of the supported chromium oxide catalysts also increases, reaching a peak after 515 minutes of operation. It is observed that the Cr3 species, formed upon the reduction of Cr6, are more active than the Cr2 species in the ODH process. The initial reduction of Cr6 leads to the formation of cracking products and CO/CO2, contributing to the conversion of alkanes.

          Collectively, these factors—catalyst type, Cr content, support composition, and the activity of chromium species—significantly impact the process efficiency of ODH. Addressing selectivity issues through site isolation strategies can optimize the conversion and yield of desired products, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the ODH process.

          在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，多个因素共同影响其效率。包括块体金属氧化物和支撑系统在内的各种催化剂在其中扮演重要角色。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战主要来源于反应机制的复杂性，如C-H键活化、形成M-烷基中间体以及2H摘除。通过提供一个受控环境来促进所需反应的发生，最小化非期望的副反应，位点隔离对于提高选择性至关重要，它有助于控制反应途径和产物分布。

          在ODH过程中，支持的铬氧化物催化剂的作用至关重要，因为它们是生产重要商品化学品的关键。这些催化剂的活性和性能与其分子结构及其与反应环境的相互作用密切相关。通过原位紫外可见扩散反射光谱研究支持型铬氧化物催化剂在ODH反应中的作用，有助于理解不同铬物种（Cr6、Cr3和Cr2）在催化过程中的角色。

          随着铬含量和支撑物组成的增加，支持型铬氧化物催化剂的催化活性也相应增加，在连续运行515分钟后达到峰值。观察到，在ODH过程中，形成于Cr6还原后的Cr3物种比Cr2物种更为活跃。初始的Cr6还原导致裂解产物和CO/CO2的形成，从而促进烷烃的转化。

          总体而言，催化剂类型、铬含量、支撑物组成以及铬物种的活性等因素显著影响ODH过程的效率。通过位点隔离策略解决选择性问题可以优化期望产品的转化和产量，从而增强ODH过程的整体有效性。
