[1] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which and some cracking products CO/CO2 are formed."
[2] "After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene were produced selectively."
[3] "The dehydrogenation activity increased almost linearly with increasing Cr loading."
[4] "The deviation from linearity at higher Cr loadings must be due to the inherent limitations of the Kubelka-Munk theory."
[5] "The almost linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, as measured by in situ DRS spectroscopy, indicates that Cr3 is the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation."
[6] "Our experiments clearly show that Cr6 was instantly reduced to Cr3@2 after exposing the catalyst to a stream of n-butane."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the intricate reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by providing a controlled environment for the desired reactions to occur, minimizing unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors like the type of catalyst, its loading, and the support material. For instance, the dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increases with increasing chromium content and support content, reaching a maximum after a certain period of operation. This highlights the importance of optimizing these parameters to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The initial reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) is critical in initiating the dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the formation of cracking products and selectively producing alkenes. The direct correlation between the amount of chromium(III) formed upon reduction of chromium(VI) and catalytic activity suggests that chromium(III) is the active species involved in the dehydrogenation process.

氧化脱烷烃（ODH）涉及复杂催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通常源自复杂的反应机制，如C-H键活化、形成M-烷基中间体以及2H摘除。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过提供一个受控环境来促进所需反应的发生，最小化非期望的副反应。该过程的效率受到催化剂类型、负载量和支持材料的影响。例如，支持的铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢活性随铬含量和支撑物含量的增加而增加，并在特定操作时间后达到最大值。这强调了优化这些参数以实现最佳催化性能的重要性。催化剂暴露于正丁烷流中的初始还原铬（VI）到铬（III）是启动脱氢反应的关键步骤，导致裂解产物的形成并选择性地生成烯烃。直接将还原成铬（VI）的铬（III）的数量与催化活性相关联表明，铬（III）是参与脱氢过程的活性物种。
