[1] "The industrial importance of supported chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research towards the elucidation of the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relation with catalytic performances."
[2] "Indeed, several large volume industrial processes rely on supported chromium oxides as a heterogeneous catalyst."
[3] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and and cracking products and are formed."
[4] "After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene are produced with a selectivity up to 90%."
[5] "The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increased with increasing Cr content, and content of the support, and a maximal conversion was reached after 515 min on-stream."
[6] "The dehydrogenation activity was proportional to the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction."
[7] "Although the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2 species cannot be ruled out, it seems that Cr3 was more active than Cr2."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through understanding the interplay between catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms. Key factors influencing process efficiency include C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a critical role in enhancing selectivity by controlling the location and reactivity of active sites on the catalyst surface. As evidenced by the literature, the activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts is positively correlated with the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, indicating that Cr3 species are the active sites for ODH. This insight underscores the importance of site isolation in optimizing catalyst performance for ODH reactions.

氧化脱氢反应（ODH）过程利用各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃。在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临的挑战通过理解催化剂特性和反应机制之间的相互作用来解决。影响过程效率的关键因素包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H摘除。位点隔离在提高选择性方面起着关键作用，通过控制催化剂表面活性位点的位置和活性来增强选择性。文献表明，支持型铬氧化物催化剂的活性与Cr6还原后形成的Cr3量成正比，这表明Cr3物种是ODH反应的活性位点。这一见解强调了在优化ODH反应催化剂性能时位点隔离的重要性。
