[1] "Mechanistic aspects of dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica have been studied by means of quantum chemistry."
[2] "A reaction mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis,accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds,(2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."
[3] "Regeneration of the catalytic cite according to reaction (3) requires the initial CH activation step to involve a CrO ester linkage to the surface."
[4] "On DeRossi-type species, the water molecule formed in reaction (1) is likely to desorb, thus making reformation of the CrO bond less likely."
[5] "On chromium species with three CrO ester linkages to the surface, a silanol moiety, rather than water, is made in the initial CH/ CrO activation."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves examining the role of catalysts, particularly focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include managing the reaction pathways to ensure efficient and targeted transformation of alkanes into olefins without unwanted side reactions. The proposed reaction mechanisms often involve the activation of C-H bonds, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by the catalyst's ability to selectively promote desired reactions while minimizing energy consumption and waste generation. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the active sites are well-defined and isolated from other reactive components, thus enhancing the specificity of the catalytic process.

氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）分析涉及催化剂的作用，特别是关注基态金属氧化物和支持系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括管理反应途径，以确保有效且有针对性地将烷烃转化为烯烃，同时避免不必要的副反应。通常提出的反应机制涉及到C-H键的活化、形成金属-烷基中间体以及2H-摘除。这些过程的效率受到催化剂促进所需反应的能力的影响，同时尽量减少能量消耗和废物产生。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过确保活性位点被明确定义并与其他反应性成分隔离，从而增强催化过程的特异性。
