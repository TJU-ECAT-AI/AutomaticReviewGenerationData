[1] "Dehydrogenation has become an increasingly topical method for chemical upgrading of liquid natural gas.1,2 Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed, and some 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins are anually produced this way.2 Finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium2,3 appear as the most interesting catalysts from an industrial point of view. Chromium shows interesting catalytic activity on alumina, which was the original4 and still is the most commonly used support, but also on silica,zirconia and titania.3 Specific aspects of the preparation of the catalyst affect the activity of chromium in these systems."

[2] "Concerning the dispersion of active chromium, below mono-layer coverage and on both alumina, silica and zirconia, a linear relationship is found between the number of mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after cal- cination, and catalytic activity after reduction.13,2629 On this basis, DeRossi and co-workers13,26,27 concluded that the reaction requires only mononuclear chromium species."

[3] "A recurrent idea is that CH activation could involve a CrO pair.3,13,26,36,37 In agreement with the conclusions of DeRossi and co- workers concerning the activity of mononuclear chro- mium species,13,26,27 Burwell et al.37 and later Weckhuy- sen and Schoonheydt3 proposed that dehydrogenation is initiated by physisorption of the alkane on coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) centers."

[4] "A reaction mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis,accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds,(2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."

[5] "Based on the computed energies, an alternative me- chanism is formulated in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in reaction (2) (above), rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands. Key features of this mechanism are the formation of HH and CrC bonds by means of -bond metathesis and that CH activation becomes rate determining."

[6] "It is conceivable that both mechanisms are at work in active catalysts. The presence of traces of moisture in the feed will terminate the hydride-based mechanism."

1. Various catalytic systems, including homogeneous and heterogeneous ones, have been developed for the chemical upgrading of liquid natural gas. Chromium, often supported on alumina, silica, zirconia, or titania, shows interesting catalytic activity.

2. A linear relationship exists between the number of mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after calcination and the catalytic activity after reduction on alumina, silica, and zirconia. DeRossi and colleagues concluded that the reaction requires only mononuclear chromium species.

3. Dehydrogenation can involve a CrO pair, and Burwell et al. and Weckhuyzen and Schoonheydt proposed that dehydrogenation is initiated by physisorption of the alkane on coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) centers.

4. A viable reaction mechanism for dehydrogenation of ethane includes CH activation by -bond metathesis, followed by -H transfer to chromium, and regeneration of the chromium site through -bond metathesis.

5. An alternative mechanism involves CH activation at a reactive hydridochromium complex, which forms HH and CrC bonds by -bond metathesis. This mechanism makes CH activation rate determining.

6. Both mechanisms can coexist in active catalysts. The presence of moisture in the feed can terminate the hydride-based mechanism.

1. 各种催化系统，包括均相和非均相系统，已经开发用于液化天然气的化学升级。铬，常被支持在氧化铝、二氧化硅、锆石或钛酸盐上，显示出有趣的催化活性。

2. 在氧化铝、二氧化硅和锆石上，煅烧后单核Cr(VI)/Cr(V)物种的数量与还原后的催化活性之间存在线性关系。德罗斯西及其同事得出结论，反应只需要单核铬物种。

3. 脱氢可能涉及CrO对，并且Burwell等和韦克休森和舒恩海特提出，脱氢是由烷烃在配位不饱和Cr(III)中心的物理吸附开始的。

4. 一种可行的脱氢机制包括通过-键异构化激活乙烷，随后是氢原子转移到铬并释放乙烯，以及通过-键异构化再生铬位点。

5. 另一个机制涉及在反应（2）中形成的反应性氢化铬复合物的CH激活，形成HH和CrC键并通过-键异构化。这种机制使CH激活成为决定性的步骤。

6. 这两个机制可以在活性催化剂中同时工作。在原料中存在微量水分可以终止基于氢的机制。
