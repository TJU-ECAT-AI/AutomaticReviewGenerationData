[1] "Mechanistic aspects of dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica have been studied by means of quantum chemistry."
[2] "A reaction mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis,accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds,(2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."
[3] "Regeneration of the catalytic cite according to reaction (3) requires the initial CH activation step to involve a CrO ester linkage to the surface."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are influenced by the interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. The proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific sites on the catalyst, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process.

The key steps in the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica catalysts involve:
1. Activation of the C-H bond by -bond metathesis, accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds.
2. Transfer of a hydrogen atom from the alkyl to chromium, leading to the release of ethene.
3. Regeneration of the chromium site through -bond metathesis, releasing hydrogen gas.

Regeneration of the catalyst site requires the initial activation step to involve a CrO ester linkage to the surface. This ensures the stability of the catalyst and prevents the formation of more stable species. On DeRossi-type species, the water molecule formed during the initial activation step is likely to desorb, facilitating the reformation of the CrO bond and maintaining the catalytic activity.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及包括体金属氧化物和负载系统在内的多种催化剂。在实现高选择性和转化率时，催化剂性质、反应机制和工艺条件之间的相互作用带来了挑战。提出的反应机制包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H抽象。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过将反应限制在催化剂上的特定位点，从而提高过程的效率。

脱氢乙烷在Cr(III)二氧化硅单核催化剂上的关键步骤包括：
1. 通过σ键重排活化C-H键，伴随形成OH和CrC键。
2. 从烷基到铬转移一个氢原子，导致乙烯的释放。
3. 通过σ键重排再生铬中心，释放氢气。

根据再生步骤的要求，初始激活步骤需要涉及表面的CrO酯连接。这确保了催化剂的稳定性，并阻止形成更稳定的物种。在DeRossi类型物种上，初始激活步骤中形成的水分子很可能会脱附，促进CrO键的再生，保持催化活性。
