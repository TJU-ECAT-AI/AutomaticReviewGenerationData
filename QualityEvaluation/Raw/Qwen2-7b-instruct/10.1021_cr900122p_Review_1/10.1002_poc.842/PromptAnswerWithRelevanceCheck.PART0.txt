The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by multiple factors, including the nature of catalysts and the reaction mechanisms involved. The interplay between bulk metal oxides and supported systems is significant in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts, particularly chromium (Cr) oxides supported on silica or alumina, have been studied for their effectiveness in ODH. 

The role of Cr(II) and Cr(III) species as active states for dehydrogenation is debated, with evidence supporting both oxidation states. The dispersion of active chromium, typically below monolayer coverage, shows a linear relationship with the number of mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after calcination, indicating its importance in catalytic activity. Redox Cr(III) species, derived from reduction processes, are likely to play a crucial role in dehydrogenation, suggesting the involvement of Cr(III) in active sites.

Despite the existence of Cr-based catalysts, detailed understanding of dehydrogenation mechanisms, especially on silica and alumina surfaces, remains limited. Theoretical modeling suggests that CH activation could occur through oxidative addition or -bond metathesis, involving a CrO pair or M-alkyl intermediates. Site isolation, which refers to the spatial arrangement of active sites on the catalyst, influences selectivity by affecting the accessibility of reactants and products. High selectivity can be achieved by isolating active sites, which minimizes unwanted side reactions and enhances the efficiency of the process.

In summary, the effectiveness of ODH catalysts depends on the interplay between the nature of the catalyst, the specific mechanisms involved, and the optimization of site isolation to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Theoretical modeling complements experimental studies by providing insights into the potential pathways and optimizing the design of catalysts for improved performance.

氧化脱氢化（ODH）是烷烃脱氢的一个复杂过程，受多种因素影响，包括催化剂的性质和反应机制。不同类型的催化剂，特别是铬（Cr）氧化物支持在硅或氧化铝上的催化剂，在实现高选择性和转化率方面起着关键作用。

Cr(II)和Cr(III)物种作为脱氢活性状态的争论，有证据支持这两种氧化状态。在催化活性上，单核Cr(VI)/Cr(V)物种的数量与煅烧后的线性关系，表明Cr的分散状态的重要性。还原Cr(III)物种，即通过还原Cr(VI)/Cr(V)得到的物种，被认为是脱氢的有效，表明Cr(III)可能在活性位点中发挥作用。

尽管存在Cr基催化剂，但关于脱氢机制的详细理解，尤其是对于硅和氧化铝表面的情况，仍然有限。理论模型表明，CH激活可以通过氧化添加或键断裂机制发生，涉及CrO对或M-烷基中间体。位点隔离，指的是催化剂上活性位点的空间分布，影响选择性，因为它影响反应物和产物的可接近性。通过优化位点隔离来实现高选择性和转化率可以提高过程效率。

综上所述，ODH催化剂的有效性取决于催化剂的性质、特定机制的相互作用以及通过优化位点隔离实现高选择性和转化率的能力。理论模型补充了实验研究，提供了潜在路径的见解，并优化了催化剂设计以提高性能。

[1] "Dehydrogenation has become an increasingly topical method for chemical upgrading of liquid natural gas.1,2 Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed, and some 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins are anually produced this way.2 Finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium2,3 appear as the most interesting catalysts from an industrial point of view. Chromium shows interesting catalytic activity on alumina, which was the original4 and still is the most commonly used support, but also on silica,zirconia and titania.3 Specific aspects of the preparation of the catalyst affect the activity of chromium in these systems."

[3] "Regeneration of the catalytic cite according to reaction (3) requires the initial CH activation step to involve a CrO ester linkage to the surface. Based on free-energy calculations, the second reaction step, involving -hydrogen transfer to the metal,is found to be rate determining. Activation free energy and enthalpy are computed in excess of 300 and 200 kJ mol1, respectively."

1. The dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica has been studied using quantum chemistry. Various cluster models have been created based on the concept of Cr(III) with three covalent ligands coordinating through oxygen. These models offer consistent reaction energy profiles for key steps.

2. A feasible reaction pathway involving three steps has been identified: activation of the C-H bond through metathesis, hydrogen transfer to the metal, and regeneration of the catalyst site through metathesis. The second step, hydrogen transfer, is found to be the rate-limiting process.

3. For the catalyst to regenerate, the first step of C-H activation needs to involve a Cr-O ester bond. Calculations show that the hydrogen transfer step is rate-determining, with activation energies exceeding 300 kJ/mol.

4. An alternative mechanism proposes that C-H activation occurs at a reactive hydride complex formed in the second step, leading to formation of hydrogen-hydrogen and Cr-C bonds via metathesis. This mechanism has a lower activation enthalpy of around 70 kJ/mol compared to previous models.

5. Moisture in the feed will halt the hydride-based reaction mechanism.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are influenced by the interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. The proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific sites on the catalyst, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process.

The key steps in the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica catalysts involve:
1. Activation of the C-H bond by -bond metathesis, accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds.
2. Transfer of a hydrogen atom from the alkyl to chromium, leading to the release of ethene.
3. Regeneration of the chromium site through -bond metathesis, releasing hydrogen gas.

Regeneration of the catalyst site requires the initial activation step to involve a CrO ester linkage to the surface. This ensures the stability of the catalyst and prevents the formation of more stable species. On DeRossi-type species, the water molecule formed during the initial activation step is likely to desorb, facilitating the reformation of the CrO bond and maintaining the catalytic activity.

脱氢乙烷在Cr(III)二氧化硅单核催化剂上的关键步骤包括：
1. 通过σ键重排活化C-H键，伴随形成OH和CrC键。
2. 从烷基到铬转移一个氢原子，导致乙烯的释放。
3. 通过σ键重排再生铬中心，释放氢气。

根据再生步骤的要求，初始激活步骤需要涉及表面的CrO酯连接。这确保了催化剂的稳定性，并阻止形成更稳定的物种。在DeRossi类型物种上，初始激活步骤中形成的水分子很可能会脱附，促进CrO键的再生，保持催化活性。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves examining the role of catalysts, particularly focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include managing the reaction pathways to ensure efficient and targeted transformation of alkanes into olefins without unwanted side reactions. The proposed reaction mechanisms often involve the activation of C-H bonds, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by the catalyst's ability to selectively promote desired reactions while minimizing energy consumption and waste generation. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the active sites are well-defined and isolated from other reactive components, thus enhancing the specificity of the catalytic process.
