[1] "Exploratory goals include the search for new types of C-H activating systems."
[2] "We also anticipate the appearance of new ligands that will convert nonreactive metals into reactive ones, allow conversion of C-H-activated products into functionalized organic compounds (e.g.,oxidation-resistant ligands), and provide methods for carrying out enantioselective C-H activation."
[3] "Within this general goal lie methods for selective conversion of C-H activated metal complexes to functional groups of choice and conversion of methane to longer-chain hydrocarbons for use as synthetic intermediates or liquid fuels."

The future of C-H activation research aims to explore and develop new types of activating systems for C-H bonds. Researchers anticipate finding new ligands that can transform inert metals into reactive catalysts, facilitate the conversion of C-H activated products into functionalized organic compounds, particularly those resistant to oxidation. Moreover, they seek methods to enable enantioselective C-H activation, aiming for selective transformations of C-H activated complexes into desired functional groups. Additionally, they are working towards strategies for converting methane and other hydrocarbons into longer-chain hydrocarbons, useful as synthetic intermediates or liquid fuels.
