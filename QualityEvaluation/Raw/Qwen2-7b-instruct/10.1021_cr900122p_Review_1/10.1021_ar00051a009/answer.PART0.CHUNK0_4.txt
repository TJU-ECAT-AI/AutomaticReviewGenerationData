[1] "The bulk metal oxide catalysts and supported systems play crucial roles in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. These catalysts are capable of activating C-H bonds, forming M-alkyl intermediates, and facilitating 2H-abstraction."
[2] "Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH include the risk of unwanted side reactions, such as the formation of alkenes and alcohols."
[3] "Efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by factors like catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the nature of the alkane feedstock."
[4] "Site isolation techniques aim to enhance selectivity by preventing unwanted reactions and promoting the desired C-H bond cleavage."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems are essential components. They enable the activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and facilitate the 2H-abstraction process. High selectivity and conversion challenges stem from potential side reactions like the formation of alkenes and alcohols. The efficiency of the ODH process is shaped by factors including catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the characteristics of the alkane feedstock. Site isolation strategies are implemented to improve selectivity by minimizing unwanted reactions and promoting targeted C-H bond cleavage.
