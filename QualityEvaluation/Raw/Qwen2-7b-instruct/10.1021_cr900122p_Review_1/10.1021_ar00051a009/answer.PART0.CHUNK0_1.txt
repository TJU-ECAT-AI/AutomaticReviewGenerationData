[1] "Although progress has been made on the develop- ment of catalytic alkane functionalization methods,the community still awaits the development of truly robust, high-yield, high-turnover catalysts for alkane functionalization that can be employed on a large scale."
[2] "We require better insight into why some metals undergo C-H activation and why some do not, and an improvement in the level of reliability associated with theoretical predictions of energy sur- faces for C-H activation, especially for relatively complex molecules."
[3] "Exploratory goals include the search for new types of C-H activating systems."
[4] "We also anticipate the appearance of new ligands that will convert nonreactive metals into reactive ones, allow conversion of C-H-activated products into functionalized organic compounds (e.g.,oxidation-resistant ligands), and provide methods for carrying out enantioselective C-H activation."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), several factors collectively influence the process efficiency, including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. The use of catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in driving the reaction towards the desired products. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed by optimizing the catalyst properties, such as particle size, surface area, and composition. Site isolation techniques are also employed to prevent unwanted side reactions, thereby enhancing the selectivity of the process.

Mechanistically, the process of ODH involves several steps, including C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. C-H bond activation is a critical step, where the metal catalyst facilitates the breaking of the alkane's C-H bond. Formation of metal-alkyl intermediates follows, which then undergoes further reactions to produce the final products. 2H-abstraction is another key step, where hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the alkane, contributing to the dehydrogenation.

Site isolation techniques involve separating the active sites of the catalyst from each other, which helps in preventing unwanted reactions and promoting the desired ODH reaction. This isolation can be achieved through the use of supports or by incorporating spacer groups in the catalyst structure. The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the balance between the rate of C-H bond activation, the stability of metal-alkyl intermediates, and the rate of 2H-abstraction.

New catalysts and ligands are being sought to improve the robustness, high yield, and high turnover of alkane functionalization methods. The development of catalysts that can operate on a large scale is a significant challenge in the field. Ligands that can convert nonreactive metals into reactive ones, facilitate the conversion of C-H-activated products into functionalized organic compounds, and enable enantioselective C-H activation are anticipated to play a pivotal role in advancing the field.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，几个因素共同影响其过程效率，包括催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化的挑战以及反应机制的提出。催化剂的使用，如多相金属氧化物和负载系统，在驱动反应向所需产物方向发展方面起着关键作用。通过优化催化剂的性质，如粒度、表面积和组成，可以解决实现高选择性和转化的挑战。隔离位点技术也被用来防止不必要的副反应，从而提高过程的选择性。

从机制上讲，ODH过程涉及几个步骤，包括C-H键活化、形成金属-烷基中间体和2H-摘除。C-H键活化是关键步骤，其中金属催化剂促进烷烃的C-H键断裂。随后是形成金属-烷基中间体，然后进行进一步反应以产生最终产品。2H-摘除是另一个关键步骤，其中从烷烃中摘除氢原子，从而促进脱氢。

隔离位点技术涉及将催化剂活性位点彼此分开，这有助于防止不必要的反应并促进所需的ODH反应。这可以通过使用支持物或在催化剂结构中引入间隔基团来实现。ODH过程的效率受到C-H键活化速率、金属-烷基中间体稳定性以及2H-摘除速率之间的平衡的影响。

正在寻求新的催化剂和配体来改进烷烃功能化方法的稳健性、高产率和高周转率。大规模操作的催化剂开发是该领域的一个重大挑战。能够操作在大规模上的催化剂预计将在该领域发挥关键作用。能够将非活性金属转化为活性物质、促进C-H活化产物转化为功能性有机化合物以及实现手性C-H活化的配体预计将在推进该领域方面发挥重要作用。
