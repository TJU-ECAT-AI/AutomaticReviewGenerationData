[1] "Exploratory goals include the search for new types of C-H activating systems. Waylands termolecular rhodium porphyrin reactions, our late transition metal Ir(II1) apparent a-bond metathesis reactions, and Perianas Hg(II)/CF3S03H systems are examples of new types of C-H activation reactions that have come to light relatively recently."
[2] "Although progress has been made on the develop-ment of catalytic alkane functionalization methods, the community still awaits the development of truly robust, high-yield, high-turnover catalysts for alkane functionalization that can be employed on a large scale."

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
