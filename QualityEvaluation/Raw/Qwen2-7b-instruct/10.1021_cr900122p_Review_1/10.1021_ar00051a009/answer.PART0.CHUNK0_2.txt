[1] "Exploratory goals include the search for new types of C-H activating systems. Waylands termolecular rhodium porphyrin reactions, our late transition metal Ir(II1) apparent a-bond metathesis reactions, and Perianas Hg(II)/CF3S03H systems are examples of new types of C-H activation reactions that have come to light relatively recently. We expect that the search for analogues of these reactions, as well as for completely new classes of C-H activation processes, will be fruitful."
[2] "Still perplexing is the relationship of heterogeneous and biological catalysts to those that can be prepared in the laboratory, as well as the challenge of synthesizing soluble complexes that will mimic the C-H activation behavior of their solid and biological relatives."
[3] "We also anticipate the appearance of new ligands that will convert nonreactive metals into reactive ones, allow conversion of C-H-activated products into functionalized organic compounds (e.g.,oxidation-resistant ligands), and provide methods for carrying out enantioselective C-H activation."
[4] "Within this general goal lie methods for selective conversion of C-H activated metal complexes to functional groups of choice and conversion of methane to longer-chain hydrocarbons for use as synthetic intermediates or liquid fuels."

The search for new types of C-H activating systems is an exploratory goal, including termolecular rhodium porphyrin reactions, late transition metal Ir(II1) apparent a-bond metathesis reactions, and Hg(II)/CF3S03H systems. The relationship between heterogeneous/biological catalysts and those in the lab, as well as the synthesis of soluble complexes that mimic the C-H activation behavior of solids and biology, are still unclear. New ligands are expected to convert nonreactive metals to reactive ones, facilitate conversion of C-H activated products into functionalized organic compounds, and enable enantioselective C-H activation. Methods for selective conversion of C-H activated metal complexes to functional groups and methane to longer-chain hydrocarbons for synthetic use are also sought.

探索新的C-H激活系统是目标之一，包括罗兹曼的分子间铑卟啉反应、晚期过渡金属Ir(II1)显现出的a键互换反应以及Hg(II)/CF3S03H系统。异相/生物催化剂与实验室中的催化剂之间的关系，以及合成模仿固体和生物体行为的可溶性复合物仍然不明朗。预计会出现新的配体，将非活性金属转化为活性金属，促进C-H活化产物转化为功能化有机化合物，并实现手性选择性的C-H活化。寻找选择性转化C-H活化金属复合物为所需功能基团的方法和甲烷转化为更长链烃类以作为中间体或液体燃料的目标也存在。
