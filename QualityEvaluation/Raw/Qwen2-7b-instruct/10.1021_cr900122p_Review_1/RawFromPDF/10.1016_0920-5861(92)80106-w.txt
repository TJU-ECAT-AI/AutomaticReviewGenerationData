Abstract 
The main aspects of the new reaction of direct (one-stage) propane ammoxidation to 
acrylonitrile (ACN) are analyzed with reference to the development of the catalysts for this 
reaction, the main technological options for the process and relationship with reaction 
conditions, the reaction network and kinetics of the reaction. In particular it is shown that 
i) V-Al-antimonate based mixed oxides are promising catalytic systems for the selective 
formation ofACN from propane in the absence ofgas-phase additives, ii) ACN forms through 
the intermediate formation of propylene and the factor controlling the selectivity to ACN 
is the rate of the reaction for the formation of ACN from the intermediate propylene (rate 
which critically depends on the availability of ammonia on the catalyst surface), and iii) 
kinetic and economic analyses suggest the use of a process involving a high propane 
concentration with 02 and NH3 as limiting reagents to recycle unreacted propane. 
Introduction 
Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives for 
improving current acrylonitrile technology based on propylene ammoxidation: i) the increa- 
se in the propylene price provides the economic driving force to evaluate alternative lower 
cost feedstocks and ii) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants 
provides the opportunity to utilize new technology. The cost of propane feedstock is about 
5-6 times less than the cost of propylene and thus the development of a process based on 
propane as the main material appears to be the more direct evolution of the propylene 
ammoxidation process:

Survey of the Development 
of Catalyst and Process 
There are two main technological options for the conversion of propane to ACN: i) a two 
stage process based on a first dehydrogenation step of propane to propylene integrated to 
a second conventional unit for propylene to ACN or ii) a direct (one- stage) propane 
conversion to ACN. Even though the first option is already commercially available, the 
relative expensive cost of the dehydrogenation unit for propane limits interest in this 
solution, whereas the one-stage propane conversion to ACN appears more attractive. In 
fact, it can be estimated that in one-stage propane ammoxidation the production cost of 
ACN is around 15-208 lower than that resulting from the addition of a propane dehydro 
genation unit to an existing propylene ammoxidation plant. 
Various patents were published in the 1970-1975 [ll, principally by Monsanto Co., on 
the process of acrylonitrile synthesis from propane. The catalysts employed were mainly 
conventional propylene to ACN catalysts such as USb- or MoCe-mixed oxides, but good 
activities were obtained only at high temperatures (around 55O’C) and mainly in the

presence of gas-phase additives such as HxS and CH& 
in amount ranging from 0.2 to 
0.4%. These gas-phase additives were introduced to enhance the rate of the propane to 
propylene step 
by creating radical species active in H-abstraction from partinic C-H bonds. 
The presence of these additives, the related problems of material resistance as well as the 
severe reaction conditions limited the profitability of the process and it was not further 
developed on a commercial scale. 
In recent years a large number of patents, mainly from BP/Sohio have been tiled on new 
classes of catalysts not requiring the presence of gas-phase additives [2,3]. The patented 
catalysts are mainly based on two catalytic systems, U 
V-antimonate with a r-utile 
structure 
[21 and ii1 Bi-V-molybdate with a sheelite structure [31. Based on the patented results, 
V-antimonate systems appear to be the more active/selective in acrylonitrile formation. It 
can be estimated that notwithstanding the higher total fixed investment (around lo-15% 
higher for an equivalent size plant for propylene ammoxidation) required by the process, 
due to the more severe reaction conditions and lower productivity in the propane ammoxi- 
dation process with respect to the propylene process, the raw material cost advantage 
largely compensates this additional cost, thus resulting in a lower transfer price for the 
propane process. Indeed, BP/Sohio have announced tehir intended commercialization of the 
propane process in few years [4]. 
Nothwithstanding the interesting industrial outlooks, relatively few data exist on the 
characterization of catalysts for propane ammoxidation as well as on reaction kinetics and 
mechanisms. Four main catalytic systems have been investigated for this reaction: 
ij Ga-antimonates (pure or modified with W, Ni and P) have been studied mainly by Osipova 
and Sokolovski [5] and show several structural and reactivity analogies to the V-antimonate 
based system. The best performances of Ga- antimonate occurs when the Sb/Ga ratio on the 
surface is around 1[5cl, but with an excess of Sb in the bulk of the catalyst. 
ii) Bi-V-molybdate based catalysts have been studied by Moro-oka et al. [6] and similar 
compositions have been patented by BP/Sohio [3]. These catalysts are selective to acryloni- 
trile mainly using high propane and ammonia concentrations and results suggest that they 
catalyze the step from propylene to acrylonitrile, whereas the first step from propane to 
propylene occurs in the homogeneous gas phase. Similar conclusions have been indicated 
by Minow et al. [7] based on studies of propane ammoxidation on supported Bi-molybdate 
catalysts. 
iii1 
Vanadyl pyrophosphate, the active phase for the commercial process of butane conver- 
sion to maleic anhydride, has also been tested for propane ammoxidation 181 
as well as 
patented in the past [9], but the results were not so promising. 
iv) Finally, the activity of V-antimonate catalysts, patented in the past also by ICI [lOI, was 
reported for propane ammoxidation [8al about the same time as the appearence of the 
various patents from BP/Sohio [2]; however the reported selectivities were lower. 
In addition to these systems, the activities of V-,Mo-,Bi-Mo supported mixed oxides 
modified with various additives [7] and of V-silicalite and V-aluminophosphate catalysts 
[ill have also been reported for the reaction of propane to acrylonitrile, but low selectivities 
were found. Various other catalytic systems, such as MoPBiOx/AlgOs, NiCrOz/AlzOs, 
SnWOx/SiC, AgCd, BiPMoO heteropolyacids, FeBiO,, SnMoB9,, SnTQ, 
SbTiOx, MC+ 
SbOz/AlxOs are also cited in the various patents. 
Role of Reaction Conditions and Relationship with Process Options 
Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocar- 
bons, related to the absence ofboth lone pairs and empty orbit& in the former, a reasonable 
activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction tempera- 
tures around 500-55o’C; these temperatures are about lOO-15o’C higher than those requi- 
663 
red for propylene ammoxidation. Furthermore, contact times around 4-6 times longer (in 
the range of 2-10 set) are necessary to obtain high conversions. The productivity of the 
catalyst therefore is much lower which explains why the fixed cost investment is higher in 
the propane process as compared to the propylene process. For this reason, it is useful to 
develop a process from propane utilizing high hydrocarbon concentrations in order to 
increase the productivity. However, the choice of the reagent composition is limited by the 
presence of an explosion region in the ternary diagram of the reagents (propane-02 or 
air-NHs) . The lower explosion limit corresponds to a propane concentration below about 
1% vol, whereas the upper limit corresponds to propane concentrations higher than about 
10% vol. Higher productivities than those possible when operating below the lower explosion 
limit (usual conditions for hydrocarbon selective oxidation) thus require operating either 
inside the explosion limits or above the upper explosion limit. Reagent compositions 
reported in the patents [2,31 
are for both composition ranges, but especially for the former 
option (propane concentration around 6%). The first option (operating inside the explosion 
region) may be technically possible in the case of complete oxygen conversion in the outlet 
stream and using a fluidized bed reactor, but operation inside the explosion limits is always 
very critical. The second option is more reasonable, but in order to remain outside the 
explosion region, the propane conversion must be maintained relatively low, generally below 
50%. This means that recourse to this option requires a recycling of unreacted propane 
which, in turn, implies the use of 02 instead of air and a complete conversion of Ox and of 
NHs. In both these options therefore low oxygen to propane ratios (lower than 1.0) are 
required. 
Ammonia consumption in the propane process is higher than in the propylene ammoxi- 
dation process, because, due to higher contact times and reaction temperatures, the rate of 
the parallel reaction of ammonia oxidation to Ng is higher; therefore a larger fraction of 
NH3 is not utilized for the selective insertion in acrylonitrile molecules, thus resulting in a 
higher cost of the process. The higher rate of parallel oxidation of NH3 not only influences 
the variable cost of the process, but also results in a reduction of effective availability of 
ammonia on the surface of the catalyst for ACN synthesis with a drastic reduction in 
selectivity to ACN. The control of this parallel reaction on ammonia is thus of critical 
importance for the development of the process, and taking into account that this parallel 
reaction on NHs occurs both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phases, optimization 
of both reactor technology and catalyst is required. 
Finally, a very critical aspect in the development of the process is related to the control 
of the heat of reaction. As compared to the propylene process, the lower selectivity to ACN 
(higher formation ofcarbon oxides), the higher rate ofparallelNH3 oxidation, and the higher 
reaction temperature and contact times make very critical the control of reaction tempera- 
tures which may be the limiting factor for the development of a process using high propane 
concentrations. The use of suitable reactor options, such as a fluidixed-bed reactor, with an 
efficient removal of the heat of reaction is thus very important for process development. 
Reaction Network 
AS discussed above, V-Sb-Al mixed oxides currently represent the most promising 
candidate catalysts for the development of direct ACN synthesis from propane as feedstock. 
Thus in this section attention is focused on results obtained regarding the reaction network 
and reaction kinetics 1121 
on a V-Sb-Al-O catalyst promoted with W, whose composition and 
method of preparation are analogous to those reported for the best patented catalysts [23 
and also found optimal by us [121. 
The V:Sb:W atomic ratio is 1:5:1 and the composition of 
the catalyst is 30% wt of active component assumed as VSbO*+2SbxO4+WOs. The catalyst 
was calcined at 65O’C.

at 5Oo’C. At low conversion (shor- 
ter contact times) the primary re- 
action product is propylene which 
progressively decreases with a 
parallel increase in ACN selecti- 
vity. For the longer contact times 
(higher propane conv.) the conse- 
cutive conversion to carbon oxides 
of both propylene and ACN oc- 
curs. These results evidence two 
important 
aspects 
of this reac- 
tion: 
i) A very selective activation of 
propane to propylene occurs (se- 
lectivities higher than 80%1, 
whe- 
reas direct ACN synthesis from 
propane is of secondaryimportan- 
ce. ACN forms mainly from the 
intermediate propylene, but the 
contemporaneous presence of pro- 
pylene and ACN is observed over 
the entire range of propane conversion. This indicates that the rate of propylene to ACN 
transformation is relatively slow as compared to the rate of propane to propylene transfor- 
mation. A co-catalyst or suitable doping of a V-Sb-Al-O catalyst to improve the rate of 
propylene to ACN transformation can therefore considerably improve the selectivity to 
ACN. 
ii) Selectivities to ACN of about 60% can be obtained for propane conversions around 
40-5095; at higher propane conversion the consecutive oxidation to carbon oxides becomes 
critical. It is thUB 
necessary to limit this reaction and in this sense low 02 to propane ratios 
in the feedstock (oxygen as the limiting reagent) are preferable. On the other hand, in order 
to have high selectivities as well as to limit the heat release due to the formation of carbon 
oxides, low propane conversion must be considered. A suitable surface doping of the catalyst 
to reduce the consecutive oxidation to CO, of both propylene and ACN, thus to shift the

It should be noted, however, 
that the selectivity to ACN is in-

transformation to ACN and to 
CO,; the former rate depends 
considerably on the relative rate 
of the parallel ammonia oxida- 
tion to N2. This reaction occurs

depends on the type of reactor

rature (at the lower reaction tempe 
ratures longer contact times are re 
quired to obtain the same conversion 
and thus the relative importance of 
the homogeneous side reaction of 
ammonia oxidation is greater). This 
is shown in the comparison of the 
results obtained at high Wig. 1) and 
low (Fig. 2) reaction temperatures. 
In the second case, furthermore, the 
type of reactor (stainless steel inste- 
ad of quartz and higher dead volu- 
me) enhances the importance of the 
reaction of NH3 side conversion to 
Ng. It is clearly evident that in the 
second case (Fig. 2) much lower se- 
lectivities to 
ACN are obtained, whe- 
reas selectivity to propylene is much 
less a&cted. In general, however, 
lower global selectivities (propylene + ACN) are also obtained. 
Kinetics of the Reaction 
The kinetic analysis of propane ammoxidation to ACN on a V-Sb-Al-0 catalyst was 
carried out in both differential and integral tubular flow reactor conditions [D&l. Results 
in differential conditions of the dependence of the rates of formation of propylene (Ca=), 
acrylonitrile (ACN), acetonitrile (AcCN), HCN and cracking products (Cg) on propane, 02 
or NH3 concentrations (in the O-20% range) indicate that the rates of formation of these 
products can be described, according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, on the basis of two 
different sites for propane and for 02 and NH3 adsorption (competition between these two 
reagents on the same site) with a rate determining step involving the reaction between 
adsorbed propane, 02 and NHs. Using this model it is possible to describe the dependence 
of the rate offormation of products on NH3 concentration, which, in particular for propylene, 
shows the presence of a self-inhibition effect (presence of a maximum in the rate of urouvlene

dependence of the rates of formation

effect as well as the higher rate of 
propylene formation with respect to

(low conversion). The symbols in Fig.

the lines drawn in the figure were 
calculated from the kinetic model.

Catalytic tests were also carried 
out in integral reactor conditions, in 
order to obtain information on the 
rate of the consecutive reactions. Re- 
ported in Rig. 4 is, for example, the 
dependence of the yield of products 
on the space-velocity; also in this 
case the symbols refer to experimen- 
666 
tal data, and lines to calculated values from the kinetic studies. It is shown that maximum 
yield, around 35-4096, 
in ACN can be obtained for a propane conversion of about 60-80%. 
For higher conversion, the yield to ACN decreases due to consecutive reactions. 
In conclusion, kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes 
through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation 
of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared 
to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene. Maximum yields and selectivities of 
ACN obtained were in the 35-40% and 5060% range, for propane conversions around 
4050% and 60-80%, respectively. These data alone illustrate the value of the development 
of the new process from propane, but also indicate that considerable further improvment 
in catalyst performance may still be possible. Kinetic analysis, in fact, suggests future work 
in the area of co-catalysts to enhance the propylene to ACN conversion and the use of higher 
propane/(&+NHal ratios with propane recycling and 02 rather than air as the source of 
feed oxygen.
