The 6th Irsee Symposium sponsored by the Robert Karl Grasselli Foundation took place between 4 and 7 July 2013 at the Schwäbisches Bildungszentrum in Irsee, Germany.
As in previous such symposia, the main purpose of the meeting was to bring together a small, select group of experts in the field of selective oxidation catalysis from around the world in a tranquil and hospitable environment to informally discuss their newest findings and to exchange views of how to further advance the field, and thereby impact the wellbeing of the world. For these reasons we expanded the symposium this time to also include experts in the area of electrocatalyis, which is another crucial field to advance future technologies.
The symposium began, appropriately for these forward looking gatherings, with a presentation dealing with designing catalysts for tomorrow’s processes; a noble task indeed; and thereby set an ambitious tone for the whole symposium.
A significant number of presentations, recorded here, dealt with the subject of the MoVNbTeOx catalyst, particularly the M1 phase, for the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid or ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. The structure of the M1 system is now thoroughly studied and understood, based on spectroscopic and electron microscopic studies, and the reaction mechanistic consequences drawn therefrom are updated to reflect the latest structural refinements.
Theoretical studies of the VPO system for the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride reveal the revolutionary concept which proposes that the paraffin is activated by a non-metal oxo-moiety, namely by P5+=O, rather than by a metal oxo-moiety, namely V5+=O, as has been generally agreed upon up to now. An analysis of the pertinent patent literature pertaining to VPO catalysts aims at identifying clues about how to improve the commercial catalyst, since any single digit yield improvement on a scale of 2.7 Billion Tons/year world production would save a significant amount of unnecessarily wasted hydrocarbon feed and therefore presents a substantial economic incentive.
A new catalytic approach to the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene was presented using Dy-doped (oxy)halides as catalysts. These systems operate as melts, are stable under reaction conditions, have long life times, and most impressively do not produce any chlorinated byproducts, even though operated at rather high temperatures (~600 °C), that were the culprits in earlier catalytic systems using halogen containing catalysts or halide co-feeds. An impressive accomplishment, indeed!
Several papers covered sophisticated instrumental techniques for characterizing oxidation catalysts; some covered homogeneous catalytic systems for the synthesis of complex oxygenated molecules that can be used as building blocks for pharmaceuticals; still others dealt with sustainable catalytic systems for epoxidation reactions useful in environmentally friendly biosynthetic areas; and a first at these symposia was a contribution reviewing the benefits of Au-catalyzed selective oxidations.
Concluding our symposium were presentations in the area of electrocatalysis that explored the very fundamentals of this exciting field and concluded with some real-world examples for electrocatalytically producing products of interest in everyday life.
We thank all the participants who journeyed from 12 different nations to our symposium in Irsee, Germany, presented magnificent papers of their interesting work, interacted and exchanged ideas freely so that we all profited from this exchange, and went home invigorated and motivated to continue our individual work, enriched by the Irsee interactions.
We thank also Dr. A.F. Volpe (RKG Foundation Comptroller) and Dr. J.D. Burrington (RKG Foundation Secretary) for their part in helping organize this successful symposium
