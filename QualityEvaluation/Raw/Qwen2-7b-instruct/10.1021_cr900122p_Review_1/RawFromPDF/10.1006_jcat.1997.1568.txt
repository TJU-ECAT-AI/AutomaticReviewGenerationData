Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt%
active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where
A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates
having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe,
Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of
propane to propylene. The reaction is catalytic and is ﬁrst order in
propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methy-
lene hydrogen being the rate limiting step. Propane conversion and
yields of propylene produced vary greatly with the choice of the
A metal of the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst.
At 560◦C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conver-
sion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2
(16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2.
The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly inﬂuences
the catalytic activity and useful product yields. The effect is largest
for the Ni–molybdate system whose optimum lies at stoichiome-
try. The optimum activity of Co–molybdate lies at molybdenum
lean compositions. Binary Ni–Co–molybdates are less sensitive to
molybdenum level, offering a conveniently stable catalytic system
for further mechanistic and technological optimization studies. Ad-
dition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of
the Ni–Co–molybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by
retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a pos-
sibility for desired lower process temperature operation. Our studies
suggest, that the Ni–Co molybdate system provides an alternate to
V-based catalysts for the activation of light parafﬁns. Futuristically,
it holds promise as the parafﬁn activating component of a two com-
ponent catalyst system for the direct conversion, in a single reactor,
of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile, with the second compo-
nent being composed of one of the well known oleﬁn converting,
multicomponent mixed metal molybdates.

INTRODUCTION
The discovery and successful commercialization of het-
erogeneously catalyzed selective oxidations and ammox-
idations of oleﬁnic feedstocks to useful oxygen or nitro-
gen containing intermediates has had a major impact on

Germany.
both industrial and fundamental catalysis (1). More re-
cently (2), research aims have shifted from functionalizing
oleﬁns to functionalizing the more abundant and less ex-
pensive parafﬁnic feedstocks, in an effort to meet future
chemical, ﬁber, and polymer needs. One of the newer ap-
proaches has been selective oxydehydrogenation of lower
alkanes, a two-electron oxidation, to functionalize paraf-
ﬁns to the corresponding oleﬁns. The oleﬁns produced may
then be used as feedstocks in selective oleﬁn oxidation and
ammoxidation processes. Alternatively, parafﬁn activating
catalysts may be combined with compatible oleﬁn conver-
sion catalysts to produce the corresponding oxygen or ni-
trogen containing unsaturated products directly.
In the area of parafﬁn oxydehydrogenation, several
systems have emerged in recent years holding some
promise for further study and development, particularly
when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane. By far
the most studied systems for propane upgrading center
around vanadium (3), vanadium–antimony (4), vanadium–
molybdenum (5), and vanadium–phosphorus based cata-
lysts (6). Vanadium based systems activate propane at fairly
low temperatures (down to 400◦C), and it has been pro-
posed that their effectiveness might stem from the “met-
alloradical character” of vanadium (7). Other alkane ac-
tivating systems reported in the literature include metal
phosphates (8), metal niobates (9), and metal molybdates
(10–13).
Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they
exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane ac-
tivation at relatively low temperature. While Hardman (10)
studied primarily CoMoO4 based catalysts for the oxydehy-
drogenation of propane to propylene, and Mazzochia et al.
(11) primarily NiMoO4, we undertook a broader investiga-
tion of propane oxydehydrogenation, studying single and
binary molybdates of the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni,
Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn; some ternary molybdates of the for-
mulaNi0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4,whereX = P,Bi,Fe,Cr,V,and
Ce; and systems of the formula Ni0.5Co0.5Y0.002MoO4, where
Y = K or Cs. A recent study of Moro-oka et al. (13) also ex-
amines propane oxidation with metal molybdate catalysts,
and a review of propane oxydehydrogenation was recently
reported by Cavani and Triﬁro (14).

PROPANE OXIDATION OVER METAL MOLYBDATES
551
EXPERIMENTAL
The molybdate catalysts used in this study were prepared
by reﬂuxing aqueous solutions of stoichiometric amounts of
the appropriate metal nitrate salts with ammonium hepta-
molybdate in the presence of silica sol (LUDOX AS-40).
After drying the entire mixture and pulverizing, the resul-
tant material was air calcined for 4 h at 290◦C and 4 h
at 600◦C, pelletized, and sized to 20/40 mesh for catalytic
evaluation. All catalysts were silica supported (80% active
phase, 20% SiO2).
The catalysts were characterized by powder diffraction
techniques at room temperature, using relatively slow scan
speeds (step size = 0.02◦, scanning time = 2 s/step) with data
accumulation from 4 to 70◦2θ. X-ray indexing was done by
referencing to an internal standard of LaB6 (NIST SRM
660). BET surface areas were measured with a Micromerit-
ics ASAP 2400 N2 physisorption apparatus.
The catalysts were evaluated in a ﬁxed-bed, quartz mi-
croreactor, operated at ambient pressure. The gaseous feed
to the reactor was prepared by metering propane, oxygen,
and nitrogen with mass ﬂow controllers. The reactor con-
sisted of a wide bore top section (13 mm o.d., 10 mm i.d.,
25 cm long) on top of a narrow bore exit line (6 mm o.d./
2 mm i.d., 23 cm long). The pelletized, to 20/40 mesh sized,
catalyst was mixed with an equal weight of 20/40 mesh acid
washed quartz chips, the mixture then supported on quartz
wool directly above the juncture in the reactor and covered
with a 10-cm-long preheat zone of 20/40 mesh quartz chips
to minimize dead volume. A 6-mm-o.d. quartz thermowell
was centered axially in the reactor, which allowed for mon-
itoring the temperature of the entire active catalyst bed.
The catalyst bed was isothermal (±2◦C), and the furnace
temperature was adjusted for the exothermicity of the re-
action in the catalyst bed. Temperatures reported herein are
catalyst operating temperatures at conditions as speciﬁed.
The composition of the feed and product streams was
determined by gas chromatography. The reactor efﬂuent
ﬂowed directly through a heat traced line to a heated GC
sampling valve to the GC (on-line analysis for oxygenates),
then through an ice-cooled trap and a gas collection bulb
to vent. Oxygenates and C+
5 products were analyzed with
a Varian GC using a 50-m DB-1 capillary column (FID
detector). The gas collection bulb was sampled off-line with
a Carle reﬁnery gas analyzer (RGA) equipped with TCD
and FID detectors. C1, C◦
2, C=
2 , and ﬁxed gases (O2, N2, CO,
and CO2) were analyzed with the TCD, while saturated and
unsaturated C3 and C4 components were analyzed on the
FID. Water was not measured.
Catalysts were evaluated in two ways. In the ﬁrst test,
1 g of 20/40 mesh catalyst dispersed in 1 g quartz chips was
loaded in a reactor (see above), the catalyst was calcined
under air (100 cc/min) for 1 h at 700◦C, and feed (a 60 cc/min
mixture of C◦
3, O2, and N2 (15 : 15 : 70)) was introduced after
cooling to 560◦C under N2 ﬂush. The second test was per-
formed in a likewise manner, except that feed was diverted
as necessary to vary contact time (WHSV varied from 0.8
to 4, total gas ﬂow rates of 250 to 30 cc/min), to obtain a
range of hydrocarbon conversions.
Conversion is deﬁned as the mole fraction of feed carbon
or oxygen present in all reaction products. Yield is the mole
fraction of feed carbon present in a product, and selectiv-
ity is yield divided by conversion. The data reported here
were obtained at oxygen conversions of 80% or less. The
background reactivity of both propane and propylene with
oxygen, measured in a reactor ﬁlled with quartz chips, is in-
signiﬁcant (less than 1.5% under the most severe conditions
studied). Carbon and hydrogen closures were typically bet-
ter than 97%, oxygen closures typically better than 95%
(closures were calculated based on reaction stoichiometry,
including the anticipated water formation). The results re-
ported are corrected for any carbon nonclosure.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Catalyst Characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the metal
molybdates AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and Zn,
are shown in Fig. 1. As reported in the literature (15–17),
three structural types are possible for these molybdates:
α-MnMoO4, α-CoMoO4, and NiWO4 (α-ZnMoO4). The
patterns for cobalt, magnesium, and manganese molybdate
reference well to the α-MnMoO4 structural type, while
those for nickel molybdate reference to the α-CoMoO4
structural type. The two structural types are similar, con-
taining octahedrally coordinated cations (Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+,
Mn2+), but either tetrahedrally (α-MnMoO4) or octahe-
drally coordinated (α-CoMoO4) molybdenum. As reported
by Sleight and Chamberlain (17), the structures of some
of these materials interconvert on heating, while others

do not. Thus, reversible interconversion of CoMoO4
from the α-CoMoO4 structure type to the α-MnMoO4
structure type occurs at 500◦C, while such interconversion
occurs for NiMoO4 at or above 690◦C. The MgMoO4 and
MnMoO4 systems do not interconvert upon heating and
retain their α-MnMoO4 structure type throughout the
temperature range studied. Our zinc molybdate references
well to the NiWO4 structural type. This structural type
is formed for the other molybdates evaluated here only
under high pressure synthesis conditions (15, 16) and is
thus unimportant in our current study.
FIG. 3.
Lattice expansion of Ni1−xCoxMoO4 with increasing Co content.
A series of binary nickel cobalt molybdates was also
prepared (Ni1−xCoxMoO4, where x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
and 1). The X-ray diffraction patterns are presented in
Fig. 2. As discussed above, the XRD patterns of nickel
and cobalt molybdate are illustrative of the patterns for
the α-CoMoO4 and α-MnMoO4 structural types, with char-
acteristic d-spacings centered at 3.73, 3.51, and 3.09 ˚
A and
at 3.81, 3.35, and 3.14 ˚
A for these two phases, respectively.
The (2 2 0) reﬂection (ca. 28.5◦2θ) is common to both struc-
tural types and a lattice expansion is observed for the series
Ni1−xCoxMoO4, going from NiMoO4 to CoMoO4, by fol-
lowing the shift in the d-spacing of the (2 2 0) reﬂection from
3.096 to 3.140 ˚
A, respectively. This increase in d-spacing is
consistent with the increase in six coordinate ionic radii of
Ni2+ (0.69 ˚
A) to Co2+ (0.74 ˚
A) and is reﬂected in a lin-
ear increase across the entire series with an increase in the
Co/Ni ratio (Fig. 3). Since both the cell dimensions and the
relative intensities representative of these two compounds
vary linearly with the Ni/Co atomic ratio, and by consid-
ering the size and gross chemical nature of Ni2+ and Co2+
ions, application of Vegard’s Law (19) leads us to conclude
that the structures of the mixed nickel–cobalt–molybdates
are solid solutions of NiMoO4 and CoMoO4 in a common
molybdate lattice.
X-ray diffraction patterns of binary Ni0.5A0.5MoO4,
where A = Co, Mg, Mn, and Zn reveal that introduction
of any one of these four metals greatly inﬂuences the struc-
tural behavior of the Ni–molybdate host. All four metals

shift the structure of the base from the α-Co–molybdate
type (octahedral Mo coordination) to the α-Mn–molybdate
type (tetrahedral Mo coordination). X-ray diffraction pat-
terns of substituted Ni–Co–molybdates were also taken
(Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Fe, Bi, Ce, Cr, and
V, and Ni0.5Co0.05Y0.002MoO4, where Y = K, Cs). The X-ray
patterns of these substituted compounds are similar to that
of the base Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, leading us to conclude that in-
troduction of low levels of auxiliary metals into the Ni–Co–
molybdate host does not alter signiﬁcantly the structure of
the host.
Catalyst Evaluation
A. AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, Zn.
The disap-
pearance of propane over this set of catalysts is ﬁrst order
as revealed by the straight lines in plotting the logarithm of
(1-propane conversion) vs inverse space velocity (Fig. 4).
This observation is consistent with C–H bond breaking of
a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step in the
activation of propane.
The activity varies greatly with the choice of the A metal
and the surface area of the catalyst (Table 1):

inﬂuenced by the nature of the A metal. Most probably it is
the nature of the molybdenum oxygen bond, as inﬂuenced
by the nature of the adjacent A metal, which is responsible
for the activation of propane. Thus, a Ni–O–Mo–O is much
more active than a Zn–O–Mo–O.
The selectivity of non-COx products (i.e., mainly propy-
lene) decreases with propane conversion (Fig. 5), implying
consecutive reaction and destruction of the propylene in-
termediate as the concentration of propylene builds up. In
most cases the non-COx (i.e., useful) products consist of
about 96% propylene, 3–5% acrolein, and 0–1% acrylic
acid. The selectivity at comparable conversion is highest

for the NiMoO4 catalyst, followed closely by MgMoO4. The
systems CoMoO4, MnMoO4, and ZnMoO4 form a catalyst
set of lower selectivity.
It is apparent from these results (i.e., activity being
strongly inﬂuenced by the A metal of the molybdate) that
propane activation and its conversion to propylene is a sur-
face catalyzed reaction and not a homogeneous phase, rad-
ical generated reaction.
B. Ni0.5A0.5MoO4, where A = Co, Mg, Mn, Zn.
Binary
metal molybdates containing nickel as one of the metals
do not exhibit any activity synergism over and above the
base reactivity of NiMoO4 itself (Fig. 6). However, there
appears to be some synergy between Ni and Co in the
binary system Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4. By comparing the results
of the simple metal molybdates (Fig. 4) with those of the
binary metal molybdates (Fig. 6), it is apparent that the
Ni–Co system is the most active of the binary systems
studied, even though CoMoO4 ranked fourth among the
simple molybdates. The activity ranking of the binaries
is: Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4 > Ni0.5Mn0.5MoO4 > Ni0.5Mg0.5MoO4 >
Ni0.5Zn0.5MoO4.
Similarly, among the binary molybdates, the selectivity to
non-COx products (primarily propylene) is highest at com-
parable conversions (numbers in parentheses are selectivi-
ties at 7 and 15% propane conversions, respectively) for the
Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4 (86, 72), followed by Ni/Mg (83, 63), Ni/Mn
(79, 58), and Ni/Zn (75, 44) molybdates (Table 1). At these
conversion levels the selectivity to non-COx products of
the binary molybdate Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4, and the most active
PROPANE OXIDATION OVER METAL MOLYBDATES

simple molybdate NiMoO4 (85, 66) are comparable. These
observations, in conjunction with the observation that bi-
nary molybdates are synthetically easier to reproduce than
the catalytically most active simple molybdate NiMoO4, led
us to investigate the binary Ni–Co–molybdate system more
thoroughly.
C. Ni1−xCoxMoO4,wherex = 0to1.
Thedisappearance
of propane is also ﬁrst order for the Ni/Co binary molyb-
dates, as evidenced by the straight lines obtained when
plotting the logarithm of (1-propane conversion) against
inverse space velocity. The activity ranking and relative sur-
face areas (Table 1) are:

A plot (Fig. 7) of k vs the Ni/Co concentration gives an
S shape curve which tracks approximately the surface area
of the respective catalysts. The S shape curve suggests also
that replacement of up to 25% of either Ni by Co or Co
by Ni is catalytically, as well as surface-area-wise, mainly
dominated by the nature of the respective majority metal
on either end of the compositional range.
A similar trend is also seen with the non-COx selec-
tivity as a function of propane conversion (Fig. 8). At
comparable conversion, the high Ni containing catalysts
form one set of curves while the high Co containing cata-
lysts form a second set of curves. The non-COx yield is

higher for the high Ni compositions than for the high Co
compositions.
D. A Mo1 ± xOy, where A = Ni, Co and x = 0 to 0.1.
A
study of the A/Mo ratio (Table 2, Fig. 9) reveals that both
the catalytic activity and the non-COx yield are highly sen-
sitive to the molybdenum content of these compositions.
Particularly sensitive is the Ni composition, where the stoi-
chiometric composition NiMoO4 exhibits by far the highest
propane activity, as well as the highest non-COx yield. Both
fall off precipitously on either side of stoichiometry (on the
molybdenum rich, as well as, the molybdenum lean side).
Co–molybdate compositions are much less sensitive to
the molybdenum content. Unlike the Ni compositions, the
optimum activity and non-COx yield are not attained at
Co/Mo stoichiometry, but rather at molybdenum lean com-
positions. Since CoMoO4 is a well known catalyst for con-
verting propylene to acrolein, it is possible that the stoi-
chiometric compound or a molybdenum rich composition
thereof provides for facile adsorption of propylene, the ﬁrst
formed product of propane conversion, forming acrolein,
which readily converts further to COx under the conditions
used in the study. In addition, the chemisorbed propylene
and acrolein can inhibit the interaction of the propane with
the surface, resulting in self-poisoning of the surface and
hence lower rates of propane activation. These issues, in-
cluding a comprehensive analysis of propane activation ki-
netics over these molybdates, are discussed in a subsequent
article in this journal (20).
The Ni0.5Co0.5Mo1 ± xOy compositions lie between the ex-
tremes of NiMo1 ± xOy and CoMo1 ± xOy, with regard to the
variation in propane conversion and propylene yield as a
function of Mo content. They are signiﬁcantly less affected
than the Ni only composition and somewhat more affected
than the Co only composition. It is a good compromise
composition for further studies (20).

A plot of k vs surface area (Fig. 10) for stoichiometric,
molybdenum lean, and molybdenum rich compositions re-
veals that as a group, stoichiometric molybdates are the
most active, the molybdenum lean molybdates less active,
and the molybdenum rich compositions the least active. It
is interesting to note that the activity of the stoichiometric
molybdates rises approximately with the cube of the surface
area, the molybdenum-lean compositions with the square,
and the molybdenum-rich molybdates linearly with surface
area. The exact meaning of this behavior is unclear at this

time. However, it is clear that propane oxydehydrogenation
is a surface catalyzed reaction, and not a gas phase, free
radical initiated reaction, otherwise such large surface area
dependencies would not be found. And since for these and
other reasons discussed above, the activation of propane is a
surface catalyzed reaction, and since all of our studies point
to the active sites being composed of A–O–Mo–O moieties,
it is safe to assume that the largest concentration of such
moieties will be found on the surface with stoichiometric
compositions. Furthermore, the nature of the A metal in

the A–O–Mo–O catalytic site is of uppermost importance
for the activation of the parafﬁn, with Ni being the most
efﬁcient A metal of those studied. Thus, Ni-rich composi-
tions lie in activity above the Co-rich compositions. Since,
according to our studies the oxygen of the Mo adjacent to
the A metal in the A–O–Mo–O site is the actual abstractor
of the rate limiting methylene hydrogen from the propane,
molybdenum lean compositions will be less active than the
stoichiometric ones (square dependence with surface area
for the former and a cube dependence for the latter). Fi-
nally, it can be reasoned that the molybdenum rich composi-
tions will be the least active among the studied molybdates
(linear dependence of activity with surface area), because
the concentration of A–O–Mo–O sites on the surface will
be the lowest. As the concentration of molybdenum in-
creases, the amount of suprasurface MoO3 can become
signiﬁcant (up to a monolayer) and ultimately excessive
(greater than a monolayer), with the result, that the cata-
lyst begins to act as if it were simply MoO3 supported on
AMoO4; it becomes relatively inactive.
The selectivity to non-COx products at comparable
propane conversion (Tables 1 and 2) is highest for the Mo-
rich and lowest for the Mo-lean compositions. A possible
explanation consistentwiththeactivityresultsof thesecata-
lysts is that the Mo-lean compositions possess a high A
metal surface concentration which can lead to the forma-
tion of surface A–O–A moieties and higher A–O–A clus-
ters and ultimately to the formation of surface AO (e.g.,
NiO). Either of these possibilities would lead to high, non-
selective propane conversions, resulting in waste products.
Therefore, the surface of A-rich compositions attacks and
combusts the formed propylene more readily than the sur-
face of the stoichiometric or Mo-rich compositions. Among
this series, the Mo-rich compositions are the most selec-
tive ones in forming non-COx products (i.e., propylene),
implying that consecutive combustion of the ﬁrst formed
propylene and the second formed acrolein is less preva-
lent here than with compositions having less molybdenum.
This is certainly consistent with the site isolation theory of
selective oxidation catalysis (21), and the behavior of mul-
ticomponent catalysts containing excess molybdenum for
the selective oxidation or ammoxidation of oleﬁns to the
corresponding aldehydes, acids, or nitriles (22).

The addition of redox elements greatly enhances catalytic
activity, e.g., V by a factor of 4 (absolute), 10 (relative);
Ce, Fe, Cr, by a factor of 2 (absolute), 3 (relative). Addi-
tion of P is innocuous, while the addition of Bi, as well as,

alkalis (K, Cs) greatly decreases the catalytic activity of the
base.
Likely explanations for the observed behavior are that
the addition of elements capable of one-electron redox
shuttle increase the catalytic activity of the base molyb-
date by keeping the latter in a high, and therefore active,
oxidation state (i.e., Mo6+). Conversely, addition of alkalis
reduces the effectiveness of the redox shuttle, decreasing
the activity of the base. Addition of Bi, through the likely
formation of some BixMoyOz, provides for ready oxygen
insertion into the ﬁrst formed propylene product, leading
to acrolein whose strongly inhibited desorption leads to
blockage of propane adsorption sites (i.e., decreased activ-
ity) and ready formation of COx (i.e., decreased non-COx
selectivity).
While the addition of redox elements V, Ce, Fe, and Cr
leads to lower propylene (non-COx product) selectivities
at the reaction temperature (560◦C) studied (exception is
Cr), their markedly higher activities provide for the tech-
nologically important possibility of carrying out the reac-
tion at lower temperatures, which is not incumbent upon
the base itself. Therefore, it is surmised that higher propy-
lene yields at comparable conversions would be obtained
at lower temperatures with redox promoted systems. Of
particular promise is Cr, followed by Ce and Fe promoted
systems. Additional work is needed to work out the com-
positional details.
CONCLUSIONS
A brief study of propane oxydehydrogenation to propy-
lene over ﬁrst row, divalent metal molybdates (AMoO4)
supported on SiO2 reveals that the reaction is catalytic and
not a gas phase radical initiated reaction. It further reveals
that the reaction is ﬁrst order in propane, consistent with the
rate limiting step being the C–H bond breaking abstraction
of a methylene hydrogen from the propane molecule.
The yields of propylene at constant conversion vary
greatly between the catalysts studied, and the highest ob-
served yields (16% at 26.6% conversion) are obtained
with NiMoO4 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4. The NiMoO4 system
is very sensitive to the Ni/Mo ratio and performs best
at stoichiometry. Conversely, CoMoO4 gives the highest
propylene yields with a molybdenum lean composition.
Ni1−xCoxMoOy compositions give results intermediate to
the two end members, with up to about 25% of the alter-
nate elements incorporation giving approximately the be-
havior of the respective end members. To achieve stability
and ease of catalyst reproducibility, Ni–Co–molybdates are
preferred over single element molybdates. Propane activa-
tion kinetics and its reaction network over Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4
are reported in another publication (20).
Incorporation of redox elements such as V, Ce, Fe, and
Cr greatly increases the activity of the base: e.g., V by a
factor of four; Ce, Fe, and Cr by a factor of two. This allows
for propane activation and possible process operation at
lower temperatures (i.e., below 560◦C), concomitant with
anticipated improved useful product yields. Of particular
promise is the Cr promoted system.
We conclude further that the Ni–Co–molybdate systems
are at least as effective as V-based catalysts for the activa-
tion of propane to propylene. Unfortunately, the rapid oxi-
dation of the ﬁrst formed propylene to subsequent products
(such as acrolein and COx) limits the usefulness of these sys-
tems for the production of propylene from propane at high
conversions. Operation at low propane conversions results
ingoodpropyleneselectivities;however,thatwouldrequire
high recycle of unconverted propane, which is impractical.
Another process possibility is operation at high propane
to oxygen ratio, but that also requires high propane recy-
cle. Cyclic (redox) mode of operation in absence of gaseous
oxygen holds some promise, as do redox element promoted
(e.g., Cr containing) systems. Both need further study.
A possible future application of the Ni–Co–molybdate
system, particularly a redox promoted one, might be in the
conversion of propane in the presence of NH3 and oxy-
gen (air) to acrylonitrile. The idea (22) is to combine the
parafﬁn activating Ni–Co–molybdate catalyst with one of
the well known multicomponent mixed metal molybdates
(23) in a single reactor, converting the propylene interme-
diate formed in situ to acrylonitrile. Well dispersed physi-
cal or compacted mixtures of these two types of catalysts
may achieve this goal. It is necessary to temperature match
the two catalysts, i.e., to ﬁnd a common compromise tem-
perature optimum by compositionally tuning both of these
compositions. Either the Ni–Co–molybdate must be modi-
ﬁed to operate at a lower temperature by addition of redox
elements such as V, Fe, Ce, Cr (see above), or the multicom-
ponent molybdate catalyst (23) must be modiﬁed to operate
at higher temperature by adjusting its redox behavior (e.g.,
replacing Fe by Ce).
