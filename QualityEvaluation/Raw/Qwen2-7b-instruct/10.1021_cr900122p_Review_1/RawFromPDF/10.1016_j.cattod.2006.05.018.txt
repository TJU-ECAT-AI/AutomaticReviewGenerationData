Abstract
Mesoporous molecular sieves containing iron sites with different dispersions and environments were studied for the partial oxidation of
methane and the epoxidation of propylene. The tetrahedral Fe(III) sites incorporated inside the framework of SBA-15 showed higher HCHO
selectivity under a similar CH4 conversion than the oligomeric FeOx clusters located in the mesopores in the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2. HCHO
selectivity of the FeOx clusters in SBA-15 could be improved by the modiﬁcation with either an acidic group (e.g., phosphate) or an alkali metal ion,
which increased the dispersion or changed the local coordination environment of iron species. The catalyst containing FePO4 clusters formed by
the modiﬁcation with phosphate exhibited the best catalytic performances for HCHO formation. This catalyst also showed uniquely high
selectivities to HCHO and CH3OH as N2O was used as the oxidant for the partial oxidation of CH4. For the epoxidation of propylene to propylene
oxide (PO), the modiﬁcation of the FeOx/SBA-15 with an alkali metal salt typiﬁed by KCl was effective. Among many SBA-15-supported
transition metal oxides modiﬁed by KCl, the KCl-FeOx/SBA-15 showed the best catalytic performances for the epoxidation of propylene by N2O.
The comparative studies using N2O and O2 as the oxidant revealed that N2O was necessary for PO formation over the KCl-FeOx/SBA-15 catalyst.

1. Introduction
The exploitation of iron as the active site in synthetic
catalysts for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons has received
extensive research attention because iron is the active center in
monooxygenase enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and
methane monooxygenase. There are numerous studies on
homogeneous catalytic systems using iron compounds or iron
complexes for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [1,2].
However, iron-based heterogeneous oxidation catalytic systems
reported so far are limited. Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst combined with
N2O oxidant was effective for the selective oxidation of
benzene to phenol [3]. Although it was shown that the adsorbed
oxygen (a-oxygen) pre-generated by the decomposition of N2O
over the Fe-ZSM-5 may react with CH4 even at room
temperature to form surface methoxy species, the steady-state
catalytic oxidation of CH4 with N2O at a temperature needed
for N2O decomposition only produced CO and CO2 as the main
products with a minor amount of CH3OH [3,4]. Wang and
Otsuka [5–8] showed in a series of studies that FePO4 was an
efﬁcient catalyst for the partial oxidation of CH4 to HCHO by
O2 and to oxygenates including CH3OH and HCHO by O2–H2
gas mixture or N2O. Kobayashi et al. [9–11] clariﬁed that a
small amount of Fe3+ doped in silica could catalyze the partial
oxidation of CH4 to HCHO by O2, and it was proposed that the
small amount of mononuclear FeIII probably incorporated into
the silica matrix was responsible for HCHO formation. Arena
and Parmaliana [12–14] adopted an ‘‘adsorption–precipita-
tion’’ method for the synthesis of the FeOx/SiO2 samples
containing relatively higher concentration of iron species with
high dispersion and investigated their catalytic activities for
partial oxidation of CH4 by O2.
A few studies have contributed to the epoxidation of alkenes
using Fe-containing heterogeneous catalysts. Fe-MCM-41 with
FeIII in the framework of MCM-41 could catalyze the
epoxidation of styrene with diluted H2O2 [15]. Single-site
FeIII centers grafted on the inner surfaces of SBA-15 showed a
high efﬁciency for the epoxidation of various alkenes with

H2O2 [16]. Duma and Ho
¨nicke once reported an interesting gas-
phase epoxidation of propylene by N2O over a Na+-added
Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst [17].
Most of the existing researches seem to suggest that a high
dispersion of iron species is necessary for the selective
oxidation reactions since iron oxides such as a-Fe2O3 tend to
catalyze the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons to CO and CO2.
More detailed elucidations of structure–reactivity relationships
are important for the development of efﬁcient iron-based
heterogeneous
selective
oxidation
catalysts.
Mesoporous
materials possess ordered porous structures, and the active
components tailored in their nano-ordered spaces may have
improved catalytic performances. We have clariﬁed that MCM-
41 and SBA-15 are superior catalyst supports for FePO4, VOx
and MoOx for the partial oxidation of CH4 [18–21]. Moreover,
iron may have different locations and different local structures
in a mesoporous silica, e.g., FeOx clusters in mesopores or
isolated FeIII in framework positions. In a previous paper, we
showed that the FeIII in the framework of MCM-41 was more
efﬁcient than the FeOx clusters for the conversion of CH4 to
HCHO by O2 [22]. The environment of the iron sites can further
be modiﬁed by the presence of acidic groups or alkali metal
ions. We have been working on the elucidation of the
relationships between the structures and environments of the
active iron sites introduced into mesoporous silica and their
catalytic behaviors in selective oxidation reactions. In the
present paper, we present some of our recent research results on
the partial oxidation of CH4 to useful oxygenates and the
epoxidation of propylene, which are two highly desirable but
very difﬁcult reactions.
2. Experimental
Iron-containing SBA-15 materials were prepared by the
following methods. In the direct synthesis, an iron source
(FeCl3) was added into the synthesis gel containing the silica
source (SiCl4) and the template (Pluronic P123 triblock
copolymer). After hydrothermal synthesis, the resultant solid
was ﬁltered, washed, dried and ﬁnally calcined at 550 or 650 8C
for 6 h. The obtained samples were denoted as Fe-SBA-15. The
conventional impregnation method was also applied to the
preparation of iron-containing SBA-15 samples (denoted as
FeOx/SBA-15) using an ethanolic solution of [Fe(acac)3] (acac,
acetylacetonate). The FeOx/SBA-15 was modiﬁed by various
acid and alkaline additives including P, S, B, Li, Na, K, Rb and
Cs by impregnation of the FeOx/SBA-15 with an aqueous
solution of phosphate, sulphate, borate or an alkali metal salt.
The catalysts were characterized by XRD, diffuse reﬂec-
tance UV–vis, and Raman spectroscopic measurements. XRD
was performed with a Panalytical X’Pert Pro Super X-ray
diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. Diffuse reﬂectance UV–
vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary-5000 spectrometer
equipped with a diffuse-reﬂectance accessory. Raman spectro-
scopic measurements were carried out with a Renishaw UV–vis
Raman System 1000R. The UV-line at 325 nm from a Kimmon
IK3201R-F He–Cd laser was used as the exciting source to
avoid the inﬂuence of ﬂuorescence.
The partial oxidation of CH4 and the epoxidation of C3H6
were carried out using a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow reactor (quartz tube)
operated at atmospheric pressure. The products were analysed
by on-line gas chromatography. All the lines and valves
between the exit of the reactor and the gas chromatographs
were heated to 120 8C to prevent the condensation of products.
Porapak T column was used for the separation of CH3OH and
HCHO in the case of CH4 partial oxidation, and for the
separation of PO, acrolein, allyl alcohol, acetone, propional-
dehyde and acetaldehyde in the case of C3H6 oxidation. The
separations of other products and the remaining reactants in
both cases were achieved by Porapak Q and Molecular Sieve
5A columns.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparative studies of iron-containing mesoporous
materials synthesized by different method for partial
oxidation of CH4 by O2
In a previous paper [22], we carried out comparative studies
with Fe-MCM-41 synthesized by two different methods, i.e.,
the direct hydrothermal (DHT) and the template-ion exchange
(TIE) methods, and arrived at a conclusion that the iron sites
isolated in the framework in the Fe-MCM-41-DHT were more
active and selective than the oligomeric FeOx in the Fe-MCM-
41-TIE for the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2. However, the
HCHO selectivity obtained over the Fe-MCM-41-DHT catalyst
was still very low (ca. 15% at a 2% CH4 conversion).
We recently found that, as compared with MCM-41, SBA-15
was a better support for the loadings of MoOx [19], VOx [20,21]
and FePO4 [23] for the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2 due to its
larger pore diameter and more inert property without any acid
sites. Thus, here we ﬁrst compare the catalytic performances of
the Fe-SBA-15 prepared by the direct synthesis and the FeOx/
SBA-15 prepared by the impregnation. It should be noted that
only ca. 0.1 wt% Fe could be incorporated into SBA-15 by the

direct synthesis irrespective of the amount of iron added in the
synthesis mixture possibly because SBA-15 was prepared in a
strong acid medium [24].
Fig. 1 shows the diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra of the
Fe-SBA-15
and
the
FeOx/SBA-15
together
with
two
reference samples, the Fe-MFI zeolite (Si/Fe = 64) and a-
Fe2O3, in which iron atoms are in isolated tetrahedral and
aggregated octahedral states, respectively. Distinctly differ-
ent from a-Fe2O3, both the Fe-SBA-15 and the FeOx/SBA-15
did not show obvious absorption in visible region, indicating
that there were no a-Fe2O3 or heavily aggregated iron oxide
particles in these samples. The main difference of the two
iron-containing SBA-15 samples lies in the position of the
absorption edge, which reﬂects the bandgap energy (Eg), and
the Eg is related to the domain size (dispersion) and the
coordination structure of the transition metal oxides or ions
[25]. We have calculated the Eg values (Table 1) for the Fe–O
band from the UV–vis spectra using the method suggested by
Weber [25]. The result that the Eg value for the Fe-SBA-15 is
very close to that for the Fe-MFI while the Eg for the FeOx/
SBA-15 is lower indicates that the iron sites in the Fe-SBA-
15 are mostly isolated in the framework of SBA-15, whereas
the
FeOx/SBA-15
probably
contains
oligomeric
FeOx
clusters.
Fig. 2 shows the changes in HCHO selectivity as a function
of CH4 conversion obtained at 450–650 8C over the Fe-SBA-15
and the FeOx/SBA-15. In the whole range, the Fe-SBA-15
possessed higher HCHO selectivity than the FeOx/SBA-15 at a
certain CH4 conversion. This strongly suggests that the iron
sites isolated in the framework of SBA-15 are more selective
than the oligomeric FeOx clusters for the partial oxidation of
CH4 to HCHO by O2. This conclusion is consistent with that
achieved with the Fe-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT and the
TIE methods [22], but the HCHO selectivity over the Fe-SBA-
15 is remarkably higher than that over the Fe-MCM-41.
By optimizing the reaction conditions, we obtained a 2.1%
yield (single-pass) to HCHO with a selectivity of 52%, and
at
the
same
time,
the
HCHO
space

was
22.3 mmol g(cat)1 h1, affording a turnover frequency for
HCHO formation of 1245 mol (mol-Fe)1 h1.
3.2. Modiﬁcations of FeOx/SBA-15 with acid and alkaline
additives for partial oxidation of CH4 by O2
To
uncover
the
inﬂuences
of
the
acid
or
alkaline
environment of iron sites on their catalytic properties in the
partial oxidation of CH4, we investigated the effects of the
modiﬁcations of the FeOx/SBA-15 with various acid and
alkaline additives. We had chosen the FeOx/SBA-15 with an
iron content of 1 wt% for these investigations.
As shown in Fig. 3, in the plot of HCHO selectivity versus
CH4 conversion, the curves for all of the modiﬁed FeOx/SBA-
15 were above that for the FeOx/SBA-15 without an additive.
Thus, all the acid and alkaline additives investigated could
enhance the selectivity to HCHO. Among these additives, the
phosphate (expressed as P) was the best for HCHO formation.
For the alkali metal ion additives, HCHO selectivity decreased
with the sequence of Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+, indicating
that the alkaline property is detrimental to HCHO formation.
To clarify why these modiﬁed catalysts showed higher
HCHO selectivity than the FeOx/SBA-15, we carried out
diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectroscopic measurements for
these samples, and the Eg values of Fe–O band calculated are
listed in Table 1. The Eg increased signiﬁcantly for all of the
modiﬁed FeOx/SBA-15 samples except for the P-FeOx/SBA-
15, suggesting that the dispersion of iron species was raised by
most of these additives. Thus, the higher dispersion of iron
species in the presence of the additives led to the higher HCHO
selectivity.
Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of the acid additive-
modiﬁed FeOx/SBA-15 samples. The FeOx/SBA-15 without the
additive gave two main Raman bands at 982 and 1078 cm1 in
the region of 900–1200 cm1, possibly ascribed to the
dispersed iron species. These bands were not signiﬁcantly
changed for the S- and B-modiﬁed FeOx/SBA-15. However, for
the P-FeOx/SBA-15, the two bands shifted together and the
peak positions became similar to those for FePO4 at 1015 and

1059 cm1 arising from the alternatively connected tetrahedral
PO4 and FeO4 groups [18,23]. The FePO4 nanoclusters
encapsulated in MCM-41 [18] or SBA-15 [23] also exhibited
broadened and overlapped Raman bands as observed here.
Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that FePO4 nanoclusters
have been formed over the P-FeOx/SBA-15 sample. The
formation of FePO4 nanoclusters containing irons sites
surrounded by phosphate groups probably accounts for the
best catalytic performances of the P-FeOx/SBA-15 for HCHO
formation.
3.3. Partial oxidation of CH4 by N2O over the iron-
containing SBA-15 catalysts with and without modiﬁcations
Table 2 compares the catalytic performances of the Fe-SBA-
15 and the FeOx/SBA-15 for the partial oxidation of CH4 by
N2O. CH3OH was also formed in addition to HCHO over the
two catalysts on this occasion. It is unexpected that the Fe-
SBA-15 with tetrahedral iron sites in the framework of SBA-15
gives lower selectivities to CH3OH and HCHO than the FeOx/
SBA-15 containing oligomeric FeOx clusters at a similar CH4
conversion.
The catalytic performances of the 1 wt% FeOx/SBA-15
samples modiﬁed by the acid and alkaline additives are shown
in Fig. 5. Different from the results obtained using O2 as the
oxidant (Fig. 3), most of the additives did not exert signiﬁcant
positive effects on the selectivity to useful oxygenates. Only the
P-FeOx/SBA-15 was very unique in producing useful oxyge-
nates including CH3OH and HCHO with a high selectivity.
Thus, the FePO4 nanoclusters generated were probably very

special in the activation of N2O to produce the active oxygen
species accounting for the conversion of CH4 to CH3OH and
HCHO. It is also of interest to note that CH3OH can also be
formed when some alkaline additives are used, and the yield to
the oxygenates (CH3OH and HCHO) is slightly increased after
the modiﬁcation with K+. Thus, there is also a possibility of the
formation of peculiar iron sites capable of activating N2O in the
presence of K+.
3.4. Requirements for the epoxidation of propylene over
iron-containing mesoporous silica
We have found an interesting switching of allylic oxidation
to epoxidation during the oxidation of C3H6 by N2O when the
FeOx/SBA-15 catalyst is modiﬁed with an alkali metal salt
typiﬁed by KCl [26]. It is well known that the easy occurrence
of the allylic oxidation is the main obstacle for the epoxidation
of C3H6. Thus, the studies on the chemistry of this system are of
high signiﬁcance. Here we discuss some essential requirements
for the occurrence of the epoxidation of propylene over related
iron-containing catalysts.
To uncover whether iron is unique for the epoxidation of
C3H6 by N2O, we have examined many SBA-15-supported
transition metal oxides (1 wt%) with and without KCl
modiﬁcation for this reaction. As shown in Fig. 6, PO was
only formed over the 1 wt% Au/SBA-15 with a meaningful
selectivity in the absence of KCl modiﬁcation, but C3H6
conversion was very low (<0.1%). The modiﬁcation with KCl
caused the formation of PO over several catalysts. However, the
KCl-FeOx/SBA-15 exhibited remarkably higher PO selectivity
(84%) and higher C3H6 conversion (1.0%). Thus, iron is
peculiar for the epoxidation of C3H6 by N2O.
As described above, the modiﬁcation of the FeOx/SBA-15
with phosphate signiﬁcantly enhanced the formation of CH3OH
and HCHO in the partial oxidation of CH4 by N2O (Fig. 5). The
P-modiﬁed FeOx/SBA-15 catalyst was also applied for the
epoxidation of C3H6 by N2O. However, as shown in Table 3,
only a small amount of PO was obtained and the main partial
oxidation product was still acrolein over the P-FeOx/SBA-15.
On the other hand, the modiﬁcation of the FeOx/SBA-15 with
alkali metal salts such as KCl shifted the reaction route from
allylic oxidation to epoxidation. The increase in K/Fe ratio
from 1 to 5 also increased the C3H6 conversion remarkably
(Table 3). Thus, the alkali metal salt modiﬁer was vital for PO
formation. Using KCl as an example, we have recently clariﬁed
that the alkali metal salt plays the following pivotal roles [27]:
(1) increasing the dispersion of FeOx clusters probably via a
surface reaction between the ﬁnely dispersed FeOx and KCl; (2)
decreasing the reactivity of lattice oxygen associated with the
FeOx and thus suppressing the allylic oxidation; (3) eliminating
the surface acidity and thus keeping PO from isomerization.
It is of signiﬁcance to clarify whether O2 can be used as an
oxidant for C3H6 epoxidation over the modiﬁed iron-containing
catalysts. The catalytic results obtained with O2 instead of N2O
for the oxidation of C3H6 over the 1 wt% FeOx/SBA-15 with
and without KCl modiﬁcation are also shown in Table 3. Over
the 1 wt% FeOx/SBA-15 without KCl modiﬁcation, a higher
C3H6 conversion was obtained with O2, but the selectivity to the
main partial oxidation product, i.e., acrolein became lower as
compared with that with N2O. Unexpectedly, the modiﬁcation
of the FeOx/SBA-15 with KCl remarkably decreased the C3H6
conversion, and the KCl-FeOx/SBA-15 (K/Fe = 5) was almost

inactive for the conversion of C3H6 by O2. Moreover, the
selectivity to PO was not signiﬁcantly enhanced. Therefore, the
modiﬁed FeOx/SBA-15 could not function as a useful C3H6
epoxidation catalyst when O2 was used to replace N2O. In other
words, for the iron-catalyzed C3H6 epoxidation, the use of N2O
oxidant combined with an appropriately modiﬁed active iron
site is indispensable.
3.5. Comparisons between O2 and N2O as oxidant for
partial oxidation of CH4 and epoxidation of C3H6
As described above, signiﬁcant differences were observed in
catalytic behaviors when a different oxidant (i.e., O2 or N2O)
was used for the partial oxidation of CH4 or the epoxidation of
C3H6
over
iron-containing
heterogeneous
catalysts.
The
elucidation of the nature of such differences may be helpful
for the design of a highly active and selective catalytic system.
Here we make a preliminary discussion on this issue on the
basis of our current results and the known facts.
For the partial oxidation of CH4 with O2, HCHO was the only
partial oxidation product and no CH3OH could be detected over
our iron-containing catalysts. It was revealed that the higher
dispersion of iron species would result in higher HCHO
selectivity. For examples, the isolated iron sites in the framework
of a mesoporous silica were better than the FeOx clusters; both
the acid and alkaline additives enhanced HCHO selectivity
because of the increased dispersion of iron species in the
presence of these additives although the environment of iron also
affected the catalytic performances. When N2O was used for the
partial oxidation of CH4 over our iron-containing catalysts,
CH3OH was also formed in addition to HCHO. On the basis of
our previous comparative studies on the partial oxidation of CH4
over MCM-41-supported FePO4 catalysts [18], we propose that,
different from the case using O2 where a redox mechanism via
lattice oxygenis responsiblefortheconversion of CH4 to HCHO,
a special adsorbed active oxygen generated on a special iron site
accounts for the conversion of CH4 to CH3OH and HCHO using
N2O. In the latter case, the FeOx clusters located on the wall
surface of a mesoporous silica worked more efﬁciently than the
framework iron sites. For the oxidation of benzene to phenolwith
N2O catalyzed by the Fe-ZSM-5, it is generally accepted that the
extraframework iron is responsible for the activation of N2O
[28,29]. It is thus possible that the framework iron sites are
difﬁcult to activate N2O to generate the peculiar active oxygen
species although we do not know whether the active oxygen
species in our case resembles that for benzene to phenol.
Moreover, among many modiﬁed FeOx/SBA-15 catalysts, only
the P-FeOx/SBA-15 exhibited uniquely higher selectivity and
yield to CH3OH and HCHO in the case of using N2O. We
speculate that the FePO4 nanoclusters formed in the mesopores
of SBA-15 arevery uniquefor theactivation of N2O to the special
active oxygen species. The K-FeOx/SBA-15 also enhanced the
formation of CH3OH in the case of using N2O.
For the oxidation of C3H6, PO could not be formed or was
only a minor product when O2 was used over any of our iron-
containing catalysts. The allylic oxidation by nucleophilic
oxygen species (lattice oxygen) must proceed rapidly in the
presence of O2. On the other hand, by using N2O, PO could be
obtained with high selectivities (>70%) over an appropriately
modiﬁed iron-containing catalyst. We can expect that the
activation of N2O may generate a special oxygen species with
electrophilic characteristic on the iron site. However, the
modiﬁcation with an alkali metal salt typiﬁed by KCl is
necessary for the formation of the active iron sites. Further
elucidations of the active iron sites and the active oxygen
species are still needed in future studies.
4. Conclusions
The location, dispersion and environment (acidic or alkaline)
of iron sites and the nature of oxidant are key factors in
determining the catalytic performances of iron-containing
mesoporous materials for selective oxidation reactions. For
the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2, a higher dispersion of iron
sites is required for obtaining a higher selectivity to HCHO. The
alkaline is detrimental to HCHO selectivity. On the other hand,
HCHO selectivity can be remarkably enhanced by the formation
of FePO4 clusters, in which the tetrahedral iron sites are
surrounded by the acidic phosphate groups. In the case of CH4
oxidation by N2O, the catalyst with FePO4 clusters is unique in
achieving high selectivity to CH3OH and HCHO. The location of
iron is vital in the case of using N2O, and the catalyst containing
framework iron exhibits poorer catalytic performances for the
oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH and HCHO. The use of N2O oxidant
is necessary for the epoxidation of C3H6 over the iron-containing
catalysts. Iron is peculiar for obtaining high selectivities to PO,
and the modiﬁcation of the iron sites with an alkali metal salt is
also required for the occurrence of C3H6 epoxidation.
