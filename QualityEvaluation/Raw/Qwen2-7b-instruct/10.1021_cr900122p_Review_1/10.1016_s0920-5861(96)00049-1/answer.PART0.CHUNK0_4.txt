[1] "On pure silica and low and medium loaded (2 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO,and MoO,/SiO,catalysts the MPO proceeds via a concerted mechanism without participation of lattice oxygen."
[2] "On highly loaded ( > 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO,and MoOJSiO,catalysts as well as on bulk V,O,and MOO, systems the two-step redox mechanism, involving the direct participation of lattice oxygen,is predominant."
[3] "No relationship between density of reduced sites and catalytic activity is found indicating then that the interaction of gas-phase oxygen with the catalyst surface does not lead to the formation of active surface oxygen species,resulting instead in a quickly incorporation of 0, into oxide lattice."

1. On pure silica and low to medium loaded vanadium-oxygen and molybdenum-oxygen catalysts, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) occurs through a concerted mechanism, without the involvement of lattice oxygen.
2. For highly loaded vanadium-oxygen and molybdenum-oxygen catalysts, as well as bulk vanadium-oxygen and molybdenum oxide systems, a two-step redox mechanism is predominant, featuring direct participation of lattice oxygen.
3. There is no correlation found between the density of reduced sites and catalytic activity, suggesting that the interaction of gas-phase oxygen with the catalyst surface doesn't generate active surface oxygen species, but instead leads to quick incorporation of oxygen into the oxide lattice.

1. 对于纯二氧化硅以及负载在2到5 wt%之间的五氧化二钒和五氧化二钼催化剂，烷烃氧化脱氢反应通过协同机制进行，不涉及晶格氧。
2. 对于高负载（>5 wt%）的五氧化二钒和五氧化二钼催化剂，以及纯的五氧化二钒和五氧化二钼系统，两步还原氧化机制占主导地位，直接涉及到晶格氧的参与。
3. 没有发现密度减少位点与催化活性之间的关系，这表明气体相氧与催化剂表面的相互作用没有形成活性表面氧物种，相反导致氧迅速融入氧化物晶格中。
