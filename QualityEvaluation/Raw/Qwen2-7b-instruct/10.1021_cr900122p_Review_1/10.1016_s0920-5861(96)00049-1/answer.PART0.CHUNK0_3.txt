[1] "The direct participation of the lattice oxygen proves the occurrence of a step-wise redox mechanism while the involvement of the surface activated gas-phase 0, probes a concerted or a two-site surface reaction path."
[2] "As it has been ascertained that the catalytic behaviour of silica supported MOO, and V,O,catalysts is controlled by the extent of oxide loading."
[3] "Indeed, the direct participation of the lattice oxygen proves the occurrence of a step-wise redox mechanism while the involvement of the surface activated gas-phase 0,probes a concerted or a two-site surface reaction path."
[4] "On pure silica and low and medium loaded (2 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO,and MoO,/SiO,catalysts the MPO proceeds via a concerted mechanism without participation of lattice oxygen."
[5] "On highly loaded ( > 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO,and MoOJSiO,catalysts as well as on bulk V,O,and MOO, systems the two-step redox mechanism, involving the direct participation of lattice oxygen,is predominant."

1. The presence of lattice oxygen in the reaction mixture indicates the occurrence of a step-wise redox mechanism, while the activation of gas-phase oxygen on the surface suggests a concerted or two-site surface reaction pathway.
2. The behavior of silica supported MOO, and V,O,catalysts is influenced by the amount of oxide loading.
3. Direct involvement of lattice oxygen confirms a step-wise redox mechanism, whereas the activation of gas-phase oxygen on the surface points towards a concerted or two-site surface reaction path.
4. For low to moderate loading (2-5 wt%) of V,O,/SiO, and MoO,/SiO,catalysts on pure silica, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde proceeds via a concerted mechanism without the participation of lattice oxygen.
5. High loading (greater than 5 wt%) of V,O,/SiO, and MoOJSiO,catalysts, as well as bulk V,O, and MOO, systems predominantly exhibit a two-step redox mechanism, involving direct participation of lattice oxygen.

1. 棱晶氧的直接参与证明了分步还原氧化机制的存在，而表面激活的气相氧则表明了协同或双位点表面反应路径。
2. 对于硅基支持的MOO, 和V,O,催化剂的行为受氧化物负载量的影响。
3. 直接涉及棱晶氧证实了分步还原氧化机制的存在，而表面激活的气相氧指向了协同或双位点表面反应路径。
4. 对于2-5 wt%的低至中等负载（2-5 wt%）的V,O,/SiO,和MoO,/SiO催化剂在纯硅上，甲烷部分氧化为甲醛通过协同机制进行，不涉及棱晶氧的参与。
5. 高负载（大于5 wt%）的V,O,/SiO,和MoOJSiO催化剂，以及纯V,O,和MOO,系统主要表现出两步还原氧化机制，直接涉及到棱晶氧。
