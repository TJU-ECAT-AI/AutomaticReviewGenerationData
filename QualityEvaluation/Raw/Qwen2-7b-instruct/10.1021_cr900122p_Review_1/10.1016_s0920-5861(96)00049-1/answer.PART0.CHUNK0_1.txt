[1] "Notwithstanding the great research effort, the working mechanism of bulk and supported oxide catalysts in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen (MPO) still remains undecided."
[2] "As the attempts made to elucidate the oxygen insertion pathway under steady-state conditions resulted not completely convincing [3,6], a valid and alternative approach which could contribute to shed light into this issue is that based on the evaluation of the reaction rate in the mixture of reactants (CH, + 0,) and in the absence of gas-phase 0,[li]."
[3] "Indeed, the direct participation of the lattice oxygen proves the occurrence of a step- wise redox mechanism while the involvement of the surface activated gas-phase 0,probes a concerted or a two-site surface reaction path [14]."
[4] "It results that the value of R increases steadily up to a V,O,loading of 20%, thereafter it levels off to a value of ca. 0.6 for VPS 20, VPS 50 and bulk V samples."
[5] "From the above data (Table 3) it arises that the increase in the V,O, loading implies the shift of the reaction pathway from concerted to redox mechanism with a remark- able decrease in the overall catalytic activity."
[6] "On pure silica and low and medium loaded (2 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO,and MoO,/SiO,catalysts the MPO proceeds via a concerted mechanism without participation of lattice oxygen."
[7] "On highly loaded ( > 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO,and MoOJSiO,catalysts as well as on bulk V,O,and MOO, systems the two-step redox mecha- nism, involving the direct participation of lattice oxygen,is predominant."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, presents significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. The document highlights the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. For low and medium loaded (2-5 wt%) V,O,/SiO, and MoO,/SiO, catalysts, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde proceeds via a concerted mechanism without the involvement of lattice oxygen. This indicates the critical role of gas-phase oxygen activation in the main reaction pathway, as evidenced by the direct correlation between the density of reduced sites and activity.

However, on highly loaded (≥5 wt%) V,O,/SiO, and MoO,/SiO, catalysts as well as on bulk V,O, and MOO, systems, the two-step redox mechanism, involving the direct participation of lattice oxygen, predominates. The document also discusses the lack of a direct relationship between density of reduced sites and catalytic activity on these highly loaded catalysts, suggesting that the interaction of gas-phase oxygen with the catalyst surface does not lead to the formation of active surface oxygen species, instead resulting in a quick incorporation of oxygen into the oxide lattice. This highlights the importance of understanding the reaction mechanisms and the impact of catalyst loading on the efficiency of the process.

The collective influence of these factors on process efficiency is multifaceted, encompassing the optimization of catalyst loading, the design of supported systems to isolate active sites, and the precise control over the redox processes. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is emphasized, as it allows for the prevention of unwanted side reactions and enhances the formation of desired products. This holistic approach to catalyst development and process engineering is crucial for advancing the field of ODH and improving the sustainability and economic viability of alkane conversion technologies.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，不同催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统）之间的相互作用在实现高选择性和转化率方面存在重大挑战。文献强调了在解决选择性问题时隔离活性位点的作用。对于低和中负载（2-5 wt%）的V,O,/SiO,和MoO,/SiO,催化剂，甲烷的部分氧化到甲醛通过协同机制进行，不涉及晶格氧。这表明气相氧激活在主要反应途径中的关键作用，如密度降低站点与活性之间的直接相关性所证实的那样。

然而，在高负载（≥5 wt%）的V,O,/SiO,和MoO,/SiO,催化剂以及块状V,O,和MOO,系统上，两步还原机制占主导地位，直接参与晶格氧。文献还讨论了在这些高负载催化剂上，密度降低站点与催化活性之间不存在直接关系的事实，暗示了气相氧与催化剂表面的相互作用不会形成活性表面氧物种，而是导致氧气迅速融入氧化物晶格中。这凸显了理解反应机制和催化剂负载对过程效率影响的重要性。

这些因素集体对过程效率的影响是多方面的，包括优化催化剂负载、设计支持系统以隔离活性位点以及精确控制还原过程。在解决选择性问题时，隔离活性位点的作用被强调，这有助于防止不必要的副反应并增强所需产物的形成。这种全面的方法对于推动ODH领域的发展并提高烷烃转换技术的可持续性和经济可行性至关重要。
