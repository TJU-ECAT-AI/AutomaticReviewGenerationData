[1] "The CuTh oxide catalysts were obtained by calcination of the coprecipitated copper and thorium hydroxides at 1073 K for 5 h in a flow of dried air. Samples with different Cu/Th atomic ratios were prepared."
[2] "The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane or propane was carried out at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor atmospheric pressure using a mixture composition of 6:3:91 for C2(or C3):O2:He."
[3] "The A I and A 2 signal intensities reached a maximum for a low copper content (Cu/Th < 0.i) and disappeared rapidly before the atomic ratio reached 0.25."
[4] "On the other hand, the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
[5] "In our case the highest value of K has been estimated at 0.033 for Cu/Th=0.1."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves interactions between various catalysts, particularly focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, which typically involve C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it affects how effectively the catalysts can activate alkyl groups while inhibiting unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by the balance between these factors. For instance, at lower copper-to-thorium ratios (Cu/Th < 0.1), higher conversions of propane and better selectivities for propene are observed. However, at higher copper contents, the selectivity in propene decreases due to the formation of CuO crystallites, which limit the conversion. The reaction mechanism suggests that the selectivity in propene can be attributed to Cu2+ ions localized in substitutional sites, rather than other sites, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process.

烷烃氧化脱氢过程涉及各种催化剂之间的交互作用，特别是关注于单质金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于反应的复杂性，通常涉及C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体和2H-摘除。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中扮演关键角色，因为它影响催化剂有效激活烷基团的能力，同时抑制不必要的副反应。该过程效率受到这些因素之间平衡的影响。例如，在较低铜/钍比（Cu/Th < 0.1）下，丙烷的更高转化率和更好的丙烯选择性被观察到。然而，在更高的铜含量下，丙烯的选择性降低，这是由于CuO晶粒的形成限制了转化。反应机制表明，丙烯的选择性可能归因于位于取代位点的Cu2+离子，而不是其他位点，这有助于整体过程效率。
