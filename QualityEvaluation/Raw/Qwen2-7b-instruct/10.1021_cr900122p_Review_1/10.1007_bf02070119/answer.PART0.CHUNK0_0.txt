Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the pivotal role of catalysts, specifically focusing on CuTh oxide catalysts. The selectivity and conversion challenges are deeply intertwined with the nature of the catalysts, particularly the distribution of active sites. The Cu/Th atomic ratio significantly influences the catalyst's performance, affecting both the efficiency of the process and the selectivity in product formation. The document suggests that the presence of CuO crystallites limits the conversion at high copper contents, while the selectivity in ethylene is more pronounced with copper(II) sites. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu2+ ions on the surface, though the selectivity in propene shows a decrease as the conversion increases, akin to findings by Kung and Volta. The selectivity of propene is further explained through a reaction mechanism involving the rate constants of dehydrogenation and oxidation, indicating a complex interplay between reactivity and selectivity in ODH processes.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，文献着重讨论了催化剂的作用，特别是CuTh氧化物催化剂。选择性和转化率的挑战与催化剂的性质紧密相关，尤其是活性位点的分布情况。Cu/Th原子比显著影响催化剂性能，影响过程效率和产物选择性。文献表明，在高铜含量下，CuO晶粒的存在限制了转化率，而乙烯的选择性则更多地与铜(II)位点相关。对于丙烷，其催化活性归因于表面的Cu2+离子，尽管随着转化率的增加，丙烯的选择性有所下降，这与Kung和Volta的研究结果类似。丙烯的选择性通过脱氢和氧化反应速率常数的机制进一步解释，显示了ODH过程中反应性和选择性的复杂相互作用。
