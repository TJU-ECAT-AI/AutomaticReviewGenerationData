1. The CuTh oxide catalysts were synthesized through calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides at 1073 K for 5 hours in a dried air flow. 
2. Different atomic ratios of Cu/Th were used in the preparation of these catalysts.
3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane occurred at 823 K within a dynamic flow microreactor under atmospheric pressure, utilizing a C2(C3):O2:He mixture at a 6:3:91 ratio.
4. The conversion of ethane and propane into ethylene and propene, respectively, is significantly influenced by the presence of copper in thoria.
5. The selectivity for ethylene production increases with copper content, but decreases when the Cu/Th atomic ratio surpasses 0.25.
6. The conversion of propane shows a direct correlation with copper concentration in ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is below 0.25, while it remains stable for higher atomic ratios.
7. The selectivity for propene production rises sharply with copper content, reaching a peak at Cu/Th = 0.1, and subsequently declines for greater atomic ratios.

1. 铜钍氧化物催化剂通过将铜和钍氢氧化物在1073 K下进行5小时的煅烧，在干燥空气流中制备。
2. 不同的Cu/Th原子比用于这些催化剂的制备。
3. 在823 K下的动态流动微反应器中，以大气压力进行乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢作用，使用C2(C3):O2:He混合物，比例为6:3:91。
4. 乙烷和丙烷转化为乙烯和丙烯的过程，与钍中的铜的存在密切相关。
5. 乙烯的产率随铜含量增加而增加，但在Cu/Th原子比超过0.25时减少。
6. 当Cu/Th原子比低于0.25时，丙烷的转化与ThO2中的铜浓度直接相关，而对于更高的原子比则保持稳定。
7. 丙烯的选择性随着铜含量的增加而迅速提高，达到峰值Cu/Th = 0.1，并且在更高的原子比下逐渐下降。
