[1] "Through judicious analysis of XRD, ND, HREM, SEM data, as well as, application of sound chemical concepts, theory and analysis of catalytic data, the structure and composition of the active centers of M1 and M2 phases of MoV(Nb,Ta)TeO catalysts were determined. All catalytic functionalities of the active and selective centers, as well as, waste forming centers, could be assigned to specific metals."
[2] "Symbiosis between M1 and M2 mixtures was demonstrated for propane ammoxidation and conditions for its occurrence defined. Phase cooperation occurs with one-pot in situ synthesized phase mixtures, as well as with separately prepared phases that are physically mixed post synthesis."
[3] "Redox behavior of MoVNbTeO catalysts was observed and defined. Redox driven interactions of the active centers between the surface and the bulk could be ascertained and mechanistically interpreted. M1 crystals could be reduced with C3H8 + NH3 pulses, whereby up to 70 layers were involved in the reduction process."
[4] "The possible role which dislocations, if at all present, might play in the catalysis of MoV(Nb,Ta)(Te,Sb)O solids remains unanswered at this junction."
[5] "A focused, well thought out and intelligent combinatorial methodology program should be initiated with the aim of scanning substantial regions of the periodic table to identify new chemical compositions for selective paraffin activation and their subsequent selective (amm)oxidation."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), several factors influence process efficiency, including the interplay between catalysts, selectivity, conversion rates, and reaction mechanisms. Catalysts, particularly bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in activating C-H bonds, creating M-alkyl intermediates, and facilitating 2H-abstraction reactions. Site isolation, ensuring that active sites are distinct from one another, helps address selectivity issues by preventing unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of ODH processes hinges on achieving high selectivity and conversion, which often requires a careful balance among catalyst composition, support material, and reaction conditions. The role of dislocations in the catalytic activity of MoV(Nb,Ta)(Te,Sb)O solids is not yet clear, suggesting that further research might uncover new insights. To advance ODH technology, a strategic combinatorial approach targeting diverse regions of the periodic table could potentially lead to the discovery of new catalysts with improved performance.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，多个因素共同影响过程效率，包括催化剂之间的相互作用、选择性和转化率以及反应机制。特别是，多相金属氧化物和负载系统在激活C-H键、形成M-烷基中间体并促进2H脱氢反应中起着关键作用。通过确保活性位点彼此隔离，可以有效解决选择性问题，避免不必要的副反应发生。ODH过程的效率取决于实现高选择性和转化率，这通常需要对催化剂组成、支持材料和反应条件进行精确平衡。至于MoV(Nb,Ta)(Te,Sb)O固体中的位错是否在催化作用中发挥作用，目前尚不清楚，这表明进一步的研究可能揭示新的见解。为了推进ODH技术的发展，一个有策略、周密考虑的组合方法程序，目标是扫描元素周期表的广泛区域，以识别具有选择性烷烃活化的新化学组成及其随后的选择性氧化，这可能会发现性能改进的新催化剂。
