Answer: 
1. The active center on the basal plane (001) of M1 phase of MoVNbTeO catalysts contains a V5 + site, which the M2 phase lacks. The presence of V5 + sites alone is insufficient for catalysis, as the sites must also be adjacent to a heptagonal channel through which the paraffin enters during activation.

2. The key to effective catalysis lies not only in the presence of V5 + sites but also in their location near a heptagonal channel in the catalyst structure. This facilitates the activation of paraffins.

3. The active centers of M1 are situated on the surface of their basal planes (001) and feature all essential catalytic functionalities aligned within a bonding distance to enable the direct conversion of propane to acrylonitrile.

4. Te4 + in the M2 phase, analogous to Bi3 + in BiMoO systems, serves to provide a lone pair of electrons for C-H bond activation. 

5. M2 lacks both V5 + sites and heptagonal channels, making it incapable of activating paraffins. 

6. M1 is reducible by propane and ammonia in the absence of dioxygen, and it can be restored to its original, fully oxidized state by dioxygen (air).

7. Redox experiments were carried out by periodically exposing the catalyst to propane and ammonia pulses. 

8. After 6 pulses of propane and ammonia, approximately 14 layers of the catalyst are reduced, equating to 0.46% of the total lattice oxygen being removed.

1.MoVNbTeO催化剂的基面（001）上的活性中心包含一个V5 +位点，而M2相中不具有此位点。仅存在V5 +位点并不足以实现催化作用，还需要这些位点位于可让烷烃至少部分进入的七边形通道附近。

2.有效的催化作用不仅需要V5 +位点的存在，还需要这些位点靠近催化剂结构中的七边形通道，以促进烷烃的活化。

3. M1相的活性中心位于其基面表面，并且所有必需的催化功能排列在相互接近的距离内，能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯腈。

4. M2相中，类似于BiMoO系统中的Bi3 +，Te4 +提供了一对孤对电子用于C-H键的活化。

5. M2缺乏V5 +位点和七边形通道，因此无法激活烷烃。

6. M1可以在无氧的情况下被丙烷和氨还原，并可以通过空气中的氧气恢复到完全氧化的原始状态。

7. 通过周期性地向催化剂施加丙烷和氨脉冲进行了还原实验。

8. 在6个丙烷和氨脉冲后，大约有14层催化剂被还原，相当于总共移除了0.46%的晶格氧。
