ODH, or oxidative dehydrogenation, transforms alkanes into alkenes using catalysts like bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is difficult due to the complexity of the reactions involved. Catalyst efficiency is affected by the activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms. Site isolation is vital for improving selectivity in ODH processes. By understanding the reaction mechanisms and refining catalyst characteristics, the efficiency of ODH can be enhanced.
