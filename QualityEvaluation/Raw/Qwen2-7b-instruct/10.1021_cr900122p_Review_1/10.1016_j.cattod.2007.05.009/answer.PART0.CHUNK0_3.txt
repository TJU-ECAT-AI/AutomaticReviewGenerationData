[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[6] "This implies that while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH,better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[8] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[9] "Some significant points concerning the reactivity of these systems are:"
[10] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[11] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[12] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[13] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,5175]."
[14] "Evidence has been reported indicating that the O atom bridging V to the support may be the one participating in the catalytic cycle in isolated V species."
[15] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41 [49,100,106111], MCM-48 [112] or SBA-15 [112115]."
[16] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[17] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."
[18] "In the case of molybdena-based systems:"
[19] "In alumina-supported samples, alumina contributes to the primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of ethane to COx and coke respectively, which proceed effectively over the acidic centers. The molybdena phase is involved in the ODH of ethane and the secondary overoxidation of ethylene to COx [120]."
[20] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181,187,189,263269]."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a pivotal role in determining the process efficiency. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are intertwined with the properties of these catalysts. For instance, the reactivity of vanadium oxide catalysts is influenced by the vanadia surface density and domain size, impacting the selectivity to olefins. The Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism and the dissociation of CH bonds are key in the activation of alkyl species, leading to olefin formation. Site isolation is critical in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for the development of catalysts with large concentrations of accessible, isolated active sites. This is exemplified by the VOx-SBA-15 system, which provides a high concentration of such sites, leading to superior performance in propane ODH. Moreover, the role of the support cannot be overstated, as it influences the redox properties of the catalysts. Combinatorial and parallel systems, utilizing advanced algorithms, have contributed significantly to the discovery of new catalysts, enhancing our understanding and capabilities in ODH technology.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，我们可以看到各种催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和负载型系统，在决定这一过程效率方面起着关键作用。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战与这些催化剂的特性紧密相关。例如，范德华氧化物催化剂的活性受范德华表面密度和域大小的影响，影响了烯烃的选择性。火星-范克雷文还原机制和CH键的断裂是激活烷基物种并导致烯烃形成的关键。位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面至关重要，因为它允许开发具有大量可访问、孤立活性位点的催化剂。以VOx-SBA-15系统为例，它提供了高浓度这样的位点，在丙烷ODH中表现出优异性能。此外，支持的作用不容忽视，因为它影响催化剂的还原性质。组合和并行系统，利用先进的算法，对新催化剂的发现做出了重大贡献，极大地增强了我们对ODH技术的理解和能力。
