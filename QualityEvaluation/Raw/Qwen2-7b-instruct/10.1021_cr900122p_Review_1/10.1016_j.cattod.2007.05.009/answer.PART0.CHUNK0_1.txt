[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe."
[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry."
[6] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[7] "In the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[8] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[10] "In the case of propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[11] "In contrast with the above-mentioned findings, the results obtained by Lemonidou and co-workers [27] showed that in titania and zirconia-supported vanadium oxide, the ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane weakens when increasing VOx density."
[12] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+ [2225,28,46]."
[13] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,5175]."
[14] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[15] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, particularly ethane and propane, faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a critical role in the process efficiency. Challenges include thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion, coking causing rapid catalyst deactivation, and the need for high energy efficiency. Achieving economic attractiveness requires efficient catalysts with high activity and selectivity. Site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues by isolating active sites, thus enhancing the efficiency of the ODH process.

In the ODH of light alkanes, the effectiveness of catalysts lies in their ability to convert alkanes to olefins with high selectivity and yield. The use of catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide is common, with varying results depending on the catalyst's structure and composition. The ability of vanadium to activate the C-H bond varies with the density of vanadia species on the catalyst surface. Different catalyst supports, such as titania and zirconia, can influence the selectivity and efficiency of the ODH process. The extent of vanadium reduction during the ODH process is lower than expected, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The support plays a significant role in determining the catalyst's reactivity, with factors like the support's electronegativity influencing the catalyst's performance. Advanced catalysts, such as those incorporating acid sites, redox sites, or microporous materials, show promise in enhancing selectivity and efficiency in the ODH of ethane and propane.

Site isolation is a critical factor in addressing selectivity issues in the ODH process. By isolating active sites, the catalyst can more efficiently convert alkanes to olefins while maintaining high selectivity. This approach can lead to more efficient and economically attractive processes for the production of olefins from alkanes.

烷烃（特别是乙烷和丙烷）的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程在实现高选择性和转化率时面临多个挑战。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，在过程效率中起着关键作用。面临的挑战包括热力学约束限制烷烃转化、焦化导致催化剂快速失活以及高能效的需要。实现经济吸引力需要高效催化剂，具有高活性和选择性。位点隔离是解决选择性问题的关键，通过隔离活性位点，可以提高ODH过程的效率。

在轻烷烃的ODH过程中，催化剂的有效性在于其将烷烃转化为烯烃的高选择性和产量。基于支持态钒氧化物的催化剂通常被使用，但根据催化剂的结构和组成，结果会有所不同。钒激活C-H键的能力随催化剂表面范德亚物种密度的变化而变化。不同的催化剂支持，如二氧化钛和二氧化锆，可以影响ODH过程的选择性和效率。在ODH过程中，钒的减少程度低于预期，影响催化剂的活性和选择性。支持对催化剂反应性的影响显著，支持的电负性等参数会影响催化剂的性能。先进催化剂，如引入酸性位点、还原位点或微孔材料的催化剂，显示出增强选择性和效率的潜力，在乙烷和丙烷的ODH过程中。

位点隔离是解决ODH过程选择性问题的关键因素。通过隔离活性位点，催化剂可以更有效地将烷烃转化为烯烃，同时保持高选择性。这种方法可能导致从烷烃到烯烃生产过程更加高效和经济。
