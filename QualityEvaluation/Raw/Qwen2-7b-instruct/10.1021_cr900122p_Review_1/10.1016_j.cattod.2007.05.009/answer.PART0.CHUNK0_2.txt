[1] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."
[2] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[3] "In the case of supported vanadium oxide, in propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[4] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[5] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[6] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acid-basic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[7] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[8] "For each catalyst, the best olefin yield value is given, obtained in correspondence to a set value of conversion and selectivity."
[9] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process include the balance between catalyst activity and accessibility of reactants, the kinetic relevance of CH bond dissociation, and the redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen. Site isolation is pivotal in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that active sites remain isolated and accessible, thereby enhancing the overall process efficiency. Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity due to the balance between surface VOx species activity and their accessibility. The use of additives modifies acid-basic and redox properties, further influencing catalytic performance. The presence of acid sites and redox sites in catalysts like VCoAPO-18 is essential for achieving high selectivities in ethane ODH. The comparative analysis of catalyst performance reveals the importance of conversion and selectivity in determining olefin yield, with the majority of catalysts reporting ethylene yields below 20% for ethane ODH. Site isolation strategies and the optimization of catalyst properties are critical in advancing the efficiency and selectivity of ODH processes.
