[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies,carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."
[5] "In the case of molybdena-based systems: 1. In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
[6] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
[7] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[8] "For each catalyst, the best olefin yield value is given, obtained in correspondence to a set value of conversion and selectivity."
[9] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in determining the process efficiency. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through detailed understanding of catalyst properties, such as the degree of agglomeration, acid-base characteristics, valence state of metal cations, and collective electronic properties of the solid. The reactivity of these systems is influenced by factors like the feed ratio between oxygen and alkane, which can dynamically modify the active surface and affect reaction mechanisms.

Site isolation, a key factor in catalyst design, enhances the efficiency of ODH by isolating active sites and minimizing side reactions. This approach is particularly effective in maintaining high selectivities towards desired products, such as ethylene and propylene, by preventing the deep oxidation of these compounds.

The performance of catalysts is closely tied to their ability to activate C-H bonds through the formation of alkoxides or other surface intermediates. The presence of acid sites and redox sites, as seen in VCoAPO-18, contributes to high selectivities for ethylene during ethane ODH.

Comparative studies highlight that catalysts producing outstanding olefin yields are essential for convincing companies to adopt ODH technologies. The use of advanced catalyst selection methods, such as combinatorial/parallel systems and genetic algorithms, has significantly expanded the pool of available catalytic systems, leading to the discovery of novel and efficient catalysts for ODH.

The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is pivotal in optimizing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, ensuring the production of desired olefins with high efficiency and selectivity.
