The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves various catalysts, both bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to convert alkanes into olefins. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the intricate interplay between these factors. Catalysts based on vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide are commonly studied, with each exhibiting unique characteristics affecting their performance. For instance, in propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts peaks at a certain loading, balancing between surface vanadia species' activity and accessibility to reactants. Selectivity to the corresponding olefins is optimized at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. 

Mechanisms of C-H bond activation and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates are central to understanding the reaction pathways. A Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation, is consistent across both propane and ethane ODH. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state ODH is notably lower than stoichiometric reduction, and only a fraction of reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers. 

The support plays a crucial role in the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, influencing both the extent of propane combustion and the selectivity to propylene formation. Various studies suggest that the identity of the support can significantly affect the reaction parameters. These insights collectively impact the process efficiency by influencing the selectivity and conversion rates. Site isolation strategies, such as isomorphous substitution of active metal species into microporous and mesoporous materials, aim to enhance selectivity by isolating active sites, thereby addressing the selectivity issues encountered in traditional catalyst systems.

氧化脱氢（ODH）是将烷烃转化为烯烃的一种复杂过程，涉及到各种催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于这些因素之间的复杂相互作用。基于钒氧化物和钼氧化物的催化剂通常受到研究，每种都具有影响其性能的独特特征。例如，在丙烷ODH中，支持型钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性在一定负载时达到峰值，平衡了表面钒化物种的活性和反应物的可接近性。对应烯烃的选择性优化在活性相负载的中间值处，对应于单层结构的发展。

C-H键激活和M-烷基中间体的形成是理解反应途径的核心机制。火星-范克雷文还原机制，涉及晶格氧在C-H键激活中的作用，对丙烷和乙烷ODH均一致。稳态ODH过程中钒的减少程度远低于化学计量比下的还原，只有部分还原中心在催化周转中是活跃的。

支撑在烷烃ODH中的活性方面发挥着关键作用，影响丙烷燃烧的程度和丙烯选择性形成。各种研究表明，支撑的性质可以显著影响反应参数。这些见解共同影响过程效率，通过影响选择性和转化率。

隔离策略，如将活性金属物种嵌入微孔和介孔材料中进行同晶取代，旨在通过隔离活性位点来增强选择性，从而解决传统催化剂系统遇到的选择性问题。
