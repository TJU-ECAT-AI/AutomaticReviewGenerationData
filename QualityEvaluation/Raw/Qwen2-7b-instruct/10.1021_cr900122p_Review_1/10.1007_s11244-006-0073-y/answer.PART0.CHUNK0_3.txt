[1] "Among the most efficient catalytic systems, four are examined: VPO, Ti(Zr)PO, VSbO and MoVTeNbO."
[2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
[3] "All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Bro nsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O) or O2 )."
[4] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
[5] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
[6] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
[7] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34]."
[8] "It can be observed that both sites show the presence of V5 +, which is sup- ported by many experimental data."
[9] "There has been no spectroscopic evidence of O) on vanadium pyrophosphate. It is probable that for the site described, a dipolar interaction between the paramag- netic centers (O)O) or O)V4 +) prevented their observation by EPR."
[10] "They have been shown to modify the V4+/V5+ ratio as well as the P/V ratio but no direct interpretation of the effect on the catalytic sites has been proposed although enhancement or decrease of the catalyst activity are observed."
[11] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
[12] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
[13] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
[14] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers. The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
[15] "In several cases, superoxo and peroxo species can be present at the surface and generate active catalytic sites."
[16] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species and that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72] and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov et al. [73]."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves understanding the complex interplay between catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, and the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability of catalysts to activate C-H bonds effectively, generate M-alkyl intermediates, and perform subsequent reactions with high specificity.

Catalysts like VPO, Ti(Zr)PO, VSbO, and MoVTeNbO provide unique mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation, overcoming the initial activation step. Activation sites with properties like strong Bronsted acidity, Lewis acidity, or electrophilicity play crucial roles in this process. The rupture of a methylene C-H bond is a critical step in the activation of n-butane, as shown by kinetic isotope effect studies.

Thermodynamic considerations suggest the involvement of reactive oxygen species, particularly in the activation of light alkanes. The presence of lattice oxygen demonstrates that it can be activated without external oxygen, contributing significantly to the oxygenated products. The existence of vanadium sites with specific vacancies or excess oxygen anions contributes to the catalytic activity, although their direct impact on the reaction mechanism is not always clear.

Dopants like cobalt can enhance catalyst activity by altering the V4+/V5+ ratio and surface atom distribution, indicating the importance of site isolation and the modification of surface properties. The presence of superoxo and peroxo species suggests additional pathways for activation, highlighting the potential for diverse catalytic mechanisms.

The role of oxygen species, especially O), in the activation process is acknowledged, but their exact contribution and the mechanisms involved require further theoretical studies to fully understand. The stabilization of active species through site isolation, as proposed by Gleaves and Panov, underscores the importance of structural defects in catalysis.

In summary, the efficiency of ODH relies on the development of catalysts capable of overcoming activation barriers, generating and stabilizing active intermediates, and maintaining high selectivity. Understanding the specific roles of various catalyst components and the stabilization mechanisms of reactive oxygen species is essential for advancing the field.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及到理解催化剂，如纯金属氧化物和支持体系之间的复杂相互作用，以及在实现高选择性和转化率方面的挑战。过程效率受到有效激活C-H键、生成M-烷基中间体以及进行高度特定后续反应的能力的影响。

像VPO、Ti(Zr)PO、VSbO和MoVTeNbO这样的催化剂提供了独特的机制来激活碳氢化合物，克服初始激活步骤。具有强布郎斯特酸性、Lewis酸性或亲电性的激活位点在这一过程中扮演着关键角色。甲基亚烷基C-H键的断裂是n-丁烷活化的关键步骤，这是通过同位素效应动力学研究证明的。

热力学考虑表明，活性氧物种的参与在轻烷烃的激活中起着重要作用。表明可以激活的位点存在，而无需外部氧气，这显著促进了氧化的产物。存在具有特定空位或过剩氧离子的钒位，它们对催化活性有贡献，但它们对反应机制的具体影响往往不明确。

掺杂剂如钴可以通过改变V4+/V5+比率和表面原子分布来增强催化剂活性，暗示隔离位点和表面属性修改的重要性。超氧物种和过氧物种的存在表明了激活途径的多样性，突显了催化机制的潜在多样性和复杂性。

特别是在活性物种的稳定化方面，通过隔离位点，正如Gleaves和Panov所提出的那样，强调了结构缺陷在催化中的重要性。

简而言之，ODH的效率依赖于开发能够克服激活障碍、生成和稳定活性中间体，并保持高选择性的催化剂。理解各种催化剂组件的特定作用以及活性氧物种稳定机制对于推进该领域至关重要。
