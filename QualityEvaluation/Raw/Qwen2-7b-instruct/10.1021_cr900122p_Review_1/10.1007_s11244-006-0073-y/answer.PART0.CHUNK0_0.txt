[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
[3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reactions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb-ing."
[4] "All these steps may involve different oxygen species spatially or temporally distributed on the surface."
[5] "Fur- thermore the lifetime of the intermediates adsorbed species formed during the oxidation reaction has been shown to be relatively long and movement of organic species, surface modification and influence of co-adsorbed intermediate species have to be considered."
[6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
[7] "Very early it has been proposed that the alkane activation sites were related to structure defects."
[8] "Oxides for catalytic oxidation are intrinsic semicon- ductor oxides either of type p or n."
[9] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
[10] "It has also been proposed that weakly adsorbed surface oxygen species could activate the first CH bond."
[11] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor."
[12] "The behavior of the solid, which is that of a p-type semi-conductor, is reversible and typical of a redox mechanism since the same n-butane/O2 sequences provide identical variations of r."
[13] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations."
[14] "Based on calculation and modeling of vanadium oxide clusters, Witko et al. have suggested that a general feature of CH activation at the surface of a transition metal oxide with semi-conducting properties is that both parts of the cleaved CH bond become attached to the surface oxide ions."
[15] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in ODH often stem from the complexity of the reaction pathways, which involve multiple steps occurring simultaneously on the adsorbed phase. This complexity is further exacerbated by the spatial and temporal distribution of different oxygen species on the surface, the long lifetimes of intermediates, and the influence of co-adsorbed species.

In addressing these challenges, catalysts like VPO and VSbO provide distinct mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that effectively overcome the activation step. Site isolation, particularly at the surface of transition metal oxides with semi-conducting properties, is essential for stabilizing active species that mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation. This isolation ensures that the active sites are optimized for efficient activation, thereby enhancing process efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanisms highlight the importance of C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction in ODH. The role of oxygen species, whether lattice-bound or adsorbed, is pivotal in these mechanisms. Understanding how these factors collectively influence the process efficiency is critical for advancing ODH technology and developing more effective catalysts.

The involvement of O) species in alkane activation has been proposed based on thermodynamic considerations. The stabilization of these active species is facilitated by structural defects in the catalyst, such as excess oxygen anions or cationic vacancies. This stabilization is further enhanced by the redox properties of the catalysts, which enable reversible changes in conductivity and charge carrier concentration.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues in ODH. By confining the active sites, the process can be optimized to selectively favor certain pathways over others, leading to improved product distribution and yield. The use of theoretical studies and modeling to understand the properties of these defective sites can further refine catalyst design and improve reaction outcomes.

In summary, the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and proposed reaction mechanisms collectively influence the efficiency of ODH. Site isolation, facilitated by structural defects and redox properties, is a key factor in addressing selectivity issues and optimizing the process for enhanced performance.

在分析轻烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）时，各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，在实现高选择性和转化方面发挥着关键作用。ODH面临的挑战通常源于反应路径的复杂性，这些路径涉及同时在吸附相上发生多个步骤，这进一步增加了空间和时间上分布于表面的不同氧物种的复杂性。长中间体的寿命、有机物种的移动、表面修改以及共吸附中间物种的影响也必须考虑在内。

在克服这些挑战中，如VPO和VSbO这样的催化剂提供了特定的烃激活机制，明显地跨越了激活步骤。表面氧化离子的隔离，特别是在具有半导体性质的过渡金属氧化物表面上，对于优化烷烃激活过程至关重要，从而提高过程效率。

根据热力学考虑提出的O)物种在烷烃激活中的参与。通过结构缺陷，如过剩的氧阴离子或正电荷空位的稳定化，这些活性物种得以在ODH中得到优化。这种稳定化通过催化剂的还原性质得以增强，这些性质能够使电导率和电荷载体浓度的可逆变化。

表面隔离在解决ODH的选择性问题中起着重要作用。通过限制活性位点，可以优化特定途径的选择，从而提高产物分布和产率。理论研究和建模的使用可以进一步细化催化剂设计并改善反应结果，以进一步提高性能。

综上所述，各种催化剂、选择性和转化的挑战、以及所提出的反应机制共同影响ODH的效率。通过结构缺陷和还原性质促进的表面隔离是解决选择性问题和优化过程的关键因素。
