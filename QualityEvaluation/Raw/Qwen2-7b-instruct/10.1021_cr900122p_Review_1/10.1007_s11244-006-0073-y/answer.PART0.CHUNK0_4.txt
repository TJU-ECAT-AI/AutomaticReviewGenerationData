Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it becomes evident that achieving high selectivity and conversion is a multifaceted challenge. The effectiveness of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role. Catalysts like VPO, Ti(Zr)PO, VSbO, and MoVTeNbO are highlighted as efficient in the activation of alkanes. These catalysts employ mechanisms involving sites with specific properties such as strong Bronsted acidity, Lewis acidity, and electrophilic species, often associated with structure defects. The presence of active sites related to structure defects, such as cationic vacancies or excess oxygen, is pivotal for the activation process.

The complexity of selective alkane oxidation lies in the multitude of reaction pathways, each with several steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorption. This necessitates the development of robust catalysts capable of overcoming the activation step effectively. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO, offer distinct mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that surpass the initial activation barrier. The first step of transforming alkane molecules typically involves oxidative dehydrogenation.

Multiple proposed pathways exist for alkane activation, but no single mechanism consistently emerges as superior. This multiplicity of pathways underscores the challenge in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Site isolation is recognized as a critical factor in stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species, contributing to the stabilization of reactive intermediates. 

The role of oxygen species, particularly O) species, in the activation process is emphasized. These species, often associated with structure defects, facilitate the activation of alkane molecules through processes like C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. However, their involvement is specifically highlighted in the alkane activation process, rather than in subsequent steps leading to the formation of oxygenated molecules. This distinction underscores the importance of site-specific interactions in controlling the efficiency and selectivity of the overall ODH process.

分析轻烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），可以发现，实现高选择性和转化率是一个多方面挑战。各种催化剂，包括体金属氧化物和支持系统，在此过程中起着关键作用。如VPO、Ti(Zr)PO、VSbO和MoVTeNbO等高效催化剂被强调为轻烷烃选择性氧化的关键。这些催化剂采用涉及具有特定性质的站点机制，例如强布隆斯酸性、Lewis酸性和亲电物种，通常与结构缺陷相关联。结构缺陷的存在，如阳离子空位或过剩氧，对激活过程至关重要。

选择性烷烃氧化的复杂性在于存在多种反应路径，每个路径包含几个在吸附相上发生的步骤而没有脱附。这要求开发能够有效克服活化步骤的高效催化剂。高效催化剂，如VPO或VSbO，提供了独特的碳氢化合物活化机制，显著超越了初始活化步骤。烷烃分子转换的第一步通常涉及氧化脱氢。

已提出多种烷烃活化途径，但没有单一机制脱颖而出。这种途径的多样性突出了在实现高选择性和转化率时面临的挑战。站点隔离被认识到是稳定活性物种中间体（介于晶格氧和吸附氧物种之间）的关键因素，有助于稳定反应中间体。

氧气物种的作用，特别是O)物种，在活化过程中得到强调。这些物种，常与结构缺陷相关联，通过过程如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽取来促进烷烃分子的活化。然而，它们的作用仅限于活化过程，而非随后导致形成氧官能团分子的步骤。这一区别突显了特定站点相互作用在控制整个ODH过程效率和选择性方面的关键性。
