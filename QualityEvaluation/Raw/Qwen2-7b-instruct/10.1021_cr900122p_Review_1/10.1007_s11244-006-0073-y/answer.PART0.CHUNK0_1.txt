[1] "Mechanism of first hydrogen abstraction from light alkanes on oxide catalysts."
[2] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
[3] "Although these catalysts have been the centre of numerous scientific publications, a clear understanding of the first step of the reaction, the activation of the first CH bond of the alkane molecule, is lacking."
[4] "Very early it has been proposed that the alkane activation sites were related to structure defects."
[5] "It has been widely demonstrated that mechanisms involved in alkene oxidation are based on the well-known Mars and van Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
[7] "If most of the studies agree on the proposed reaction processes following this first step, they are less clear on the way by which the alkane molecules are activated."
[8] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reactions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb-ing."
[9] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
[10] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semiconductor."
[11] "The behavior of the solid, which is that of a p-type semiconductor, is reversible and typical of a redox mechanism since the same n-butane/O2 sequences provide identical variations of r."
[12] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bronsted sites titration with K+ experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane."
[13] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
[14] "Among the dopants, one of the most interesting and efficient one is cobalt."
[15] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms."
[16] "The increase of activity should decrease the surface oxygen content destabilizing the proposed catalytic sites with excess of oxygen anions or cationic vacancies."
[17] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
[18] "On ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
[19] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
[20] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
[21] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independent of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
[22] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabilization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
[23] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements."
[24] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
[25] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ionized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction."
[26] "When Ti and Fe were studied as substituants, it was observed that they exhibited opposite effects."
[27] "The study of the iron substitution at low loading has shown that Fe3+ was substituting V4+ with the formation of an anionic vacancy for charge balance instead of V3+. Fe3+ should participate to the vanadium isolation but should not substitute vanadium neighboring a cat-ionic vacancy that would have led to an unstable structure."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, the literature discusses the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO and VSbO, provide specific activation mechanisms that overcome the initial activation step. Structure defects, like oxygen anions and cationic vacancies, are proposed as active sites for alkane activation. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism explains alkene oxidation, while C-H bond activation and M-alkyl intermediates are discussed for alkane oxidation. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Cobalt doping enhances catalyst activity by modifying the V5+/V4+ ratio, potentially stabilizing active sites. The behavior of catalysts like ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 varies under different temperatures, affecting their catalytic properties. The probability of hydrogen abstraction depends on the type of mechanism and the presence of adsorbed intermediates. Electrical conductivity measurements provide insights into the presence of oxidizing species and the nature of the catalytic phase. Doping with metals like cobalt and iron influences the catalyst's performance and structure. Overall, the factors collectively influence process efficiency, with site isolation addressing selectivity issues.
