The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the complex mechanisms of C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The efficiency of the process is influenced by these factors, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Understanding the precise reaction mechanisms and optimizing the catalyst properties can lead to more efficient ODH processes.
