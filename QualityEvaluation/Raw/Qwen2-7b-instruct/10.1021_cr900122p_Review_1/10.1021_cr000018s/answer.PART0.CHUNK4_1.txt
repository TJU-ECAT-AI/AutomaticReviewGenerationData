The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves several challenges, primarily related to selectively activating the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds within alkanes. Catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems are key components that impact both the efficiency and selectivity of alkane conversion. Proposed reaction mechanisms typically feature the activation of C-H bonds, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent hydrogen abstraction steps. Site isolation strategies are used to enhance selectivity by confining the reaction pathways, leading to improved product purity. The combined effect of catalyst characteristics, operational conditions, and reaction mechanisms plays a critical role in determining the overall effectiveness of the ODH process.
