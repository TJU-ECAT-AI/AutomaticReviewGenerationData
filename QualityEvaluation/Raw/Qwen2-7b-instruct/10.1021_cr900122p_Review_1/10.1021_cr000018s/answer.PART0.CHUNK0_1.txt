[1] "A significant reduction of these CO2 emissions could be achieved by developing selective oxidation processes for converting methane and C2C4 alkanes to olefins and oxygenates directly."
[2] "As a consequence, one can envision the replacement of highly endothermic processes needed to generate unsaturated precursors with exothermic, single-step alkane-oxidation processes that, if properly operated, would generate energy as well as chemical products."
[3] "The development of more selective catalysts for the oxidation of olefins and aromatics should also be pursued, since success will contribute to additional reductions in CO2 emissions."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) aims to convert alkanes into olefins directly, thereby replacing endothermic processes with exothermic ones that can generate energy along with chemical products. Achieving high selectivity in this process is crucial for reducing CO2 emissions. Additionally, improving catalysts for the oxidation of olefins and aromatics will also lead to further CO2 emission reductions.
