Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we find that the process relies on diverse catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving both high selectivity and conversion in ODH is fraught with difficulties. The underlying mechanisms often encompass C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These elements collectively impact the efficiency of the process. Additionally, site isolation emerges as a critical strategy to tackle selectivity challenges.
