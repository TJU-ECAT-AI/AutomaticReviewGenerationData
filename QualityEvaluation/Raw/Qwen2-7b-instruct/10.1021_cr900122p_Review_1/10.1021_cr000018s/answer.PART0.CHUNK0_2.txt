The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, particularly methane and other C2-C4 alkanes, is a promising method for producing olefins and oxygenates directly, aiming to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and offer economic advantages. The challenge lies in achieving a high yield of olefins without combustion of the feedstock or intermediate products. Catalysts, especially those based on metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in this process. Researchers have observed that as alkane conversion increases, olefin selectivity declines, but this decline can be mitigated by increasing the basicity of the support material. Recent studies have focused on understanding the relationships between catalyst structure, such as the size and composition of vanadia domains, and the resulting performance in terms of selectivity and activity. The selectivity towards olefin formation is influenced by the size of the active domains, with propene combustion occurring on larger domains and propane combustion on smaller ones.

氧化脱氢化（ODH）是将烷烃，尤其是甲烷和其他C2-C4烷烃直接转化为烯烃和氧基化合物的一种有前景的方法，旨在大幅减少二氧化碳排放并实现经济效益。挑战在于在不燃烧原料或中间产物的情况下获得高产率的烯烃。金属氧化物及其支持系统作为催化剂，在这一过程中发挥关键作用。研究者发现，随着烷烃转化率的增加，烯烃选择性会下降，但通过增加支撑材料的基本性可以缓解这一下降趋势。最近的研究集中在理解催化剂结构与性能之间的关系上，例如钒酸盐域的大小和组成如何影响活性和选择性。选择性向烯烃形成受到活性域尺寸的影响，丙烯燃烧发生在较大域上，而丙烷燃烧发生在较小域上。
