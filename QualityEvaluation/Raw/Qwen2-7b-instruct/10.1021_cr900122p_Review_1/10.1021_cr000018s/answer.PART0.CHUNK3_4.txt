The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. High selectivity and conversion in ODH processes are challenging due to the need for precise control over the active sites on the catalyst surface, reaction conditions, and the properties of reactants and products. Site isolation techniques are employed to prevent unwanted side reactions and enhance the reactivity of the active sites. The proposed reaction mechanisms typically include C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps, which are crucial for understanding the detailed pathways of the ODH reaction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues.
