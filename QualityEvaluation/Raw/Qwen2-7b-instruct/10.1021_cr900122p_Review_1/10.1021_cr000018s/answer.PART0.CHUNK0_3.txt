[1] "The key points with respect to research needs, challenges, and opportunities emphasized in this section are as follows: (1) more catalyst evaluation and in situ characterization studies at >10 atm under in-situ conditions; (2) need for accelerated aging studies to quickly assess catalyst performance under real operating conditions; (3) better mechanistic understanding of factors which cause catalyst sintering; (4) more efficient means of energy input into SMR operations; (5) overcome heat transfer limitations in SMR operations; (6) improved control of metal dust formation and corrosion; (7) pursuit of nonfossil fuel-based H2 production technologies; (8) use of CH4 as a substitute for H2 in chemicals production; (9) development of safe operating processes for direct CH4 oxidation to CO/H2; (10) development of efficient photocatalytic processes for H2O splitting that operate at or near ambient temperature and pressure with high activity and selectivity; (11) utilization of the entire solar spectrum for photocatalytic/photoelectrolytic processes for H2O splitting; and (12) better mechanistic understanding and implementation of what is learned from biomimetic H2 formation processes."
[2] "The most attractive feature of these electrophilic systems is their selectivity: the reactivity of the methyl group is substantially greater than that of an already functionalized position such as HCH2OH or HCH2SO4H (by as much as 100 times)."
[3] "The mechanism of the Shilov system, 103 representing one class of such electrophilic hydroxylation systems, has now been studied extensively, and many of the mechanistic features have been established. 104"
[4] "Significantly, step i is most likely endothermic, and the success of the alkane functionalization with these highly electrophilic metal complexes results from oxidation of the intermediate Pt(II)alkyl, competitive with reprotonation to alkane via the reverse sequence."
[5] "One of the first systems developed utilizes Hg2+ in sulfuric acid. 101,106 Maximum one-pass yields of approximately 40% at 90% selectivity are obtained (eq 18, Figure 8)."
[6] "The key features of the reaction mechanism appear to involve three stages: (i) dissociative substitution of methane for a ligand (likely hydrogensulfate) at Hg2+ to generate a methane σ complex, which subsequently undergoes deprotonation to a methylmercury intermediate, (ii) functionalization by SN2 displacement of methyl hydrogensulfate with reduction of mercury and net formation of mercurous hydrogensulfate, and (iii) oxidation of mercurous to mercuric by sulfuric acid with release of SO2 and water."
[7] "Although the yields of this catalytic system are among the highest ever reported for the direct oxidation of methane to an oxygenate, there are several disadvantages that have prevented commercialization of the process."
[8] "Recent progress includes the discovery of novel iron-based catalysts that can activate dioxygen and alkane CH bonds simultaneously, resulting in the direct oxidations of alkanes."
[9] "The mechanism of these reactions has not yet been established, their general features, especially the chemoselectivities (higher reactivity of alkanes compared to alcohols; preference for methyl groups in functional organics), suggest that alkane activation likely occurs by an electrophilic pathway as discussed above."
[10] "For the Rh-based system, even methyl iodide is found to be less reactive than methane."
[11] "The reason for not observing TBHP in crude reaction products and for accelerated reaction rates using these electron-deficient metalloporphyrin complexes is their extremely high activity for decomposing hydroperoxides, acting as living initiators that continuously provide high radical flux at low reaction temperatures."
