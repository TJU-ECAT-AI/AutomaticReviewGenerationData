Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the intricacies of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by dictating the pathway of the reaction, the stability of intermediates, and the ease of product formation. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing unwanted side reactions and directing the reaction towards the desired product.

In particular, the formation of CC bonds between olefins + CO2 and alkynes + CO2 requires initial coordination of the olefin or alkyne to the metal center followed by the attack of CO2 at an activated carbon atom. The formation of MC(O)OM linkages or the one-electron reduction of MCOOH can facilitate the cleavage of CO bonds. During the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, a vacant coordination site on the catalyst surface aids in the cleavage of the CO bond. Moreover, CO2 binding often occurs through bonds to both the carbon and oxygen atoms of the molecule, influencing the reaction pathway and product selectivity.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，该过程涉及各种催化剂的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支持体系。实现高选择性和转化的挑战源自反应机制的复杂性，包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H的抽象。这些因素共同影响过程效率，通过决定反应路径、中间体稳定性以及目标产物形成的可能性。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过防止不希望的副反应并引导反应朝向预期产物方向发展。

特别是，烯烃+CO2和炔烃+CO2之间形成CC键需要初始将烯烃或炔烃与金属中心配位，随后由激活碳原子攻击CO2。MC(O)OM键的形成或MCOOH的一电子还原可以促进CO键断裂。在通过Pd催化剂介导的CO2电化学还原到CO过程中，催化剂表面的空配位位点有助于CO键的断裂。此外，CO2结合通常通过分子的碳和氧原子上的键进行，影响反应路径和产物选择性。
