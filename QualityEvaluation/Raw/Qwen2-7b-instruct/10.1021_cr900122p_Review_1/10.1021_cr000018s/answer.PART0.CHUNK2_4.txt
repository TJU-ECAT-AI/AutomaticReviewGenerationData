Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves understanding the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. High selectivity and conversion rates are crucial for the efficiency of the ODH process, but achieving these goals is challenging. Site isolation strategies are particularly effective in enhancing selectivity. In the ODH process, the initial step involves activating C-H bonds, leading to the formation of M-alkyl intermediates. Subsequent reactions typically involve the abstraction of 2H atoms, resulting in the formation of olefins. To address selectivity issues, researchers employ site isolation techniques to confine active sites on the catalyst surface. Understanding the detailed reaction mechanisms, including metal-support interactions and the stability of transition states, is essential for optimizing the ODH process. By tailoring catalyst properties, scientists aim to improve both the activity and selectivity of ODH catalysts.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及理解各种催化剂的作用，包括单体金属氧化物和支撑系统。高选择性和转化率对于ODH过程的效率至关重要，但实现这些目标存在挑战。隔离位点策略特别有效于提高选择性。在ODH过程中，第一步通常涉及激活C-H键，导致形成M-烷基中间体。后续反应通常涉及去除2H原子，导致形成烯烃。为了解决选择性问题，研究人员采用位点隔离技术来限制催化剂表面上的活性位点。理解详细的反应机制，包括金属-支撑相互作用和过渡态的稳定性，对于优化ODH过程是至关重要的。通过调整催化剂性质，科学家们旨在提高ODH催化剂的活性和选择性。
