The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to activate C-H bonds and form M-alkyl intermediates. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is challenging due to complex reaction pathways and the potential for side reactions. Site isolation methods can improve selectivity by confining the reaction environment around specific active sites. Various factors, including catalyst choice, support material, and reaction conditions, collectively impact the efficiency of ODH processes.
