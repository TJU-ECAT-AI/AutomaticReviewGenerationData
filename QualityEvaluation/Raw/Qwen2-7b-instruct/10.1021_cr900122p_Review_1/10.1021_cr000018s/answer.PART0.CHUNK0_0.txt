[1] "The key points with respect to research needs, challenges, and opportunities emphasized in this section are as follows: (1) more catalyst evaluation and in situ characterization studies at >10 atm under in-situ conditions; (2) need for accelerated aging studies to quickly assess catalyst performance under real operating conditions; (3) better mechanistic understanding of factors which cause catalyst sintering; (4) more efficient means of energy input into SMR operations; (5) overcome heat transfer limitations in SMR operations; (6) improved control of metal dust formation and corrosion; (7) pursuit of nonfossil fuel-based H2 production technologies; (8) use of CH4 as a substitute for H2 in chemicals production; (9) development of safe operating processes for direct CH4 oxidation to CO/H2; (10) development of efficient photocatalytic processes for H2O splitting that operate at or near ambient temperature and pressure with high activity and selectivity; (11) utilization of the entire solar spectrum for photocatalytic/photoelectrolytic processes for H2O splitting; and (12) better mechanistic understanding and implementation of what is learned from biomimetic H2 formation processes."
