Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding how various catalysts, both bulk metal oxides and supported systems, interact. High selectivity and conversion rates are challenging to achieve due to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is a critical factor in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the reaction environment. Optimizing the process efficiency requires a deep understanding of how these elements collectively influence the ODH reactions.
