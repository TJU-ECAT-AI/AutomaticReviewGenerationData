B. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes, where the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2.

C. As seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox.

D. The effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts. 84 The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio.

E. There have been many reports of alkane oxidation by combinations of iron complexes and peroxide oxidants.113c Often such combinations give rise to HaberWeiss chemistry and the aliphatic CH bond is cleaved by an alkoxy or hydroxy radical. Subsequent trapping of the incipient alkyl radical by O2 leads to approximately equimolar amounts of alcohol and ketone products.

F. A number of significant challenges must be overcome in order to develop catalysts for the selective, energy-efficient oxidation of alkanes to valuable chemical products without large quantities of unwanted byproducts such as CO2. These include the following: (1) identification of the reaction pathways leading to primary and secondary products and determination of the rate coefficients for each path; (2) in situ identification of reactive intermediates; (3) determination of the reactivity of different forms of oxygen present at the catalyst surface and their role in catalyzing desired and undesired oxidation processes; (4) identification of the elementary processes involved in hydrogen abstraction, carboncarbon bond cleavage, and oxygen insertion and the role of redox properties of metal cations in these processes; (5) establishment of the relative reactivities of carbonhydrogen bonds (1, 2, 3, HCH2X (X = OH, halide, etc.) toward soluble transition-metal complexes capable of electrophilic CH bond activation; (6) identification of the mechanisms and requirements for oxidation of Pt(II) alkyls; (7) developing approaches for rapid screening of potential electrophilic transition-metal complexes for selective, catalytic hydrocarbon oxidations under dioxygen; and (8) for new biomimetic catalysts, the development of robust ligands that can withstand oxidizing conditions of the reaction, the design of reaction conditions that maintain low oxidant concentrations to minimize undesirable side reactions such as hydroxy radical formation, and the development of catalysts that utilize O2 as oxidant.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, it's crucial to balance the yield of alkenes without combusting the alkane to CO2. Mitsubishi reported a catalyst system that achieves a high yield of acrylic acid from propane oxidation, surpassing 52%. Phosphorus/vanadium ratios significantly influence the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation in butane oxidation, with higher ratios leading to increased selectivity. Alkane oxidation reactions often involve Haber-Weiss chemistry, resulting in the cleavage of the aliphatic CH bond by alkoxy or hydroxy radicals. Screening potential catalysts for selective alkane oxidation under dioxygen requires overcoming numerous challenges, including identifying reaction pathways, characterizing reactive intermediates, determining oxygen reactivity, understanding hydrogen abstraction and carbon-carbon bond cleavage, assessing redox properties, and developing robust ligands for biomimetic catalysts.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），关键在于平衡丙烯等烯烃的产率，同时避免烷烃或丙烯燃烧生成CO2。三菱报告了一种催化剂系统，通过丙烷氧化可以得到超过52%的高收率的丙烯酸。磷/钒比在丁烷氧化中显著影响马来酸酐的产率选择性，较高的比例导致选择性的增加。烷烃氧化反应往往涉及哈伯-怀斯化学，导致由醇氧或羟基自由基切割直链碳氢键。筛选在氧气下进行选择性烷烃氧化的潜在催化剂需要克服众多挑战，包括确定反应途径、识别活性中间体、确定表面氧的活性以及它们在催化所需和不需要的氧化过程中的作用、理解氢提取和碳碳键断裂的机制、评估红氧化性质，以及开发生物模拟催化剂所需的坚固配体。
