Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process involves utilizing catalysts like bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion faces challenges due to intricate reaction pathways and the risk of side reactions. Catalyst design focuses on balancing activation energy and reaction kinetics. Site isolation techniques are employed to improve selectivity by segregating reactants and products. Mechanistic studies suggest that C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediate formation, and 2H-abstraction are pivotal steps. Site isolation mitigates selectivity issues by confining processes to specific areas of the catalyst surface. Efficiency enhancements typically entail refining catalyst composition, improving support characteristics, and optimizing operational parameters.
