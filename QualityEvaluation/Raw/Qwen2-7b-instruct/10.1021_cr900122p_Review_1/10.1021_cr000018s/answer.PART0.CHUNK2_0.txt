Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process relies on diverse catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. High selectivity and conversion rates are difficult to achieve due to the potential formation of undesired byproducts. The mechanism typically involves the activation of C-H bonds, the creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation is essential for mitigating selectivity challenges in the ODH process.
