[1] "Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined."
[2] "In many instances, CO2 binding occurs via bonds to both the CO2 carbon and oxygen atoms. The role of such cooperative interactions is not well understood, and systematic studies should be informative."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are primarily attributed to the intricate mechanisms involved, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by these factors, with the selectivity often being a major hurdle. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific regions of the catalyst, thereby enhancing control over the reaction pathway and product distribution.

The role of catalysts in ODH is multifaceted, encompassing both the bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The selectivity and conversion rates are influenced by the catalyst's ability to activate the C-H bonds effectively, facilitate the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and manage the abstraction of hydrogen atoms to prevent unwanted side reactions. Achieving high selectivity often requires a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the precise tuning of the catalyst properties, such as surface area, porosity, and composition.

Systematic studies focusing on the cooperative interactions between the catalyst and reactants are essential for advancing the field. Understanding how CO2 binds to both the carbon and oxygen atoms of the catalyst and the implications of such cooperative interactions can provide insights into improving selectivity and conversion. By conducting detailed investigations, researchers can gain a clearer picture of the reaction pathways and identify strategies to optimize catalyst performance for ODH reactions.
