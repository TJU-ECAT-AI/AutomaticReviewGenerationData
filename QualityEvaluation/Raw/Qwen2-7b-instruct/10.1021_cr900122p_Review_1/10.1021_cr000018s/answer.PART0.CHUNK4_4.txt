Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we find that achieving high selectivity and conversion involves several key factors. These include the selection of efficient catalysts capable of selectively activating C-H bonds and forming M-alkyl intermediates without generating undesired products. Site isolation techniques are employed to confine the reaction to specific catalytic sites, thus reducing the probability of competing pathways. The reaction mechanism generally involves the activation of the C-H bond by the catalyst, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Subsequently, a hydrogen atom (2H-abstraction) is removed, resulting in the dehydrogenation of the alkane.

Various catalyst types, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are utilized for ODH, each with its own set of advantages and limitations. While bulk catalysts offer better stability, they may lack the controlled site isolation necessary for high selectivity. Supported catalysts, however, enable more precise control over active sites, potentially leading to higher selectivity and conversion rates. However, they may encounter issues like sintering and the risk of active species leaching.

Efficiency improvements in ODH processes are achieved through the design of novel catalyst architectures, optimization of reaction parameters, and the integration of multiple catalytic steps to enhance both selectivity and conversion rates.
