[1] "Developing efficient strategies for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes to value-added chemicals or liquid fuels would provide a promising alternative for easing up the oil-demanding situation."
[2] "The common feature of these reactions is that all of them use the high-valence transition metal oxides, such as vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, as catalysts."
[3] "In most cases, the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxides occurs through the so-called Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, 4-5 in which the organic molecule reacts with the lattice oxygen, and then the oxygen vacancy is replenished by gaseous oxygen."
[4] "The roles that a good catalyst play involve (i) the effective activation of the first CH bond, (ii) the directional transformation of the resulting intermediates into the partial oxidation product, and (iii) a fast reoxidation of the reduced surface."
[5] "From the thermodynamic point of view, the strength of the resulting OH bond is a suitable parameter."
[6] "In particular, we emphasize the role that the OH bond strength plays in determining the reactivity of a metal oxide."
[7] "It is generally accepted that the strength of the OH bond is a key parameter11,12,19 that controls the activation of the CH bond over the metal oxide catalysts."
[8] "Our calculations show that the reducibility decreases from Cr to V, to Mo, and to W, in parallel with the sequence of decreasing strength of the OH bonds (see Table 1)."
[9] "Protons can be stabilized on both the terminal oxygen and the bridge oxygen sites, as shown by the large proton affinities (PAs) in Table 1."
[10] "The plots of BE(OH), electron affinities, ΔEST, and BE(MO) vs the HOMO/LUMO energy gap are depicted in Figure 4."
[11] "For a given RH, the reactivity decreases in the order of Cr, V, Mo, and W, as the calculated barriers increase in this series."
[12] "We find that the H abstraction barriers are closely related to the energy gaps of oxides, as shown in Figure 6."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature discusses the importance of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in the process often stem from difficulties in balancing the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts, especially concerning the activation of C-H bonds and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates. The 2H-abstraction mechanism plays a crucial role in the ODH process, influencing the efficiency of the reactions.

Site isolation techniques are employed to address selectivity issues by controlling the reaction environment and the interactions between the catalysts and the alkane molecules. By isolating active sites, the catalyst can more effectively activate the desired C-H bond without unintended side reactions, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates.

The interplay between the catalyst's structure, reactivity, and selectivity is critical in optimizing the ODH process. Factors such as the strength of the OH bond, electron affinity, and the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO of the metal oxides all influence the efficiency of the reactions. The literature supports the notion that these parameters are interrelated and can be used to predict and enhance the catalytic performance of metal oxides in ODH reactions.

在分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程中，文献探讨了各种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统）在实现高选择性和转化率方面的重要性。过程中的挑战通常源自催化剂活性和选择性之间的平衡困难，特别是对于C-H键的活化和M-烷基中间体的形成。2H-抽象机制在ODH过程中起着关键作用，影响反应的效率。

通过采用位点隔离技术，可以控制反应环境和催化剂与烷烃分子之间的相互作用，以解决选择性问题。通过隔离活性位点，催化剂可以更有效地激活所需C-H键，而不会发生意外的副反应，从而提高选择性和转化率。

催化剂结构、活性和选择性之间的互动对于优化ODH过程至关重要。诸如OH键强度、电子亲和力以及金属氧化物中HOMO和LUMO能隙等因素都影响反应效率。文献支持这些参数之间存在关联，并可用于预测和增强金属氧化物在ODH反应中的催化性能。
