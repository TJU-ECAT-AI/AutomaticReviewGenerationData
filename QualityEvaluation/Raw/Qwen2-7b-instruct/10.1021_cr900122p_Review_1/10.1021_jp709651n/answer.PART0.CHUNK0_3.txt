[1] "The common feature of these reactions is that all of them use the high-valence transition metal oxides, such as vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, as catalysts."
[2] "In most cases, the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxides occurs through the so-called Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, 4-5 in which the organic molecule reacts with the lattice oxygen, and then the oxygen vacancy is replenished by gaseous oxygen."
[3] "The roles that a good catalyst play involve (i) the effective activation of the first CH bond, (ii) the directional transformation of the resulting intermediates into the partial oxidation product, and (iii) a fast reoxidation of the reduced surface."
[4] "It is widely accepted that the strength of the OH bond is a key parameter11,12,19 that controls the activation of the CH bond over the metal oxide catalysts: The stronger the OH bond forms, the more rapid the reaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the oxide surface."
[5] "The strength of the OH bond decreases down the column from Cr to Mo, and to W, while that of V is in between Cr and Mo."
[6] "Our calculations show that the reducibility decreases from Cr to V, to Mo, and to W, in parallel with the sequence of decreasing strength of the OH bonds (see Table 1)."
[7] "The plots of BE(OH), electron affinities, ΔEST, and BE(MO) vs the HOMO/LUMO energy gap are depicted in Figure 4. We can see that ΔEST increases in parallel with the energy gap, while EA decreases monotonically as the energy gap increases, in consistency with the frontier orbital analysis."
[8] "For a given RH, the reactivity decreases in the order of Cr, V, Mo, and W, as the calculated barriers increase in this series. This correlates well with the trend of the OH bond strengths."
[9] "We find that the H abstraction barriers are closely related to the energy gaps of oxides, as shown in Figure 6. For a given RH, the calculated barriers increase from Cr to V, to Mo, and to W, in good agreement with the increased tendency of the energy gap."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves several key factors influencing its efficiency. Catalysts such as high-valence transition metal oxides, including vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, play a crucial role in ODH. These catalysts activate the first C-H bond through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, where the organic molecule reacts with lattice oxygen, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy with gaseous oxygen. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their ability to activate the C-H bond efficiently, convert intermediates into desired products, and rapidly re-oxidize the reduced surface.

The strength of the OH bond is a critical factor in determining the reactivity of metal oxide catalysts. As the OH bond strength decreases down the column from chromium to tungsten, the reactivity of the metal oxide catalysts also diminishes. This correlation is further supported by the analysis of electron affinities (EA), ΔEST (singlet-triplet excitation energy), and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO. These properties collectively influence the catalytic efficiency by affecting the activation energy of the C-H bond and the ability of the metal oxide to abstract hydrogen atoms from alkanes.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues in ODH. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO of the metal oxides determines the strength of the OH bond, which is inversely proportional to the energy gap. This relationship helps in understanding how the energy gap affects the reactivity of different catalysts towards alkanes. By correlating the energy gap with the calculated H abstraction barriers and the reaction enthalpy, researchers can predict the reactivity of metal oxides towards alkanes, thereby optimizing the catalyst selection for achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH.

In summary, the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms collectively influence the process efficiency of ODH. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues highlights the importance of understanding the underlying physical and chemical properties of metal oxides for developing efficient catalysts in ODH.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，涉及多个关键因素影响其效率。包括钒、铬、钼和钨等高价过渡金属氧化物在内的催化剂在ODH中起着至关重要的作用。这些催化剂通过Marsvan Krevelen机制激活第一个C-H键，其中有机分子与晶格氧反应，随后由气体氧补充氧空位。这些催化剂的有效性取决于它们激活C-H键的能力、将中间体转化为所需产物的能力以及快速还原表面的能力。

OH键的强度是决定金属氧化物催化剂活性的关键因素。随着OH键强度从铬到钨逐渐降低，金属氧化物催化剂的活性也相应减小。这一相关性进一步通过电子亲和能（EA）、ΔEST（单态-三重态激发能）和HOMO与LUMO能量差的分析得到证实。这些性质共同影响催化效率，通过影响C-H键的活化能和金属氧化物从烷烃中抽象氢原子的能力。

位点隔离在解决ODH选择性问题方面发挥着重要作用。金属氧化物的能量差决定了OH键的强度，该强度与其能量差成反比。这种关系有助于理解不同催化剂对烷烃的作用力如何受到能量差的影响。通过将能量差与计算的H抽象障碍和反应热力学联系起来，研究人员可以预测金属氧化物对烷烃的活性，从而优化催化剂的选择，以实现ODH的高选择性和转化率。

总之，各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制以及位点隔离在ODH过程中共同影响过程效率。理解金属氧化物的基本物理和化学性质对于开发高效催化剂至关重要，以促进ODH。
