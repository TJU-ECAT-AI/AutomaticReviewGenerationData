[1] "Developing efficient strategies for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes to value-added chemicals or liquid fuels would provide a promising alternative for easing up the oil-demanding situation."
[2] "The roles that a good catalyst play involve (i) the effective activation of the first CH bond, (ii) the directional transformation of the resulting intermediates into the partial oxidation product, and (iii) a fast reoxidation of the reduced surface."
[3] "The general trends for the H abstraction pathways can be summarized as the following: (1) For a given RH, the reactivity decreases in the order of Cr, V, Mo, and W, as the calculated barriers increase in this series. This correlates well with the trend of the OH bond strengths."
[4] "For a given RH, the calculated barriers increase from Cr to V, to Mo, and to W, in good agreement with the increased tendency of the energy gap."
[5] "We find that the H abstraction barriers are closely related to the energy gaps of oxides, as shown in Figure 6."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a crucial process for converting lower alkanes into value-added chemicals or liquid fuels. Efficient catalysts play a pivotal role in this process, particularly high-valence d0 transition metal oxides. These catalysts activate the first C-H bond, direct the intermediates towards the desired oxidation product, and rapidly reoxidize the surface. The reactivity of these catalysts is closely tied to the strength of the OH bond, which influences the ability to abstract hydrogen atoms from the alkane molecules. The energy gap of the oxides, which correlates with the OH bond strength, also affects the reactivity of the catalysts. As the energy gap increases, the reactivity of the catalysts tends to decrease, reflecting the complexity in achieving high selectivity and conversion in the ODH process. Site isolation strategies are employed to address selectivity issues by controlling the reaction pathways and enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个关键的过程，用于将低级烷烃转化为附加值化学品或液体燃料。高效的催化剂在这一过程中扮演着至关重要的角色，尤其是高价d0过渡金属氧化物。这些催化剂有效地激活第一个C-H键，将中间体定向为所需的氧化产物，并快速地对表面进行再氧化。这些催化剂的活性与OH键的强度密切相关，这影响了从烷烃分子中提取氢原子的能力。氧化物的能量间隙也影响催化剂的活性，与OH键强度相关。随着能量间隙的增加，催化剂的活性往往会降低，反映了在ODH过程中实现高选择性和转化率的复杂性。通过隔离位点策略来解决选择性问题，通过控制反应途径和提高催化过程的效率。
