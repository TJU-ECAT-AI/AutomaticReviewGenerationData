The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces significant challenges due to the inherent difficulty in achieving both high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, have been studied for their potential to enhance the efficiency of these reactions. Catalyst performance is influenced by several factors, such as the characteristics of the support material, the size of the metal particles, and the use of promoters. Reaction mechanisms typically involve C-H bond activation, the creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is critical in addressing selectivity issues, as it helps to manage the reaction pathways and product distribution. Optimizing catalyst composition, support type, and reaction conditions can lead to high selectivity and conversion in ODH processes.
