The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a well-studied process, with significant attention given to the role of catalysts. Researchers have investigated various catalyst types, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to enhance the efficiency of ODH. Despite advancements, achieving high selectivity and conversion rates remains a challenge. The mechanism of ODH involves the activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is recognized as a crucial factor in improving selectivity.
