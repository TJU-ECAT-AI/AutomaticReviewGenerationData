The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a pivotal process in the chemical industry for producing olefins. Various catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, have been studied for their efficacy in ODH. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the intricate reaction mechanisms involved. Catalyst design, particularly focusing on the optimization of active sites and support materials, plays a significant role in addressing these challenges. Proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, the creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation within the catalyst structure influences selectivity by managing the reactivity of different regions. Understanding and controlling these factors collectively enhance the efficiency of ODH processes and address selectivity issues.
