[1] "Little success has been achieved in obtaining methanol or formaldehyde in substantial amounts and the main products are CO and CO, even at very low conversion levels."
[2] "In an attempt to understand the role of 0- in the partial oxidation of methane, we investigated both the stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with 0- and the catalytic oxidation of CH4 with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica."
[3] "The stoicheiornetric reaction of CH, with 0- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta- molybdate at pH = 2."
[4] "Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 "C."
[5] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to CH30fI and H2C0 at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the Iiteratre."
[6] "The role of water may be twofold. Pernicone et al.' reported that water retards the oxidation of @H30H to H2CO by 0, over iron molybdate catalysts."
[7] "One cannot, however, exclude the possibility that at elevated temperatures hydroxyl radicals derived from water or Si-OH groups react with CH3- radicals to form CH,OW."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights the complex interplay between various catalysts, including both bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates are addressed through detailed studies of reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The effectiveness of these processes is significantly influenced by the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, thereby enhancing the desired product formation while minimizing unwanted byproducts. The role of water in these reactions is twofold: it can either inhibit secondary reactions or participate in the formation of desired products like methanol through reactions with CH3-O- ions or surface protons. Overall, the collective influence of catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the role of water contribute to the optimization of ODH processes for increased efficiency and selectivity.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的分析中，文献强调了不同催化剂之间复杂的相互作用，包括纯金属氧化物和支撑系统。在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临的挑战通过详细研究反应机制得到解决，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H抽取。这些过程的有效性受到催化剂活性位点隔离能力的影响，从而增强所需产物的形成并减少副产品的产生。水在这些反应中的作用是两面性的：它既可以抑制次级反应，也可以通过与CH3-O-离子或表面质子的反应参与形成目标产品，如甲醇。整体而言，催化剂特性、反应条件以及水的作用共同推动了ODH过程的优化，以提高效率和选择性。
