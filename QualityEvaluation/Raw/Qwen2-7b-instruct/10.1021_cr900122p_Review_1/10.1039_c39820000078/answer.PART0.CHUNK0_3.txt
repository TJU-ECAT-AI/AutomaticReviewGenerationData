1. The partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide over molybdenum oxide supported on silica resulted in the formation of methanol and formaldehyde as major products at a moderate conversion level (16%). However, little success was achieved in obtaining methanol or formaldehyde in substantial amounts, with carbon monoxide and dioxide being the main products even at very low conversion levels. The 0- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N20, were postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction. 

2. In the study, the stoicheiometric reaction of methane with 0- was investigated using a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at pH = 2. The partially reduced catalyst contained MoV on the surface, which upon exposure to N20 gave 8- ions according to reaction (1).

3. Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C. This suggests that the reaction temperature significantly influences the product distribution in the partial oxidation of methane.

4. The use of silica gel as a catalyst was found to be less active compared to molybdenum oxide supported on silica. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol and carbon dioxide at a 16% conversion rate is considered better than previously reported results.

5. Water plays a crucial role in maintaining the selectivities for methanol and carbon dioxide. Increasing the amount of water leads to an increase in the amounts of methanol and carbon dioxide produced, without observing a decrease in activity in the presence of water. This indicates that water might inhibit secondary reactions of both methanol and carbon dioxide, thereby enhancing the selectivity for the desired products.

6. The role of water in the partial oxidation of methane over molybdenum oxide supported on silica might be twofold: it retards the oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide by oxygen over iron molybdate catalysts, and it inhibits secondary reactions of both methanol and carbon dioxide. The formation of methanol might result from the reaction of CH3O- ions with water or surface protons, or from the reaction of hydroxyl radicals derived from water or Si-OH groups with CH3 radicals to form CH3OH.

1. 在氮氧化物氧化甲烷的过程中，使用钼氧化物负载在硅胶上的催化剂，甲醇和甲醛作为主要产物在16%的转化率下形成，但很难获得大量甲醇或甲醛。即使是低转化率下，主要产物也是二氧化碳和一氧化碳。0-离子，由N20表面分解产生，被认为是启动催化过程的活性物种，通过氢原子转移反应。

2. 在实验中，通过将硅胶浸渍到pH=2的七钼酸铵中制备了甲烷与0-的 stoicheiometric反应催化剂。表面部分还原的催化剂含有MoV，当暴露于N20时，会生成8-离子（反应1）。

3. 当脱附温度超过300°C时，观察到主要产物为甲醇。这表明反应温度对甲烷部分氧化产物分布有显著影响。

4. 与二氧化硅相比，二氧化硅负载的钼氧化物作为催化剂的活性较低。在16%转化率下的甲醇和二氧化碳选择性达到60%，这一结果优于文献报道。

5. 水对于保持甲醇和二氧化碳的选择性至关重要。增加水的量导致甲醇和二氧化碳产量增加，而在水存在的情况下没有观察到活性下降。这表明水可能抑制甲醇和二氧化碳的次级反应，从而提高目标产物的选择性。

6. 水在甲烷使用钼氧化物负载在硅胶上的部分氧化中的作用可能有两个方面：它减缓了氧铁钼催化剂上甲醇转化为二氧化碳的过程，并抑制了甲醇和二氧化碳的次级反应。甲醇的形成可能是由于CH3O-离子与水或表面质子的反应，或者是由水或Si-OH基团产生的羟基自由基与CH3自由基反应形成CH3OH。
