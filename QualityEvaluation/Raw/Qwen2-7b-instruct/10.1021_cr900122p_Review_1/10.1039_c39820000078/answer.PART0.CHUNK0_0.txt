1. The study explores the partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide (N20) over molybdenum oxide supported on silica, focusing on the role of oxygen ions (0-) in the process. Methanol and formaldehyde were identified as major products under moderate conversion levels, surpassing carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) yields typically obtained in such reactions.

2. To gain insights into the mechanism involving oxygen ions (0-) in the partial oxidation of methane, the research examines both the stoichiometric reaction of methane with 0- and the catalytic oxidation of methane with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica.

3. At desorption temperatures above 300 °C, methanol emerged as the predominant product in the partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide.

4. The study found that molybdenum oxide supported on silica was significantly more active than silica gel in the catalytic oxidation of methane, showcasing the impact of the support material on catalyst efficiency.

5. Water played a dual role in the catalytic oxidation of methane: it helped maintain high selectivities for methanol and formic acid, while also influencing the amounts of these products, potentially through its ability to inhibit secondary reactions of both methanol and formic acid.

6. The formation of methanol could occur via the reaction of CH30- ions with water or surface protons, as suggested by the observation that zinkoxide ions are produced when C,-C,alkanes interact with 0- ions on magnesium oxide.

7. The possibility exists that at elevated temperatures, hydroxyl radicals derived from water or Si-OH groups could react with CH3- radicals to produce CH,OW, further contributing to the complexity of the reaction pathway.
