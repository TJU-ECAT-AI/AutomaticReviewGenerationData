[1] "The partial oxidation of methane by N,O has been studied extensively, principally in the gas phase."
[2] "Little success has been achieved in obtaining methanol or formaldehyde in substantial amounts and the main products are CO and CO2, even at very low conversion levels."
[3] "The role of 0- in the partial oxidation of methane, we investigated both the stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with 0- and the catalytic oxidation of CH4 with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica."
[4] "Water was introduced from a syringe pump and evaporated in a preheater oven."
[5] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active."
[6] "The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2C0 at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), this study highlights the use of both bulk metal oxides and supported systems as catalysts. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates are discussed, with a focus on the role of various catalysts in the process. The selective formation of methanol through the reaction between 0- and CH4 on Mo/Si02 catalysts is noted, possibly involving the formation of CH30- ions. The interplay between C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction is considered crucial for understanding the reaction mechanism. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing unwanted secondary reactions. The introduction of water is found to be essential for maintaining high selectivities towards methanol and carbon dioxide, influencing the process efficiency positively. This study contributes to the development of more efficient and selective methods for the ODH of alkanes.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），本研究强调了使用块金属氧化物和负载系统作为催化剂。讨论了实现高选择性和转化率的挑战，重点放在各种催化剂在过程中的作用。通过在Mo/Si02催化剂上反应的0-和CH4选择性形成甲醇的观察，指出C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-摘除对理解反应机制至关重要。C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-摘除之间的相互作用被认为是提高选择性的关键。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着重要作用，通过防止不必要的副反应。引入水被发现对于保持高选择性向甲醇和二氧化碳至关重要，这正有利于提高过程效率。本研究为开发更高效、选择性更高的烷烃ODH方法做出了贡献。
