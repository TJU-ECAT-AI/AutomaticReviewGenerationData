1. The study explores the partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide (N20) over molybdenum oxide supported on silica, focusing on the role of oxygen ions (0-) in the process. Methanol and formaldehyde were identified as major products under moderate conversion levels, surpassing carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) yields typically obtained in such reactions.

2. To gain insights into the mechanism involving oxygen ions (0-) in the partial oxidation of methane, the research examines both the stoichiometric reaction of methane with 0- and the catalytic oxidation of methane with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica.

3. At desorption temperatures above 300 °C, methanol emerged as the predominant product in the partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide.

4. The study found that molybdenum oxide supported on silica was significantly more active than silica gel in the catalytic oxidation of methane, showcasing the impact of the support material on catalyst efficiency.

5. Water played a dual role in the catalytic oxidation of methane: it helped maintain high selectivities for methanol and formic acid, while also influencing the amounts of these products, potentially through its ability to inhibit secondary reactions of both methanol and formic acid.

6. The formation of methanol could occur via the reaction of CH30- ions with water or surface protons, as suggested by the observation that zinkoxide ions are produced when C,-C,alkanes interact with 0- ions on magnesium oxide.

7. The possibility exists that at elevated temperatures, hydroxyl radicals derived from water or Si-OH groups could react with CH3- radicals to produce CH,OW, further contributing to the complexity of the reaction pathway.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), this study highlights the use of both bulk metal oxides and supported systems as catalysts. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates are discussed, with a focus on the role of various catalysts in the process. The selective formation of methanol through the reaction between 0- and CH4 on Mo/Si02 catalysts is noted, possibly involving the formation of CH30- ions. The interplay between C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction is considered crucial for understanding the reaction mechanism. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing unwanted secondary reactions. The introduction of water is found to be essential for maintaining high selectivities towards methanol and carbon dioxide, influencing the process efficiency positively. This study contributes to the development of more efficient and selective methods for the ODH of alkanes.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights the complex interplay between various catalysts, including both bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates are addressed through detailed studies of reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The effectiveness of these processes is significantly influenced by the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, thereby enhancing the desired product formation while minimizing unwanted byproducts. The role of water in these reactions is twofold: it can either inhibit secondary reactions or participate in the formation of desired products like methanol through reactions with CH3-O- ions or surface protons. Overall, the collective influence of catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the role of water contribute to the optimization of ODH processes for increased efficiency and selectivity.

1. The partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide over molybdenum oxide supported on silica resulted in the formation of methanol and formaldehyde as major products at a moderate conversion level (16%). However, little success was achieved in obtaining methanol or formaldehyde in substantial amounts, with carbon monoxide and dioxide being the main products even at very low conversion levels. The 0- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N20, were postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction. 

2. In the study, the stoicheiometric reaction of methane with 0- was investigated using a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at pH = 2. The partially reduced catalyst contained MoV on the surface, which upon exposure to N20 gave 8- ions according to reaction (1).

3. Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C. This suggests that the reaction temperature significantly influences the product distribution in the partial oxidation of methane.

4. The use of silica gel as a catalyst was found to be less active compared to molybdenum oxide supported on silica. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol and carbon dioxide at a 16% conversion rate is considered better than previously reported results.

5. Water plays a crucial role in maintaining the selectivities for methanol and carbon dioxide. Increasing the amount of water leads to an increase in the amounts of methanol and carbon dioxide produced, without observing a decrease in activity in the presence of water. This indicates that water might inhibit secondary reactions of both methanol and carbon dioxide, thereby enhancing the selectivity for the desired products.

6. The role of water in the partial oxidation of methane over molybdenum oxide supported on silica might be twofold: it retards the oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide by oxygen over iron molybdate catalysts, and it inhibits secondary reactions of both methanol and carbon dioxide. The formation of methanol might result from the reaction of CH3O- ions with water or surface protons, or from the reaction of hydroxyl radicals derived from water or Si-OH groups with CH3 radicals to form CH3OH.

1. 在氮氧化物氧化甲烷的过程中，使用钼氧化物负载在硅胶上的催化剂，甲醇和甲醛作为主要产物在16%的转化率下形成，但很难获得大量甲醇或甲醛。即使是低转化率下，主要产物也是二氧化碳和一氧化碳。0-离子，由N20表面分解产生，被认为是启动催化过程的活性物种，通过氢原子转移反应。

2. 在实验中，通过将硅胶浸渍到pH=2的七钼酸铵中制备了甲烷与0-的 stoicheiometric反应催化剂。表面部分还原的催化剂含有MoV，当暴露于N20时，会生成8-离子（反应1）。

3. 当脱附温度超过300°C时，观察到主要产物为甲醇。这表明反应温度对甲烷部分氧化产物分布有显著影响。

4. 与二氧化硅相比，二氧化硅负载的钼氧化物作为催化剂的活性较低。在16%转化率下的甲醇和二氧化碳选择性达到60%，这一结果优于文献报道。

5. 水对于保持甲醇和二氧化碳的选择性至关重要。增加水的量导致甲醇和二氧化碳产量增加，而在水存在的情况下没有观察到活性下降。这表明水可能抑制甲醇和二氧化碳的次级反应，从而提高目标产物的选择性。

6. 水在甲烷使用钼氧化物负载在硅胶上的部分氧化中的作用可能有两个方面：它减缓了氧铁钼催化剂上甲醇转化为二氧化碳的过程，并抑制了甲醇和二氧化碳的次级反应。甲醇的形成可能是由于CH3O-离子与水或表面质子的反应，或者是由水或Si-OH基团产生的羟基自由基与CH3自由基反应形成CH3OH。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complex nature of the reactions involved. Catalysts like molybdenum oxide supported on silica have been utilized effectively in ODH processes, as they enable the formation of desired products such as methanol and formaldehyde. However, achieving significant yields of these compounds remains challenging, particularly in the gas phase, where the main products tend to be carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), even at low conversion levels.

The stoichiometric reaction of methane with oxygen (O-) is crucial in understanding the mechanism of ODH. This reaction occurs through a series of steps, including C-H bond activation, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by confining reactive species to specific locations on the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process.

Water is found to be essential in maintaining high selectivities for methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2C0) in the partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide (N2O). Its presence increases the amounts of these products and has not been observed to decrease the activity of the catalyst. The role of water might involve inhibiting secondary reactions of both CH3OH and H2C0, potentially by retarding the oxidation of CH3OH to H2C0 by oxygen over iron molybdate catalysts. This suggests that water's impact on the process is multifaceted, influencing both the primary and secondary reactions involved in ODH.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）分析中，涉及各种催化剂的使用，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统。在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临的挑战通常源于反应的复杂性。如硅胶浸渍的七钼酸铵的使用有效地在ODH过程中利用了钼氧化物，这使得甲醇和甲醛等所需产品的形成成为可能。然而，在气体相中实现这些化合物的显著产率仍然是具有挑战性的，特别是当转化率很低时，主要产物往往为一氧化碳（CO）和二氧化碳（CO2）。

甲烷与氧（O-）的定量反应对于理解ODH机制至关重要。这一反应通过一系列步骤发生，包括C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成以及2H抽取。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着重要作用，通过将反应性物种限制在催化剂表面的特定位置，从而提高过程的效率。

水被发现对于维持甲醇（CH3OH）和二氧化碳（H2C0）在甲烷由硝酸盐氧化（N2O）的部分氧化中的高选择性是必要的。其存在增加了这些产品的量，并且未观察到活性催化剂的减少。水的作用可能涉及抑制CH3OH和H2C0的次级反应，可能通过减慢铁钼酸盐催化剂上CH3OH氧化至H2C0的过程。这表明水对过程的影响是多方面的，影响了ODH过程中涉及的主要和次级反应。
