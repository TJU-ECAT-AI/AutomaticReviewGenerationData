Spectroscopic findings indicate the speciation of the active phase into isolated Fe3+ species, oligomeric 2-d FeOx patches, and 3-d Fe2O3 nanoparticles, characterised by decreasing interaction strength with silica carrier. The reduction pattern of the above surface structures has been probed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements, and a deconvolution analysis of spectra allowed the concentra- tion of the various surface species to be highlighted. The catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of CH4 to HCHO with oxygen (MPO) has been systematically evaluated by batch (BR) and continuous-flow (CF) measurements in the range of 400750 C. Direct relationships among Fe dispersion and specific atomic rate of CH4 conversion (FeCH4, s1) and HCHO formation (FeHCHO, s1) confirm the superior catalytic performance of AP systems. After a poor reactivity of isolated species and the unselective behaviour of 3-d Fe2O3 particles,2-d oligomeric patches feature the best catalytic pattern, owing to an optimum FeO bond strength. Sintering and surface reconstructuring phenomena affect the catalyst stability during the MPO reaction. 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
The direct conversion of natural gas (NG) streams into commodity chemical products actually constitutes one of the hottest topics in catalysis, since potential process routes em- ploying novel catalytic approaches in combination with low- cost feedstocks could result in significant economic advan- tages over current technologies [1,2].

C5 alkanes in both the scientific and patent literature [112],a low process productivity still remains the most significant shortcoming for industrial exploitation [15]. Furthermore,the partial oxidation of methane to oxygenates does not obey some rules for the selective activation of C2C5 alkanes [15].
Several studies in recent years have indicated a superior functionality of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts in the partial oxida- tion of methane to formaldehyde (MPO), though it has been argued that the structure of Fe3+ centres determines their activityselectivity pattern [611]. Specifically, iso- lated Fe3+ moieties assist selective oxidation paths leading 0021-9517/$  see front matter 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc. doi:10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.029 366

to oxygenated products, whereas Fe2O3 aggregates and/or (nano)particles mostly yield COx because of a high avail- ability of lattice oxygen ions driving the further oxidation of intermediates [611]. Then in addition to catalyst formu- lations involving silica as a carrier of transition-metal ions (Mo, V, Fe, etc.) [39,1214], stoichiometric compounds such as Fe2(MoO4)3 and FePO4, in which the counteran- ion acts as a spacer for isolation of the active Fe3+ redox centres, were also found to be effective catalysts for the oxy-functionalisation of CH4 [4,15]. In fact, both theoretical considerations [2,12] and experimental findings [112,1518] convey that a proper catalyst design must en- sure a high dispersion (e.g., site isolation) of suitable transition-metal ions (e.g., V, Mo, Fe) over a matrix featur- ing a weak Brnsted-type acidity.
Furthermore, previous studies of the catalyst steady state by reaction temperature O2 chemisorption measurements (RTOC) allowed the mechanism and kinetics of the MPO on silica-based catalysts to be highlighted [2,12,1921].
According to recognised principles of oxidation catalysis [2,12,16] and ab initio calculations of the energetic bar- rier for CH4 activation on the FeO+ complex [17,18], we developed a formal kinetic model describing in detail the steady-state conditions and the activity-selectivity pattern of low-loaded FeOx/SiO2 catalysts [2,12,1921]. Because of the second-order dependence of CH4 conversion and a first-order inverse dependence of HCHO selectivity on con- centration of active sites, respectively [2,12,21], we pointed out that process productivity (STY) can be enhanced by a rise in the dispersion of Fe3+ ions across a silica matrix,leading to the exploitation of alternative synthesis routes [2,912].
The physico-chemical and catalytic properties [2232] of supported iron oxide systems have been widely investigated,and a peculiar reactivity has generally been documented concomitantly with a high dispersion of the active phase [8,23,28,30,31]. A high, although selective, catalytic func- tionality of FeOx-supported systems has been found in the SCR of NOx [23,25], in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol [31] and ethylbenzene to styrene [32]. That close relationship between the structure and reactivity of the ac- tive phase compelled the adoption of special preparation methods, such as ion exchange [2224,2629] and CVD [25,26,28], to attain a homogeneous dispersion of Fe3+ ions mostly across zeolite-type matrices.
Therefore, this paper highlights the reliability of the adsorptionprecipitation route (AP) [2,912] in promot- ing the dispersion of low-loaded (1507300 ppm Fe) FeOx/ SiO2 catalysts. A basic assessment of the effects of prepa- ration route and Fe loading on the speciation and redox features of the active phase makes it possible to predict in a detailed way the catalytic pattern of low-loaded FeOx/SiO2 systems in MPO according to the density, structure, and re- activity of surface FeOx species. The catalytic efficiency of the various surface structures and the occurrence of catalyst deactivation phenomena are also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
2.1.1. Catalysts
Two commercial precipitated SiO2 samples, F5 and Si 4-5P (Akzo Nobel), were used for the preparation of sev- eral FeOx/SiO2 catalysts by incipient wetness (IW) and adsorptionprecipitation (AP) routes, respectively. The former were obtained by stepwise addition of Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solutions (pH 2.5) to powder silica carriers, and AP systems were prepared according to the following proce- dure [2,912]. An aqueous suspension of powder silica, put into a three-necked bottle, was kept at room temperature un- der continuous nitrogen flow (100 STP cm3 min1) and stirring (600 rpm) to remove oxygen, avoiding any further air admission. Then, an amount of FeSO4 corresponding to the designed Fe loading was added to the suspension, the pH of which was gradually raised to 78 by dropwise addi- tion of a concentrated NH4OH solution. The suspension was kept at the final pH value (with stirring and N2 bubbling) for 1 h, during which the quantitative adsorption (>98%) of FeII ions was attained. Afterwards, the solid was filtered and repeatedly washed with bi-distilled water.
Two aliquots of F5 (S1) and Si 4-5P (S2) silica were subjected to the above impregnation steps without any Fe precursors in the solution, to obtain respective blank sam- ples.
All of the samples were dried at 100 C and then calcined at 600 C for 6 h in air. A list of samples, along with the relative preparation methods, Fe loading (wt ppm), BET sur- face area value (SABET, m2/g), and specific surface loading (SSL, Feat nm2), are given in Table 1. Sample designations (F[xxxx]Sy-zz) take into account the silica carrier (S1 or S2), Fe loading [wt ppm], and preparation method (F[xxxx]Sy- IW and F[xxxx]Sy-AP), referred to as IW and AP routes,respectively.
2.2. Methods
UVVis diffuse reflectance (DR UVVis) spectroscopy measurements were performed on fine powders of the samples put into a cell with optical quartz walls, perma- nently connected to a vacuum line (residual pressure: 1.0 × 106 Torr; 1 Torr = 133.33 Pa). The spectra were collected with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 instrument equipped with an integrating sphere and Ultra-White Teflon as a reference material.
Mssbauer 57Fe spectra were recorded at room tempera- ture (20 C) and at liquid He temperature (269 C) with both the 57Co/Rh source and absorber at the same tem- perature. The spectrometer was operated with a sinusoidal velocity waveform, and the spectra were fitted by superim- position of appropriate sets of Lorentzian lines, with the use of MOS-90 PC software [33].

sextet, an asymmetric Gaussian distribution of the hyper- fine field was allowed for. The resulting parameters, such as average magnetic hyperfine field Bhf, electric quadru- pole splitting QS, isomer shift IS (relative to α-Fe2O3), Lorentzian linewidth (LW), and resonance area, A, as a per- centage of the Fe content, are taken into account.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was performed with a linear quartz microreactor (i.d. 4 mm) fed with a 6% H2/Ar reducing mixture flowing at 30 STP cm3 min1, timely purified of any O2 and H2O. Mea- surements were carried out in the range of 200800 C with a heating rate of 20 C min1, with an amount of cata- lyst corresponding to an Fe load of ca. 0.2 mg, to ensure differential H2 consumption rates. Before measurements all the catalyst samples were treated in situ at 600 C for 30 min under a 10% O2/He flow. The H2 consumption was monitored by a TCD connected by a ChromCard (Fisons In- struments) to a PC for data storage and processing, and the response was quantitatively calibrated from the TPR area of known amounts of CuO. Under such conditions, TPR data were reproducible in terms of both peak maximum position (10 C) and extent of hydrogen consumption (10%).
Modelling of TPR spectra has been performed by de- convolution analysis of experimental profiles by a linear combination of Gaussian components [3436], with the use of the PeakFit software package (Jandel Scientific).
Catalyst testing in the MPO under differential conversion conditions was performed with a recirculation batch reac- tor (BR) operating at 650 C and 1.71 bar [8,9,19,20], at a total flow rate of 1000 STP cm3 min1 (He:N2:CH4:O2 =
6:1:2:1) and with a catalyst sample of 0.05 g, unless other-
wise specified.
The performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts has been also evaluated under integral conversion conditions by conti- nuous-flow (CF) temperature-programmed catalytic reaction tests in the range of 400750 C [13], with the use of a quartz micro-reactor (i.d. 4 mm) containing 0.05 g of catalyst fed with a reaction mixture (CH4, 20%; O2, 10%; He, 70%) flowing at 50 STP cm3 min1, unless otherwise specified.
The temperature was ramped at rate of 10 C min1, en- abling a continuous scanning of reaction stream with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermolab, Fisons Instru- ments) connected to the reactor by a heated (180 C) inlet capillary system [13].
3. Results
3.1. Characterisation of the fresh catalysts
3.1.1. DR UVVis spectroscopy
The first, though qualitative, evidence of the rather dif- ferent efficiencies of the employed preparation routes in promoting the iron dispersion on silica carriers stems from the different colours of the AP and IW catalysts. Whereas a typical brownish dye of the former signals the presence of Fe2O3 aggregates at any loading (0.10.43 wt% Fe), AP samples look colourless up to a loading of 0.73 wt% (F[7300]S1-AP). However, a basic evaluation of the iron dis- persion on the various catalysts can be made on the basis of the DR UVVis spectra of the calcined samples outgassed at room temperature (room temperature) (shown in Fig. 1).
Under such conditions Fe ions are expected to have an octahedral coordination (e.g., six ligands corresponding to oxygen atoms of the support and adsorbed water/hydroxyls),and, after the calcination at 600 C, their ON must be +3 [2730].
DR UVVis spectra for the bare S2 (a) and S1 (a) sup- ports are shown in Fig. 1A, including also the spectra of the F[1000]S2-IW (b), F[4300]S2-IW (c), and F[4200]S1- IW (d) catalysts. In the case of the silica support, a main band at 42,500 cm1, two weaker and overlapped compo- nents at 36,500 and 32,500 cm1, and a broad tail span- ning the 30,00015,000 cm1 range, are observed (Fig. 1A,spectrum a). These absorptions can be attributed to charge transfer (CT) transitions involving titanium and iron ions contained as impurities [27,37]. Both isolated Ti4+ and Fe3+ in (distorted) tetrahedral coordination located in the SiO2 bulk could be responsible for the main signal at 42,500 cm1 [27,37]. Notably, isolated Fe3+ ions in a (distorted) octa- 368

All the samples have been outgassed at room temperature for 1 h. hedral symmetry at the surface of silica particles, where they can expand their ligand sphere by adsorbing water molecules, can also contribute significantly to this band, pre- senting a partner component at 36,500 cm1 [38]. This latter absorption, however, might also be a monitor of the pres- ence of surface isolated Ti4+ ions in (distorted) octahedral coordination [39]. Finally, the shoulder at 32,500 cm1 and the lower frequency tail can be attributed to TiOx and FeOx aggregates, ranging from cluster-like species to nanopar- ticles; the corresponding electronic absorption decreases in energy as their size increases [40].
For the F[1000]S2-IW sample, the overall absorption intensity increases ca. 2.5 times, and the spectral pro- file is dominated by a broad band with a maximum at 41,000 cm1, which is asymmetric on the lower frequency side and is accompanied by a weak tail in the range of 30,00015,000 cm1 (Fig. 1A, spectrum b). The main com- ponent at 41,000 cm1 is assignable to the most intense CT band of isolated Fe3+ ions in octahedral coordina- tion (the six ligands are oxygen atoms of the support and adsorbed water molecules/hydroxyls), with an associated weaker partner in the 37,00035,000 cm1 range [38,41].
The remaining part of the absorption profile at lower fre- quency reveals the presence of Fe3+ species in the form of oxidic dimers/oligomers (38,00025,000 cm1) and 3-d Fe2O3 particles (25,00010,000 cm1) [27,42].
The components related to isolated Fe3+ species appear to be strongly reduced in intensity in the spectrum of the F[4300]S2-IW sample, whereas the intensity of absorptions due to aggregated species is significantly enhanced, thus be- coming the dominant feature (Fig. 1A, spectrum c). The heavy shoulder at ca. 20,000 cm1 monitors the massive presence of nanometric Fe2O3 particles, after the spectrum of a silica-diluted hematite powder with an average particle size of 3 nm (Fig. 1A; see inset). A corresponding decrease in absorption due to isolated species indicates that the addi- tion of large amounts of Fe by IW involves a high degree of agglomeration of Fe3+ ions.
The effect of the specific surface area of the silica car- rier on dispersion of the iron species can be assessed by a comparison of the spectra of the similarly loaded F[4300]S2- IW (Fig. 1A, spectrum c) and F[4200]S1-IW (Fig. 1A,spectrum d) system. With respect to catalyst supported on S2, the F[4200]S1-IW sample exhibits a spectrum dom- inated by a complex absorption with maxima at 43,000 and 39,000 cm1, resulting from overlapping components of iso- lated octahedral Fe3+ species and octahedral Fe3+ species in the form of oxidic dimers/oligomers, indicating a better dis- persion of iron in this case.
For the differently loaded catalysts prepared via the AP method on S1 silica (Fig. 1B), the DR UVVis patterns ap- pear in any case to be dominated by a main component located at a frequency higher than 40,000 cm1, even for a Fe loading of 0.73 wt% (Fig. 1B, spectrum d). This indicates that well-dispersed Fe3+ ions in an octahedral coordination are present on such systems. However, a regular shift of the absorption maximum from ca. 45,000 to 40,500 cm1 sig- nals a rising degree of nuclearity of the iron species as the loading increases.
3.1.2. 57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy
The 57Fe Mssbauer spectra of the F[4300]S2-IW (A) and F[7300]S1-AP (B) samples at room temperature (spec- trum a) and at liquid helium temperature (spectrum b) are shown in Fig. 2, and the related parameters are summarised in Table 2. In the case of the Fe[4300]S2-IW sample, the spectrum at room temperature exhibits a simple quadru- pole doublet with hyperfine parameters typical of trivalent paramagnetic iron ions in a slightly distorted octahedral environment (Fig. 2A, a), which is transformed almost com- pletely into a six-line pattern at 269 C (Fig. 2A, b),indicating that almost all of the iron is present in the form of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with an average size of ca. 8 nm [43]. Although the hyperfine parameters of

All the samples have been outgassed at room temperature for 1 h. this magnetic sextet are slightly different from those of bulk crystalline α-Fe2O3 [44], previous studies on FeOx/SiO2 systems, bearing a higher Fe loading, suggest that this discrepancy could result either from the nano-size of the α- Fe2O3 crystals or from an amorphous character of Fe2O3 particles [45].
The spectrum at room temperature of the Fe[7300]S1-AP sample consists of an asymmetric quadrupole doublet, which can be fitted with two Fe(III) components with different QS (Fig. 2B, a), as shown in Table 2. At 269 C, the coex- istence of a quadrupole doublet and a magnetic pattern is observed (Fig. 2B, b). In particular, the resonance area of the magnetic component corresponds to ca. 50% of the overall spectrum, indicating that only about half of the iron content is in the form of superparamagnetic iron oxide species.
3.1.3. Temperature-programmed reduction
TPR profiles (normalised to the integral peak area) of dif- ferently loaded FeOx/SiO2 catalysts, prepared by AP or IW methods on both F5 and Si 4-5P silicas, are comparatively shown in Fig. 3. Quantitative hydrogen consumption data,expressed as the number of H2 molecules consumed per Fe atom (H2/Fe), signal in any case a H2/Fe ratio close to 0.5 (e.g., 0.420.56), thus denoting a strong inhibiting effect of the matrix on the reduction of Fe2+ ions to Fe0.
The influence of the Fe loading on the reduction pattern of F[xxxx]S1-AP catalysts is shown in Fig. 3A. The bare S1 370

All the spectra are normalised with reference to the integral peak area. silica sample (Fig. 3A, a) features a TPR profile spanning the range of 400800 C, which accounts for the reduction of Fe3+ impurities (150 ppm) to Fe2+. From a qualitative point of view, a main reduction peak with a broad maximum at ca. 570 C dominates such a spectrum, with other weakly resolved maxima at ca. 400 and 700 C also present. The ad- dition of ca. 0.08% Fe by AP (F[1000]S1-AP) yields a rise in the reduction kinetics at T < 600 C and the appearance of two resolved maxima at 365 and 490 C. At higher Fe load- ings, the reduction profiles of the FeOx/SiO2 catalysts retain the qualitative features of the previous system, though peak maxima shift further to lower T . At the highest Fe loading (0.73 wt%), the TPR spectrum of the F[7300]S1-AP sam- ple displays one broad asymmetric peak centred at 409 C with a tail of H2 consumption on the high-temperature side,pointing to the presence of several unresolved components in the range of 500800 C.The effects of the preparation method and silica car- rier on the reduction pattern of similarly loaded (0.37
0.43 wt%) FeOx/SiO2 catalysts are illustrated in Figs. 3B
and C, comparing the TPR profiles of F[3700]S1-AP (b) and F[4200]S1-IW (c) samples (Fig. 3B) with those of coun- terpart F[3700]S2-AP (b) and F[4300]S2-IW (c) samples (Fig. 3C). Like the similar Fe loading (Table 1), the S2 silica (Fig. 3C, a) features a reduction pattern analogous to that of the S1 carrier (Fig. 3B, a), also resulting in a H2/Fe ratio close to 0.5. As a rule, IW catalysts (Figs. 3B and C, profiles b) display an enhanced reduction rate at lower temperature with respect to similarly loaded F[3700]S1-AP and F[3700]S2-AP (Figs. 3B and C, profiles c), whereas,in comparison, the rate of H2 consumption at T > 500 C of samples based on S1 silica is systematically higher than that of counterpart S2, indicating some influence of the sil- ica support on the reduction of the active phase, mostly at loadings higher than 0.1 wt%.
3.2. Catalyst testing
3.2.1. BR activity data
The effects of the preparation method and Fe loading on the MPO performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts have been evaluated by isothermal (650 C) BR tests at differential conversion per pass conditions (τ, 3.3 × 103 s). Activity data, with reference to S1 and S2 silica supports, are pre- sented in Table 3 in terms of hourly CH4 conversion (Xh, %),product selectivity (SX, %), reaction rate (molCH4 s1 g1),space time yield (STYHCHO, gkg1 cat h1), and specific Fe atomic rate (s1) of CH4 conversion (FeCH4) and HCHO for- mation (FeHCHO, FeCH4 × SHCHO).
Regardless of the preparation method and loading, Fe addition always results in a promoting effect of the intrin- sic reactivity of any silica carrier [2,58,12,15], though it is fairly evident that the AP route generally permits a superior performance in MPO [912].
The bare S1 silica runs with an hourly CH4 conver- sion of 2.7% and a SHCHO equal to 66%, corresponding to a reaction rate of 2.8 mol g1 s1 and a STYHCHO of 200 gkg1 cat h1. The S2 silica carrier, with both higher activ- ity (XCH4,h, 3.8%) and SHCHO (75%), ensures a STYHCHO of 310 gkg1 cat h1. Normalised to the Fe content (Table 1),

a Catalyst testing at tenfold lower contact time (wcat, 0.005 g). however, the two silica samples feature analogous FeCH4 (1.051.06 s1) and FeHCHO (0.660.75 s1) values.
The addition of ca. 0.10 wt% Fe to the Si 4-5P car- rier by IW (F[1000]S2-IW) implies a threefold rise in ac- tivity (XCH4,h, 9.9%) counterbalanced by a lowering in SHCHO from 75 to 54%. Though there is a significant rise in STYHCHO (580 gkg1 cat h1), the above figures account for a decrease in FeCH4 to 0.50 s1 and, mostly, in the FeHCHO value (0.27 s1) with reference to the S2 carrier.
The same amount of Fe (0.1 wt%) put on the F5 silica by IW (F[1000]S1-IW) attains a similar effect on activity (XCH4,h, 8.6%) and selectivity (SHCHO, 55%), also in terms of FeCH4 and FeHCHO (Table 3). The addition of 0.43 wt% Fe to S2 silica, still by the IW route, has a strongly neg- ative impact on the MPO functionality of the FeOx/SiO2 system, as the F[4300]S2-IW attains a Xh of 7.8%, result- ing in a very low FeCH4 value (0.14 s1), coupled to a SHCHO of 47%. These figures account for a STYHCHO of only 405 gkg1 cat h1 and a FeHCHO value (0.06 s1) that is lower by about one order of magnitude than that of the F[1000]S2-IW sample.
The F[1000]S1-AP catalyst, bearing 0.1 wt% Fe on F5 silica by AP, is much more active (Xh, 14.6%) and se- lective (SHCHO, 63%) than previous ones, featuring FeCH4 (0.84 s1) and FeHCHO (0.53 s1) values comparable to those of silica carriers and attaining a remarkable STYHCHO of 1,020 gkg1 cat h1. A Fe content (3700 ppm) similar to that of the F[4300]S2-IW sample, added to S2 silica by AP (F[3700]S2-AP), yields an activity (Xh, 37.2%) five- fold larger than that of the counterpart IW sample, cor- responding to an FeCH4 value of 0.57 s1. In spite of the high conversion level, this catalyst ensures a SHCHO of 33%, accounting for a STYHCHO of 1350 gkg1 cat h1 and a FeHCHO value of 0.19 s1. With FeCH4 (0.53 s1), FeHCHO (0.19 s1), and STYHCHO (1360 gkg1 cat h1) values com- parable to those of the homologous F[3700]S2-AP, activity data for the F[3700]S1-AP system confirm a slight, if any,effect of the silica carrier on activity, also at higher loading of the active phase.

The catalytic pattern of the most active F[3700]S2-AP and F[7300]S1-AP samples was also probed at a tenfold lower contact time (τ, 3.3 × 104 s) to avoid kinetic limita- tions imposed by high O2 conversion [2,1921] and compare their performance at conversion levels similar to those of less active catalysts (Table 3). Under such conditions the two catalysts feature similar Xh (4.64.8%) and SHCHO (54 55%) values corresponding to STYHCHO values equal to 28002900 gkg1 cat h1 [912,46].
At the least the influence of the preparation method on stability was evaluated by a comparison of the relative activ- ity α (e.g., the ratio between activity at time t, Xh,t, and time zero, Xh,0) of AP and IW catalysts during t.o.s. Depend- ing on the preparation method, a different stability pattern is recorded, as shown in Fig. 4, comparing representative data for the F[3700]S1-AP and F[4300]S2-IW samples. That is,while the latter catalyst keeps both activity and selectivity substantially stable throughout the test, the former under- goes a ca. 20% activity loss with a concomitant decrease in SHCHO (from 36 to 30%) after 6 h of t.o.s. Notably, this re- sulted a common pattern for all AP catalysts and IW samples with Fe loading less than 0.4 wt%. 372

3.2.2. CF activity data
Integral activity data in the range of 400750 C (τ,
6.6 × 102 s) are compared in Table 4 in terms of tempera-
ture of 1% (T1%), 2% (T2%), and 5% (T5%) CH4 conversion, HCHO selectivity (SHCHO), and apparent activation energy values (Eapp, kJ/mol), calculated in the CH4 conversion range of 110%.
The S2 carrier attains 1% CH4 conversion at 620 C with a SHCHO equal to 48%, prompting 2 and 5% conver- sion levels at 650 C (SHCHO, 43%) and 710 C (SHCHO,35%), respectively. These mirror an apparent activation en- ergy value of 142 kJ/mol [2,20], resulting the highest in the series (Table 4).
In agreement with BR data, the higher activity of AP catalysts emerges from a shift of all of the conversion levels to lower temperature (Table 3), consistently with a decrease in the activation energy (Eapp, 83101 kJ/mol).
The F[1000]S1-AP and F[1000]S2-IW samples feature a similar catalytic pattern, denoted by the attainment of 1% CH4 conversion (T1%) and an analogous SHCHO (2527%) at 500520 C. Mirroring a similar drop in the Eapp (82 88 kJ/mol), both T2% and T5% are also shifted to lower temperature by ca. 100 C, and the SHCHO decreases to 2022 and 1820%, respectively. The addition of higher Fe loadings (0.370.59 wt%) to F5 silica by AP, shifts the conversion levels further to the same lower temperature (450460 C), and, though the SHCHO decreases to 912%,no changes in the Eapp (8385 kJ/mol) are noticed. Mean- while, CF data for the F[3700]S2-AP sample confirm the minor influence of the silica carrier on the MPO activity of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts (Table 4). In contrast, the F[4300]S2- IW sample displays the highest Tx% values, along with the lowest SHCHO values in the series and, consequently,the resulting Eapp (101 kJ/mol) is between the highest (142 kJ/mol) and the lowest (8288 kJ/mol) values found for S2 and AP catalysts, respectively.
The performance of AP systems has been also probed un- der oxygen-lean conditions with a feed of a 90% CH4/2.3% O2/7.7% He reaction mixture and a constant contact time (τ, 6.6 × 102 s). In spite of the high CH4/O2 ratio (40) hindering the reaction kinetics [2,1921], the F[1000]S1- AP sample attains 1% (525 C) and 2% (570 C) conversion levels at a temperature slightly higher than at standard con- ditions (CH4/O2, 2), whereas a more than twofold rise in SHCHO (54 and 49%) accounts for STYHCHO values of 360 and 650 gkg1 cat h1 at 525 and 570 C, respectively.
A larger shift of both T1% and T2% to higher temperature (Table 4) does not affect a similar increase in SHCHO on the F[3700]S1-AP sample (Table 4).
3.3. Characterisation of the treated and used
catalysts
3.3.1. TPR of catalysts pretreated (650 C) with CH4 and
CH4/O2 reaction mixture flow The TPR profiles of F[3700]S1-AP (A) and F[4300]S2- IW (B) catalysts, pretreated for 5 min at 650 C under flowing CH4 (top), are compared with the corresponding profiles of the calcined samples (bottom) in Fig. 5A. Regard- less of the preparation method and Fe loading, the treatment of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts at 650 C with methane causes a marked decrease in the TPR signal in the T range of 350 650 C, evidently diagnostic of an extensive reduction of Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ by the substrate. This reflects significant changes in the respective reduction profile, no longer show- ing the typical features of the calcined systems.
Furthermore, the reduction patterns of the used F[3700]S1-AP and F[4300]S2-IW catalysts have been com- pared with the relative spectra of fresh samples in Fig. 5B.
The TPR profile of the used F[3700]S1-AP catalyst shows marked changes in the reduction kinetics, evidently diagnos- tic of a deep reconstructuring of the active phase, whereas only a slight decrease in the rate of H2 consumption on the rising side of the main TPR peak is noticed for the F[4300]S2-IW system. As a consequence, the TPR spectra for the used systems look similar to each other, repro- ducing, in turn, almost unchanged the main features of the fresh F[4300]S2-IW sample.

4. Discussion
4.1. Structure of low-loaded FeOx/SiO2 catalysts
Although a relatively poor concentration and reactivity of the hydroxyl population in comparison with other ox- ide supports (e.g., alumina, titania, zirconia, etc.), yet, at a molecular scale the silica surface exhibits some chemi- cal affinity for supported metal atoms and/or ions [47,48],along with some reactivity towards gas phases [2,3,13,49].
Molecular dispersion, then, entails a hard reducibility of supported species, owing to the electron-withdrawal effect exerted by the oxygen-bridged bonds, the extent of which depends upon the structure of guest hollow sites of the sil- ica surface [22,30,47,48,50,51]. On the basis of Mssbauer, IR spectroscopy, and volumetric/gravimetric adsorptions,then, Dumesic et al. argued that two states of Fe2+ exist in a reduced 1 wt% Fe/SiO2 catalyst: Fe2+ strongly inter- acting with the support and Fe2+ in small particles of iron oxide [22]. They stressed that the former should be present as thin rafts on the support, holding mostly Fe2+ in a low coordination, whereas high-coordinated Fe2+ are present at the surface of iron oxide particles [22]. A strong interac- tion with silica hinders the reduction of both to the metallic state [22], involving also Si4+/Fe3+ lattice substitution(s) in tetrahedral sites of the magnetite structure [50].
In fact, the stabilisation of Fe2O3 particles, oxide nano- clusters, isolated iron ions, and oxygen-bridged iron ions does not depend upon the oxide support, being a function of preparation method [2228,30], loading [2225,30,51],and thermal treatments [2230]. In this context, the chem- istry of iron and oxide support in aqueous solution plays an essential role. That is, avoiding an uncontrolled precip- itation of the iron hydroxide (i.e., pKs Fe(OH)3 = 38 vs. pKs Fe(OH)2 = 12) and exploiting the selective inter- action of negatively charged silanolate groups with Fe2+ cations at pH > pHZPC, the AP route favours an effective dispersion of Fe2+ ions all over the SiO2 surface [2,912] according to the DR UVVis absorption pattern, monitoring the prevailing contribution of isolated and oligomeric FeIIIOx species in the F[xxxx]S1-AP series (Fig. 1B). How- ever, the shift of the absorption maximum, as the loading increases, signals a growing degree of aggregation of the surface FeOx species, forming 2-d patches over the silica surface [22,2729]. In contrast, despite a SSL comparable with that of the F[5900]S1-AP sample (Table 1), an absorp- tion fairly shifted to lower wavenumbers and the intense absorption in the 20,00010,000 cm1 range (Fig. 1A, spec- trum c) denote that Fe2O3 particles are largely present on the F[4300]S2-IW system, as a consequence of the lack of any effective interaction between silica and Fe3+ ions through- out IW impregnation [812].
Thus, indicating a close relationship between dispersion and redox properties of the active phase, the marked shift of the main TPR maximum from 570580 to ca. 400 C, go- ing from bare silica to F[4300]S2-IW, F[3700]S2-AP and F[7300]S1-AP samples (Fig. 3), then monitors the reduc- tion of Fe3+ ions belonging to various surface structures.
And so a systematic comparison of UVvis and TPR features indicates that the reduction of isolated Fe moieties, char- acterised by the strongest interaction with the support, falls in the temperature window of 550750 C, where the contri- bution of several components is evident from TPR profiles of silica carriers (Fig. 3, profiles a). Such species drive the redox cycle with the substrate [2,8,12,16,19,20,36], being then responsible for the effective catalytic pattern of pre- cipitated silica [13,36,49]. At the opposite tendency, the spectroscopic results for the F[4300]S2-IW sample signal an almost quantitative contribution of hematite nanoparticles,the reduction of which matches a symmetric peak centred at ca. 400 C (Fig. 3C, profile b). Therefore, a weaker interac- tion with the silica matrix of Fe3+ ions therein prompts an easier reducibility with a rising degree of aggregation of the active phase [6,7,9,11,2228]. Mirroring a variable contri- bution of various surface structures, then, the TPR profiles of the FeOx/SiO2 system bear quantitative information on the abundance of the various surface structures that is un- available from spectroscopic measurements. For instance,while the TPR pattern of the F[4300]S2-IW sample (Fig. 3C,profile b) matches satisfactorily with spectroscopic findings, Mssbauer data for the F[7300]S1-AP sample indicate that a significant fraction (ca. 50%) of the active phase is in the form of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, the presence of which is barely visible, if at all, from the relative UVvis absorp- tion pattern (Fig. 1B, profile d). Since deconvolution of TPR spectra previously made it possible to highlight the structure of supported V2O5 [35,36] and MoO3 [34,36] catalysts, an analogous approach was adopted in the attempt to assess the speciation of the active phase in the FeOx/SiO2 system.
4.2. Speciation and dispersion of the active phase
According to previous EPR [8] and FTIR data for ad- sorbed NO [46,52], spectroscopic findings suggest that the TPR pattern of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts monitors the cumula- tive reduction of the following surface structures:(i) Isolated FeIII ions located on different hollow sites of the carrier, with a different degree of surface coordina- tion [611,46,52];(ii) 2-d aggregated FeIII species, forming thin rafts/ patches on the silica surface [22,46,52];(iii) 3-d Fe2O3 particles, the reduction of which depends mostly on crystal size [611,22,46,52].
Interaction strength, with matrix, spatial structure, and coordination environment, controls the reducibility of FeIII ions in the above surface species [11,46,51,52]. Then the adopted modelling procedure implies that, at a given tem- perature, the rate of catalyst reduction results from the cumulative contribution of the various surface species, char- acterised by a normal distribution of the activation energy

for reduction [3436,52]. In fact, by a preliminary iterative procedure it was found that all of the TPR profiles can be described by a linear combination of five Gaussian peaks,with the same centre position (M, C) and full width at half- maximum (fwhm, C), and only a variable intensity (A, %) [11,3436,52]. Representative results for TPR spectra mod- elling are shown in Fig. 6, displaying the deconvoluted TPR spectra of differently loaded S1-supported AP systems (see Fig. 3A). The parameters of the Gaussian components used for the deconvolution of all TPR spectra are summarised in Table 5. Although a scale factor of ca. 50 in the iron concentration (Table 1), implying remarkable differences in the sample loading (25500 mg) throughout TPR measure- ments, likely explains some variations in M (20 C) and fwhm (8 C) values (Table 5), the fact that the same com- ponent keeps an unchanged centre position and fwhm can be taken as a reliable index of the same nature (and interac- tion path) of the various Fe3+ species with silica regardless of preparation route, Fe loading, and silica carrier [3436].
Then the following attribution can be inferred.
The first component (peak 1) centred at ca. 400 C moni- tors the reduction of 3-d aggregates, mostly in the form of Fe2O3 nanoclusters.
The second component (peak 2), with the maximum at ca. 500 C, would be associated with the reduction of 2-d (FeOFe)n patches (i.e., thin rafts) linked to the silica surface by a network of FeOSi bonds and, thus, result- ing in less reducibility than that of oxide nanoclusters.
The third (peak 3) and fourth (peak 4) components, cen- tred at ca. 600 and 700 C, respectively, match with a poor reducibility of isolated Fe3+ ions in a Td-like coordination [69,11,46,51,52]. Their reducibility depends upon the num- ber of FeOSi linkages in the first coordinative shell and, thus, on location across different hollow sites of the silica surface [47,48]. Indeed, previous FTIR data for ad- sorbed NO indicated that only mono-nitrosyls form at an Fe loading of ca. 1000 ppm (F[1000]S1-AP), whereas at higher loadings (F[3700]S1-AP) both mono- and tri-nitrosyl adducts form on FeII ions belonging to mono/oligomeric moieties [46]. These results have been rationalised by con- sidering that a number of structures exist on the surface of the supports [47,48], depending on the location in smaller or large (SiO2)n rings. The fewer oxygen atoms in the for- mer, because of their propinquity, tend to strongly stabilise entrapped Fe3+ ions. As a consequence, these structures are the first to graft incoming Fe ions at lower loading,by ensuring a higher shielding. Large rings accommodate transition-metal ions only at higher loading, implying an en- hanced coordinative unsaturation. Thus isolated Fe3+ ions,bearing multiple surface oxygen bridged bonds and located in smaller hollow sites, are the most resistant to reduction and can therefore be associated with the fourth component.
A higher degree of coordinative unsaturation of isolated FeIII ions located in larger hollow sites implies an easier reducibil- ity and can be then associated with the third component.
Perhaps, such an assignment explains the fact that Dume- sic et al. could not detect isolated Fe2+ ions in a 1% Fe/SiO2 catalyst reduced at 500 C, but rather Fe2+ ions of low coordination in some 2-d thin rafts along with high- coordination Fe2+ ions of 3-d Fe2O3 clusters [22]. 376

Fig. 6. Modelling of TPR spectra of F[xxxx]S1-AP catalysts (see Fig. 3A).
Concerning the zeroth component, its fate with load- ing and preparation method makes the relative assignation less straightforward, and hence requiring specific reason- ing. That is, it is almost absent on systems with a very low (1000 ppm) Fe loading, where the presence of Fe2O3 ag- gregates is also rather poor (Table 5). Its relative intensity rises abruptly to ca. 22% of that of the Fe2O3 component,remaining almost unchanged (25%) up to the F[7300]S1- AP catalyst (Table 5). Moreover, at a comparable Fe loading,the intensity ratio of the 0th and first components on IW sys- tems is quite lower than on counterpart AP systems, whereas for the same preparation route, F5 supported systems feature a higher value of this ratio (Table 5). Finally, the F[4300]S2- IW features the lowest value (8%) of the above ratio. These findings suggest that the 0th peak is somewhat related to the dispersion of oxide aggregates, thus belonging to reduction of Fe3+ ions at the surface of oxide nanoparticles, though it could also refer to some intermediate (e.g., Fe3O4) reduction step.
By this account, the speciation of the active phase in both F[xxxx]Sy-AP and F[xxxx]Sy-IW catalysts can be generally related to the SSL, as shown in Fig. 7A, comparing the rela- tive percentage of FeIII ions in the various surface structures.
As expected, the concentration of isolated moieties de- creases monotonically with SSL, whereas that of 3-d oxide particles rises much more steadily with an exponential-like trend (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, the featureless trend of 2-d patches matches is consistent with the fact that these are borderline structures, easily evolving into 3-d oxide clus- ters. However, the different trends of AP (solid lines) and IW (dotted lines) systems indicate that, in addition to the SSL,the preparation route is crucial for the stabilisation of the various surface structures of the FeOx/SiO2 system. Indeed,with respect to Mo [34,36] and V [35,36], FeIII ions feature a much lower chemical affinity for the silica surface, since an amount of Fe2O3 clusters comparable to that found on bare silicas (ca. 15%) was detected at much larger SSL on MoO3/SiO2 [34,36] and V2O5/SiO2 [35,36] systems. Fur- thermore, a ca. 80% concentration of oxide particles, like that found on the F[4300]S2-IW sample (ca. 0.1 Feat nm2),occurs on a 7% MoO3/SiO2 bearing a 50-fold larger SSL [34,36]. This different behaviour indicates that a weaker in- teraction of FeIII ions with silonalol groups is the driving force for the poor dispersion of the active phase in IW systems, whereas, favouring a stronger metal-support inter- action, the AP route hinders the mobility of Fe ions and formation of 3-d oxide clusters also on the highly loaded F[7300]S1-AP sample (SSL 0.14 Feat nm2).
The assumptions of deconvolution analysis then make it possible to define the dispersion, D, of the active phase as the ratio between the concentration of exposed Fe atoms in the various structures (i.e., A0 + A2 + A3 + A4) and the total number of Fe atoms reduced up to 750 C (i.e., A0 +
A1 + A2 + A3 + A4)
D = NFesurface NFetotal =
(A0 + A2 + A3 + A4)
(A0 + A1 + A2 + A3 + A4).
Dispersion of AP and IW catalysts as a function of the re- spective SSL is shown in Fig. 7B. It is evident that whereas the AP route ensures a rather good dispersion (0.850.55) of the active phase, decreasing regularly with SSL to the value of ca. 0.15 Feat nm2, the IW implies an unpredictable ex- tent of aggregation of the active phase, which is more evident for SSL exceeding the value of 0.05 Feat nm2 (Table 1) [813]. The influence of the silica carrier is then mostly linked to the specific surface area and relative SSL [3436].
4.3. Surface structures and catalytic activity
The thermodynamic driving force for consecutive ox- idation(s) of organic molecules into more stable carbon oxide(s) entails the running of selective oxidations under a kinetic regime. In terms of catalyst features, moreover, se- lective oxidations demand oxide systems bearing specific ensemble(s) of active sites with a strength of the metal oxygen bond timely tuned on the reactivity of the substrate [2,6,7,16,53,54]. In particular, isolated Fe3+ ions sup- ported on silica carriers join an enhanced functionality for

CH4 activation with a remarkable selectivity for oxygenated products [612], resulting in a MPO performance superior to that of any other system [6,12,13]. Ab initio quantum- chemical calculations suggest that this outstanding catalytic behaviour arises from an intrinsic efficiency of the FeO+ complex in activating the CH4 molecule, driving its pri- mary oxy-functionalisation to CH3OH [17,18], whereas 3-d Fe2O3 structures depress the catalytic functionality of the ti- tle system because of a poor dispersion and the enhanced reducibility of the surface Fe3+ centres [711,46,52]. On the whole these findings match with the site isolation re- quirement, well known in the field of selective oxidation reactions [1,12,16,5356], postulating that a desired reaction path proceeds over an ensemble of active sites containing the minimum number of centres for substrate activation and functionalisation [1,2,12,5356], whereas a high availability and mobility of nucleophylic lattice O= species, typical of bulk oxide clusters [6,8,53,54], is detrimental for interme- diate product lifetime. Although BR and CF catalytic data (Tables 3 and 4) confirm the superior functionality of AP catalysts arising from a higher dispersion of the active phase on silica carriers (Fig. 7B), previous kinetic-mechanistic findings indicated a second-order dependence of CH4 ac- tivation rate on the concentration of active sites [21]. The plot of FeCH4 values vs. D of the various catalysts, shown in Fig. 8, really provides a satisfactory experimental sup- port for that theoretical relationship, confirming the superior dependence of substrate activation on site concentration [2,16,1921]. Moreover, the product selectivity is even more sensitive to the degree of aggregation of the active phase,since the different reducibilities of the various surface struc- tures determine the type and concentration of oxygen species (O2, O22, O, etc.) featuring an electrophilic or nucle- ophilic character and, then, a different reactivity towards CH4 and/or intermediates (CH3OH/HCHO) [1,12,16,53,54].
Thus an easy reducibility would permit the prevailing for- mation of O2ions at the surface of oxide nanoparticles,prompting the conversion of HCHO into COx by a nucle- ophilic attack on the C atom, whereas the poor electron availability of dispersed species leads mostly to the for- mation of electrophilic oxygen species that are more active towards the unpolarised CH bond of the methane molecule.
This indicates that an effective MPO functionality is enabled by dispersion values higher than 0.5 (Fig. 8).
Deeper insight into the reactivity of various surface species can be achieved from TPR data for CH4-pretreated catalysts (Fig. 5A). Notably, despite the relevant changes with respect to those of the calcined systems, these reduc- tion patterns result still from the linear combination of the (same) five Gaussian components used for the deconvolution of the TPR spectra of the fresh systems (Fig. 6), according to the fitting parameter values listed in Table 5. The relative intensities of the various components in fresh and CH4- pretreated systems, shown in Fig. 9A, points to a marked decrease in the peak 1 and, to a lower extent, in peaks 2 and 3, previously assigned to the reduction of 3-d Fe2O3 clusters (peak 1), 2-d FeOx polymeric patches (peak 2),and low-coordination isolated species (peak 3), respec- tively. Despite the considerable (>70%) reduction of 3-d Fe2O3 species, the decrease in the component (peak 0) rel- ative to Fe3+ ions at the surface of oxide particles is less pronounced (2040%), whereas the intensity of the peak 4 related to the reduction of strongly-interacting isolated species is almost unchanged. A marked decrease in the peak area relative to oxide clusters (peak 1) and, to a lesser ex- tent, in 2-d FeOx patches (peak 2) and low-coordinated 378

Fe3+ ions (peak 3) is diagnostic of an increasing strength of the FeO bond, rendering oxygen atoms kinetically less available for methane (over)oxidation. The lowest re- ducibility of high-coordinated Fe3+ ions (peak 4) hinders any interaction with the substrate at 650 C. Therefore, tak- ing into account that the reactivity towards CH4 parallels the reducibility of the various surface structures, a decrease of the 0th component comparable to or even stronger than that of oxide particles (peak 1) should be expected. A plau- sible explanation for the slight changes in the intensity of this component (Fig. 9A) lies in a high diffusion rate of O2 ions across the lattice of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, stabilising mostly Fe3+ ions at the surface. This, in addition to account- ing for the low activity and selectivity of poorly dispersed systems (Tables 2 and 3), also explains the oxygen-release phenomenon observed on FeOx/SiO2 catalysts characterised by high concentrations of 3-d oxide species during RTOC measurements [8,10]. Overall, these findings suggest that 2-d FeOx patches, featuring an intermediate strength of the oxygen bond and a limited availability of oxygen ions, en- sure the best MPO activityselectivity pattern. In fact, the slight shift of 1 and 2% conversion levels recorded on the F[1000]S1-AP sample under oxygen-lean conditions (Ta- ble 4) signals an easier occurrence of the redox reaction cycle on such a system featuring a catalytic pattern dom- inated by 2-d FeOx patches. The variable extent of the energetic barrier further supports this evidence, as Eapp is the highest (142 kJ/mol) on the silica, which contains only 200 ppm Fe, mostly as isolated ions, and the lowest (80 85 kJ/mol) on the AP FeOx/SiO2 catalysts, which feature a catalytic pattern dominated by higher concentrations of 2-d FeOx patches. The higher degree of nuclearity of such species, likely enabling a more effective transfer of elec-

In con- trast, and inconsistent with the overwhelming concentration of easily reducible oxide (nano)particles, the intermediate Eapp value (101 kJ/mol) of the F[4300]S2-IW sample likely stems from the intrinsic difficulty generating electrophilic oxygen species from easily reducible Fe2O3 aggregates (re- quired by CH4 activation [12,16,53,54]), owing to a high electron availability in the crystal lattice [612]. The fact that in the pretreated sample the relative concentration of oxi- dised Fe3+ ions at the surface of oxide species is much larger than in the bulk strengthens the above hypothesis. Therefore,such findings prove that different electronic features of the FeO bond parallel the structure of the various surface FeOx species, prompting, as a consequence, different oxygen ac- tivation paths according to the scheme drawn in Fig. 10.
Deconvolution analysis of TPR spectra for the used cata- lysts (Fig. 5B) indicates that the changes in the TPR pattern of the used F[3700]S1-AP sample stem mostly from the quantitative transformation of 2-d FeOx patches (peak 2) and, to a small extent, of isolated moieties (peaks 3 and 4) into 3-d Fe2O3 clusters (peak 1), as shown in Fig. 9B. On the other hand, the changes in the structure of the F[4300]S2-IW sample, which is characterised by an overwhelming concen- tration (>85%) of aggregated 3-d oxide particles, appear to be negligible. This result is a direct consequence of the surface-assisted redox reaction cycle, involving a cyclic se- quence of rupture and formation of metaloxygen bonds as a result of the alternate activation of substrate and oxy-

As for the rupture of FeOSi(Fe) bridged bonds, the redox cycle prompts the mobility of Fe3+ ions and the consequent sintering, which affects the stability of AP systems (Fig. 4) in a way analo- gous to the effect on the stability of well-dispersed Fe-ZSM5 systems in the SCR of NOx, causing the extraction of Fe3+ ions from the zeolite framework [25,57].
5. Conclusions
The adsorption/precipitation method is much more effec- tive than incipient wetness in promoting the dispersion of iron across silica carriers.
The speciation of the active phase determines the reduc- tion pattern of the FeOx/SiO2 system.
Isolated species, 2-d (FeOx)n patches and 3-d Fe2O3 clusters, coexist on the surface of silica carriers and FeOx/ SiO2 catalysts; their relative abundance depends on the preparation method and surface loading.
The adsorption/precipitation method strongly enhances the MPO performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts by improving the dispersion of the active phase.
The redox reaction cycle yields sintering phenomena of the active phase, causing a progressive deactivation of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts.
