1. The adsorption/precipitation method is significantly more effective than the incipient wetness technique in dispersing iron across silica carriers. 

2. Various iron species including isolated Fe3+, 2-dimensional (FeOx)n patches, and 3-dimensional Fe2O3 clusters coexist on silica surfaces and in FeOx/SiO2 catalysts. Their relative presence varies based on the preparation process and surface loading of iron.

3. The adsorption/precipitation method notably boosts the performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts in the selective oxidation of methane to formaldehyde by enhancing the dispersion of the active phase.

4. The redox reaction cycle results in sintering of the active phase, leading to a progressive deactivation of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts over time.

1. 吸附沉淀法在促进铁在硅酸盐载体上的分散方面比湿浸渍法更有效。

2. 铁物种，包括孤立的Fe3+、二维（FeOx）n片和三维Fe2O3簇，在硅酸盐表面和FeOx/SiO2催化剂上共存。它们的存在比例取决于制备方法和铁层负载。

3. 吸附沉淀法显著提高了FeOx/SiO2催化剂在甲烷选择性氧化为甲醛过程中的性能，通过改进活性相的分散。

4. 红外反应循环导致活性相的烧结现象，导致FeOx/SiO2催化剂的逐渐失活。
