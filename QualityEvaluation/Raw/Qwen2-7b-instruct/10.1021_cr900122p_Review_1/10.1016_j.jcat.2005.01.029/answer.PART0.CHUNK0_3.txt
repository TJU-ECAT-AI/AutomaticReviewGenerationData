1. The adsorption/precipitation technique is superior to the incipient wetness method in distributing iron across silica carriers, enhancing catalyst performance.

2. Various surface structures, including isolated Fe species, 2-dimensional (FeOx)n patches, and 3-dimensional Fe2O3 clusters, coexist on silica and FeOx/SiO2 catalyst surfaces. Their proportions vary depending on the preparation method and surface loading.

3. The adsorption/precipitation method significantly boosts the performance of iron oxides on silica catalysts by improving the dispersion of the active phase.

4. The redox reaction cycle results in sintering of the active phase, leading to a progressive loss of activity in FeOx/SiO2 catalysts.

1. 吸附/沉淀方法在促进铁在硅载体上的分散方面比湿浸渍法更有效，提高了催化剂性能。

2. 在硅载体和FeOx/SiO2催化剂表面，孤立物种、二维（FeOx）n斑块和三维Fe2O3簇共存。它们的比例取决于制备方法和表面负载。

3. 吸附/沉淀方法显著提高了铁氧化物在硅基催化剂中的性能，通过改善活性相的分散。

4. 红外反应循环导致活性相的结块现象，导致FeOx/SiO2催化剂活性的逐渐丧失。
