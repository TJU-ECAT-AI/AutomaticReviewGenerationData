1. The adsorption/precipitation method is more effective than the incipient wetness method in spreading iron evenly across silica carriers.
2. Various types of iron species like isolated species, 2-dimensional (FeOx)n patches, and 3-dimensional Fe2O3 clusters coexist on the surface of silica and iron oxide/silica catalysts, and their proportions vary depending on the preparation method and surface loading.
3. The adsorption/precipitation method significantly improves the performance of iron oxide/silica catalysts in selective oxidation of methane to formaldehyde by enhancing the dispersion of the active phase.
4. The redox reaction cycle leads to the sintering of the active phase, causing a gradual deactivation of iron oxide/silica catalysts.

1. 吸附沉淀法在促进铁均匀分布到硅酸盐载体上比浸渍湿法更有效。
2. 铁物种，如孤立物种、二维（FeOx）n斑块和三维Fe2O3簇，在二氧化硅和铁氧化物/二氧化硅催化剂的表面共存，它们的比例取决于制备方法和表面积负载。
3. 吸附沉淀法显著提高了甲烷选择性氧化为甲醛的铁氧化物/二氧化硅催化剂的性能，通过改善活性相的分散性。
4. 红外反应循环导致活性相的结块，引起铁氧化物/二氧化硅催化剂的逐渐失效。
