[1] "The adsorption/precipitation method is much more effective than incipient wetness in promoting the dispersion of iron across silica carriers."
[2] "The speciation of the active phase determines the reduction pattern of the FeOx/SiO2 system."
[3] "Isolated species, 2-d (FeOx)n patches and 3-d Fe2O3 clusters, coexist on the surface of silica carriers and FeOx/SiO2 catalysts; their relative abundance depends on the preparation method and surface loading."
[4] "The adsorption/precipitation method strongly enhances the MPO performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts by improving the dispersion of the active phase."
[5] "The redox reaction cycle yields sintering phenomena of the active phase, causing a progressive deactivation of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts."

1. The adsorption/precipitation technique is superior to the incipient wetness method in distributing iron uniformly across silica supports. 

2. The composition of active sites on the catalyst dictates how the system gets reduced. 

3. Iron species, in the forms of isolated entities, 2-dimensional aggregates, and 3-dimensional clusters, coexist on silica surfaces and catalysts. Their proportions are influenced by preparation methodology and surface loading.

4. The adsorption/precipitation technique markedly boosts the performance of iron oxide/silica catalysts in the partial oxidation of methane by enhancing the dispersion of active sites.

5. The redox reaction sequence leads to sintering of active sites, causing a decline in the catalytic activity of iron oxide/silica catalysts over time.

1. 吸附/沉淀方法在促进铁在硅酸盐载体上的分散方面比湿法浸渍更有效。

2. 催化剂上活性位点的组成决定了系统的还原模式。 

3. 铁物种，包括孤立实体、二维聚集体和三维簇，在硅酸盐表面和催化剂上共存。它们的比例受制于制备方法和表面负载。

4. 吸附/沉淀技术显著提高了铁氧化物/硅酸盐催化剂在甲烷部分氧化中的性能，通过改善活性位点的分散。

5. 红外反应循环导致活性位点的结块现象，导致铁氧化物/硅酸盐催化剂活性的逐渐下降。
