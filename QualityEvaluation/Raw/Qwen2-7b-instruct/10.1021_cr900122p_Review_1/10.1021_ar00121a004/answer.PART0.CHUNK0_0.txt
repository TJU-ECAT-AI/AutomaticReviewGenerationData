The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion rates poses significant challenges due to the intricate nature of the reaction mechanisms involved. The literature highlights the importance of site isolation, which plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues.

Catalysts like transition metal surfaces and oxides are essential for ODH processes. The structural details of these surfaces significantly impact the reaction outcomes. For instance, the ammonia synthesis reaction demands atomically rough surfaces with high-coordination hollow sites for efficient N2 dissociation. This contrasts with the more straightforward, homogeneous catalysis using single transition-metal atom molecules.

The hydrogenation of ethylene over platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh) catalysts exemplifies another facet of ODH. These catalysts operate through an irreducible carbonaceous overlayer, primarily consisting of adsorbed ethylidyne. This layer acts as a conduit for hydrogen transfer from H2 dissociation by the metal to ethylene, which is weakly adsorbed onto the ethylidyne layer. This mechanism is indicative of the potential for ODH over homogeneous catalysts.

Coadsorbates, such as potassium (K), can modify the catalytic properties by blocking high-symmetry sites, creating new sites, or inducing charge transfer that alters the bonding of reaction intermediates. These modifications lead to adjustments in reaction rates and product distributions, impacting the overall efficiency of ODH processes.

The collective influence of these factors on ODH efficiency is profound. Site isolation, for instance, ensures that alkyl groups are not excessively deactivated, allowing for selective dehydrogenation. The choice of catalyst, its surface properties, and the role of coadsorbates are integral to achieving high selectivity and conversion rates in ODH.

Addressing selectivity issues often involves optimizing the catalyst surface, tuning the reaction conditions, and employing specific coadsorbates. Future work in this area will likely explore non-metallic catalysts, catalyst deactivation and regeneration strategies, and other surface-related aspects to further enhance ODH efficiency.

氧化脱氢反应（ODH）涉及到复杂催化剂之间的相互作用，包括多孔金属氧化物和负载系统。实现高选择性和转化率面临着重大挑战，这主要是由于反应机制的复杂性。文献强调了隔离位点的重要性，它在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。

例如，过渡金属表面和氧化物对于ODH过程至关重要。这些表面的结构细节对反应结果产生显著影响。氨合成反应需要原子级粗糙且具有高配位空穴的表面，以实现有效N2分解。这与在同质催化中更常见的单个过渡金属原子分子形成鲜明对比。

铂（Pt）和铑（Rh）催化剂上乙烯的氢化是ODH的另一个例子。这些催化剂通过不可逆的碳质层运行，该层主要由吸附的乙炔组成。这个层充当氢转移的媒介，氢源自金属的H2分解到弱吸附在乙炔层上的乙烯。这一机制表明ODH可能在同质催化剂上发生。

共吸附剂如钾（K）可以通过阻塞高对称位点、创建新位点或诱导电荷转移来修改催化性能，从而改变反应中间体的结合方式。这些修改导致反应速率和产品分布的调整，影响ODH过程的整体效率。

所有这些因素对ODH效率的影响是深远的。位点隔离确保烷基团不过度失活，允许选择性脱氢。催化剂的选择、其表面特性和共吸附剂的作用对于实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。

解决选择性问题通常涉及优化催化剂表面、调整反应条件和使用特定共吸附剂。未来的研究将在这一领域探索非金属催化剂、催化剂失活和再生策略以及其他表面相关方面，以进一步提高ODH效率。
