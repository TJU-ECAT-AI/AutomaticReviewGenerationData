[1] "The combined use of UHV surface analytical tools and the ability to perform catalytic reactions over single-crystal surfaces under conditions that truly approach those of industrial processes have revealed detailed characteristics of these systems hitherto unobtainable."
[2] "Catalysis of the ammonia synthesis reaction is clearly dependent upon the structural details of the metal surface."
[3] "Reactions of this type cannot occur on single transition-metal atom molecules that are utilized most frequently in homogeneous catalysis."
[4] "The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene by Pt and Rh has been shown to occur over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne."
[5] "It has been suggested that this overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, from H2 dissociation by the metal, is transferred to ethylene, weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer."
[6] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."
[7] "The examples that were presented include the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene over molybdenum (coad Sorbed sulfur), the conversion of n-hexane over platinum (coadsorbed gold), and the hydrogenation of CO (coadsorbed potassium)."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves several factors including the choice of catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and proposed reaction mechanisms. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability to activate C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing unwanted side reactions and promoting desired pathways. For instance, the use of bulk metal oxides and supported systems allows for better control over the reaction conditions and catalyst activity. Challenges in achieving high selectivity often arise due to the competing pathways for hydrogen abstraction and decarbonylation. However, advancements in catalyst design, such as the incorporation of coadsorbates that block sites of high symmetry or create new sites, can significantly improve the selectivity and conversion rates. Additionally, understanding the electronic effects, like those induced by potassium in the hydrogenation of CO, can lead to more efficient and selective catalysts. Overall, the interplay between catalyst choice, reaction mechanisms, and process optimization is essential for enhancing the efficiency of the ODH process.

氧化脱氢化烷烃（ODH）的分析涉及几个因素，包括催化剂的选择、实现高选择性和转化的挑战以及反应机制的提议。过程效率受C-H键激活、M-烷基中间体形成和2H-摘取的影响。隔离站点在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过防止不希望的副反应并促进所需路径来提高选择性和转化率。例如，使用固体金属氧化物和支持系统可以更好地控制反应条件和催化剂活性。实现高选择性的挑战通常由于氢摘除和脱羰基的竞争途径而产生。然而，催化剂设计的改进，如通过引入阻塞高对称性站点或创建新站点的共吸附剂，可以显著提高选择性和转化率。此外，了解电子效应，如钾在CO氢化过程中诱导的效应，可以导致更有效和选择性的催化剂。总体而言，催化剂选择、反应机制和过程优化之间的相互作用对于增强ODH过程的效率至关重要。
