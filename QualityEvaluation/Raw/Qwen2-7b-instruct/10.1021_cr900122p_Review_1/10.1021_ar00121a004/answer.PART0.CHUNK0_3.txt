[1] "Catalysis of the ammonia synthesis reaction is clearly dependent upon the structural details of the metal surface. The need for atomically rough surfaces containing high-coordination hollowing sites where N2 can dissociate has been revealed."
[2] "Catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene by Pt and Rh has been shown to occur over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne."
[3] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."
[4] "Ultimately, the knowledge obtained will allow us not only to understand but also to predict catalyst performance and design catalysts for new processes."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between catalysts, aiming to achieve high selectivity and conversion rates. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are commonly used catalysts. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the intricate mechanisms involved, such as the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The role of site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for precise control over the reaction pathways, leading to efficient and selective production of desired products. This knowledge enables not only a deeper understanding of the catalytic process but also the prediction and optimization of catalyst performance for various applications.
