[1] "The combined use of UHV surface analytical tools and the ability to perform catalytic reactions over single-crystal surfaces under conditions that truly approach those of industrial processes have revealed detailed characteristics of these systems hitherto unobtainable."
[2] "Catalysis of the ammonia synthesis reaction is clearly dependent upon the structural details of the metal surface."
[3] "Reactions of this type cannot occur on single transition-metal atom molecules that are utilized most frequently in homogeneous catalysis."
[4] "The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene by Pt and Rh has been shown to occur over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne."
[5] "It has been suggested that this overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, from H2 dissociation by the metal, is transferred to ethylene, weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer."
[6] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."

1. The utilization of advanced surface analytical techniques and the execution of catalytic reactions on single-crystal surfaces under realistic industrial conditions have unveiled intricate details of catalyst functionalities that were previously inaccessible. These methodologies have provided profound insights into the operational mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysts.

2. The ammonia synthesis reaction demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity to the microscopic surface characteristics of the metal catalyst, emphasizing the pivotal role of surface topology in catalysis.

3. Processes akin to ammonia synthesis cannot be replicated using isolated transition metal atoms typically employed in homogeneous catalysis, underscoring the significance of surface-bound structures in catalytic activity.

4. The hydrogenation of ethylene by platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh) unfolds on an inherently carbonaceous surface overlay predominantly constituted by adsorbed ethylidyne groups.

5. This ethylidyne layer acts as a conduit, facilitating the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the metal surface to weakly adsorbed ethylene molecules, thereby driving the hydrogenation reaction forward.

6. The incorporation of coadsorbates influences the rates and selectivities of catalytic transformations by obstructing high-symmetry sites, generating novel active sites, or mediating electron transfers that modulate the bonding states of reactive intermediates.

1. 高真空表面分析工具与单晶表面在工业条件下进行催化反应的结合，揭示了这些系统的详细特性，这是以前无法获得的。这些方法提供了对异质催化剂功能的深刻见解。

2. 氨合成反应清楚地依赖于金属催化剂表面结构的细节，强调了表面拓扑在催化中的关键作用。

3. 类似氨合成的过程不能通过使用在均相催化中常用的孤立过渡金属原子来复制，这突出了表面绑定结构在催化活性中的重要性。

4. 铂（Pt）和铑（Rh）催化的乙烷氢化发生在由吸附的乙基炔组成的固态覆盖层上，该覆盖层是不可还原的、碳基的表面层。

5. 这个乙基炔层充当一个通道，使氢原子从金属表面转移到弱吸附的乙烷分子，从而推动氢化反应的进行。

6. 共吸附物通过阻塞高对称位点、生成新的活性位点或介导电子转移改变反应中间体的键合状态，影响催化转化的速率和选择性。
