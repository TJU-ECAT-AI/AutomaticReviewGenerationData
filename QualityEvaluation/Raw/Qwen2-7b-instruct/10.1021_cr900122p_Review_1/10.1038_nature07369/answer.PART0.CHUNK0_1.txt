[1] "The backbone of many organic compounds is composed of CC bonds, but the function of these molecules is often derived from the presence of heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, which are held in these molecules by Cheteroatom bonds."
[2] "Compounds with Mheteroatom bonds that undergo these types of reaction are referred to here as hetero-organometallic complexes."
[3] "To tap the potential of these compounds as intermediates in emerging catalytic processes, the principles that control their reactivity need to be understood, and these are now beginning to be delineated."
[4] "In this review, I describe carbonheteroatom bond formation catalysed by organometallic complexes and the underlying hetero-organo- metallic chemistry."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the need for precise control over the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions. Reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play crucial roles in determining the process efficiency. Site isolation techniques can help address selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific regions of the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the yield of desired products.
