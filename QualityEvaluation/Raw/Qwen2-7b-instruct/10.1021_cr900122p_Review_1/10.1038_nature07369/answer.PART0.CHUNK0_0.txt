[1] "And Mimido or Moxo complexes that undergo [2 + 2] cycloadditions with alkenes (in which the two atoms of the M=O or M=N π-bond combine to make a saturated four-membered ring) were not known until the past decade33."
[2] "Reductive elimination to form CN, CO and CS bonds in amines, ethers and sulphides20,21 holds promise for reducing the reliance on existing functional groups."
[3] "Recent progress clearly indicates that the latter was true."
[4] "Many researchers are beginning to develop synthetically valuable processes relying on hetero-organometallic intermediates."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature indicates that the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are significant due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms. For instance, C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction play crucial roles. The efficiency of the process is influenced by these factors collectively. Site isolation techniques are employed to address selectivity issues by controlling the reaction environment and preventing unwanted side reactions. This approach enhances the yield and purity of the desired products, making the ODH process more efficient and selective.
