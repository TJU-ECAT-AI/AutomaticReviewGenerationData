[1] "In addition, the principles of metalligand bonding are used as a framework to explain the differences in reactivity between organometallic intermediates and hetero-organometallic intermediates."
[2] "Reductive elimination to form CN, CO and CS bonds in amines, ethers and sulphides (Fig. 4a) are widely used for the synthesis of pharmaceutical candidates, fine chemicals, polymers, components of organic devices and even ligands for other catalysts."
[3] "Although amido and alkoxo ligands have now been shown to participate in the type of reductive elimination reactions that alkyl ligands undergo, the electronic properties of amido and alkoxo ligands cause the rates and scope of these reactions to differ in synthetically important ways."
[4] "Reductive eliminations of alkyl aryl ethers, alkyl acetates and N-alkyl sulphonamides from platinum(iv) that are part of the mechanism of alkane functionalizations (discussed in the next section) occur by a non-concerted mechanism, and these reactions occur faster from complexes containing ligands that can better support anionic charge at the heteroatom than from those whose ligands are less able to support such charge."
[5] "The conversion of typically unreactive CH bonds to C=C and CX bonds (where X is O, N, B or Si) holds promise for reducing the reliance on existing functional groups."

Analyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include understanding the reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific sites on the catalyst surface. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. Achieving high selectivity requires careful control over the reaction conditions and the catalyst properties to ensure that only desired products are formed.

转化通常不反应的CH键为C=C和CX键（X为O、N、B或Si）有望减少对现有功能基团的依赖。氧化脱氢化烷烃的过程需要考虑各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统。在实现高选择性和转化率时面临的挑战包括理解反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽象。通过隔离特定位点来解决选择性问题对于形成所需产物至关重要。该过程的效率受催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性的影响。为了实现高选择性，需要仔细控制反应条件和催化剂性质，以确保仅形成所需的产物。
