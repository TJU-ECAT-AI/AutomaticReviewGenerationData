The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves several challenges, primarily the development of catalysts that are both highly active and selective. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the formation of unwanted byproducts. Mechanistically, C-H bond activation is essential for ODH reactions, and metal-alkyl intermediates are involved. Typically, two hydrogen abstraction steps are needed for complete dehydrogenation. Site isolation techniques can enhance selectivity by confining reactive species to specific locations on the catalyst surface. To address these issues, highly dispersed metal oxides and supported systems are often utilized.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及几个挑战，主要是开发既能高效又能选择性地催化反应的催化剂。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括形成副产物。从机制上讲，C-H键活化对于ODH反应至关重要，并且金属-烷基中间体参与其中。通常需要两个氢解离步骤才能完成脱氢。位点隔离技术可以通过将活性物种限制在催化剂表面的特定位置来提高选择性。为了应对这些问题，通常使用高度分散的金属氧化物和支持系统。
