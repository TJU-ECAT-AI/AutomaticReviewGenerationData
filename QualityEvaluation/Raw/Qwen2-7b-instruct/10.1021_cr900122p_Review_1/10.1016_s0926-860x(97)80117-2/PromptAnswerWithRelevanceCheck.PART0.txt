Chapter 2.2 deals with hydrogenation centred on the attractive enantioselective induction by organometallic compounds.
Chapter 2.3 focuses on the application of catalysis by organomstallics to polymerizations (homo-, oligo-, co-polymerization, metathesis, telomeri- zation).
The importance of these processes is emphasised, e.g. cyclooligomerizations and the relatively recent development of carbon monoxide copolymerizations.
Volume 2 begins (Chapter 3.1) with recent views about methods of organometallic chemistry (immobilization of catalyst, molecular modelling, new analytical methods in detect- ing intermediates, development of multifunctional catalysts).
Chapter 3.2 introduces new processes based on biotransformations (however, some doubt is justified about the relev- ance within the context of the subject of this handbook despite its great interest), use of host-guest chemistry and membrane reactors, phase transfer catalysis, electrocatalysis, etc.).
Chapter 3.3 details peculiar aspects (some are remarkably presented) of organometallic catalysis applied to asymmetric dihydroxylations, hydrovinylations, Pauson-Khand reactions, to carbon dioxide chemistry, C-H activation of alkanes, homogeneous catalysis in living cells.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the conversion of alkanes into olefins through the breaking of C-H bonds. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in this process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, involving multiple pathways such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is a critical factor in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the reaction environment and substrate access to the active sites.

The role of catalysts in ODH is multifaceted. Bulk metal oxides can offer high activity but may lack the selectivity needed for commercial applications, whereas supported systems can provide better control over the reaction pathway and product selectivity. Supported catalysts, especially those incorporating noble metals like platinum or palladium, are often favored due to their high activity and selectivity for olefin formation.

The reaction mechanism typically involves the activation of the C-H bond by the catalyst, followed by a series of steps that can lead to olefin formation through either 2H-abstraction or other pathways. The selectivity towards olefin products depends on the catalyst's structure, composition, and the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of co-catalysts.

Site isolation, achieved through the design of the catalyst support or by modifying the catalyst's surface properties, helps in directing the reaction towards the desired olefin products. This is done by creating barriers or preferential environments for the formation of olefins, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

In summary, the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the reaction environment and substrate access to the active sites, ultimately contributing to the optimization of the ODH process for practical applications.

氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）涉及通过断裂C-H键将烷烃转化为烯烃。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，在此过程中发挥关键作用。由于反应的复杂性，实现高选择性和转化率往往面临挑战。涉及的路径包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-摘除等。通过控制反应环境和底物对活性位点的访问，位点隔离是解决选择性问题的关键因素。

催化剂在ODH中的作用多种多样。块状金属氧化物可能提供高活性，但可能缺乏商业应用所需的高选择性；而支撑系统可以提供更好的路径控制和产物选择性。特别是那些包含铂或钯等贵金属的支撑催化剂，因其高活性和烯烃形成的高选择性而受到青睐。

反应机制通常涉及催化剂对C-H键的激活，随后是一系列步骤，最终通过2H-摘除或其他途径导致烯烃形成。产物的选择性取决于催化剂的结构、组成和反应条件，包括温度、压力以及共催化剂的存在。

位点隔离，通过设计催化剂支撑或修改催化剂表面性质实现，有助于将反应导向所需的烯烃产物。这通过创建障碍或偏好环境来促进烯烃的形成，从而提高ODH过程的整体效率。

总之，各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、以及提出的反应机制共同影响过程效率。通过控制反应环境和底物对活性位点的访问，位点隔离在优化ODH过程以满足实际应用需求方面起着重要作用。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in ODH often involve finding the right catalyst that can efficiently activate C-H bonds without unwanted side reactions. Mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction are key in the process. Site isolation techniques can address selectivity issues by confining reactive sites, thus enhancing the conversion and selectivity of the desired products. The efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by the catalyst's ability to control these mechanisms effectively.

The role of catalysts in addressing environmental concerns is highlighted, with a focus on reducing industry waste and abating pollutants. This is achieved through the development of catalysts that can transform harmful substances into less toxic or non-toxic compounds. For instance, catalysts that utilize hydrogen peroxide in oxidation processes have gained attention due to their potential in producing oxygenates in a controlled manner.

Chiral drug synthesis presents another promising area for organometallic catalysis. Catalysts capable of controlling the stereochemistry during the synthesis of chiral molecules are essential for the production of enantiomerically pure drugs, which are crucial in pharmaceutical applications.

Efficient recovery of chlorine from hydrogen chloride is a critical process in industries involving chlorinated compounds. Advanced catalysts, such as the newly developed active chromia catalyst, are being employed to achieve high purity in the recovery of chlorine, thereby addressing environmental and economic concerns.

Research on cation exchange in high silica zeolites is vital for understanding the complex interactions between cations and zeolite matrices. The rules governing cation exchange can provide insights into the design of catalysts with tailored properties for specific applications, including deNOx processes and fine chemical synthesis.

Advancements in molecular understanding of catalyst structure and function, as discussed in "Understanding Catalysis at the Molecular Level: Challenges and Perspectives," have contributed significantly to the development of more efficient and selective catalytic processes. This knowledge helps in designing catalysts with optimized structure-property relationships, improving their performance in various industrial applications.
