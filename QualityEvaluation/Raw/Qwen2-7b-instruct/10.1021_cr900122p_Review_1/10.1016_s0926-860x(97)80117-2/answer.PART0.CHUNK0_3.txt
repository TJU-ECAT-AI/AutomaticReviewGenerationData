1. Catalysis plays a crucial role in providing essential societal needs such as healthcare, food supply, energy, and materials. As economies grow worldwide, the primary objectives of catalysis now include reducing industrial waste and mitigating pollutants.

2. Specific examples of catalytic processes include:
   - Catalytic combustion on Pd-PdO, which prevents the formation of NOx.
   - Selective oxidations, especially of low paraffins such as methane.
   - Incorporating redox sites (e.g., Ti) in silicate molecular sieves for hydrocarbon oxidations using hydrogen peroxide, which replaces homogeneous oxidations and generates a wide variety of oxygenates, with selectivity influenced by the pore size of the molecular sieve matrix.
   - Replacing hazardous strong liquid acids in alkylate and isomerization processes of paraffins in gasoline pools.

1. 催化剂在提供社会的基本需求，如医疗保健、食物供应、能源和材料方面发挥着关键作用。随着全球经济的增长，催化技术的主要目标现在包括减少工业废物和减少污染物排放。

2. 具体的催化过程包括：
   - 使用Pd-PdO进行催化燃烧，以防止形成NOx。
   - 对低烷烃（如甲烷）进行选择性氧化。
   - 在硅酸盐分子筛中引入红氧化合物（例如Ti），使用过氧化氢对碳氢化合物进行氧化，这取代了均相氧化并产生了广泛的氧化物，其选择性由分子筛矩阵的孔径大小控制。
   - 用强液态酸替代在汽油池中的异构化和烷基化过程。
