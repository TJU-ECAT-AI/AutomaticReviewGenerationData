[1] "Some of the most promising aspects of organometaUic catalysis presented in the aforementioned chapters are developed in the conclusion and important points addressed for the future."
[2] "The increasing production of organic compounds via chlori- nated compounds steadily increases the production of hydrogen chloride. Therefore, a proper process for recovery of chlorine from HCI is necessary."
[3] "In addition, the mobility of cations in high silica zeolites, the formation and function of small 'precipitated' oxidic species in molecular sieves and their redox function are discussed, and the question is raised if there exists an interaction between the single cations and oxidic species."

The interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). Achieving high selectivity and conversion presents significant challenges due to the complex nature of the reactions, which involve C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is essential in addressing selectivity issues, ensuring that the reactions proceed efficiently without unwanted side reactions. The role of catalyst structure and the ability to control the reaction environment are critical factors influencing the process efficiency. Understanding the local environment of metal centers and the dynamics of cations in high silica matrices can lead to the development of more effective catalysts. The document highlights the importance of research in these areas for advancing the ODH process and improving its environmental and economic viability.
