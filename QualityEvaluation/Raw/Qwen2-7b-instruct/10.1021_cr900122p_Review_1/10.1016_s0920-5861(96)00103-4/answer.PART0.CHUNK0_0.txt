[1] "Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice oxygen ions. Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring."
[2] "Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."
[3] "In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established. For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates."
[4] "Ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts."
[5] "For supported oxide catalysts, the idea is here to determine how a support may modify the catalytic properties of the different oxide species (as inorganic clusters of different size)."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are multifaceted, involving the ability of catalysts to efficiently activate C-H bonds, create M-alkyl intermediates, and undergo 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as the nature and size of the active sites, the reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides, and the structure sensitivity of the reactions to both the solid surface and reactant molecules. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that different reaction pathways are followed, enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic process.
