[1] "Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice oxygen ions. Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring."
[2] "Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."
[3] "In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established. For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates."
[4] "Ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts."
[5] "For supported oxide catalysts, the idea is here to determine how a support may modify the catalytic properties of the different oxide species (as inorganic clusters of different size)."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are multifaceted, involving the ability of catalysts to efficiently activate C-H bonds, create M-alkyl intermediates, and undergo 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as the nature and size of the active sites, the reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides, and the structure sensitivity of the reactions to both the solid surface and reactant molecules. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that different reaction pathways are followed, enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic process.

[1] "For instance n-butane oxidation reaction to maleic anhydride necessitates 7 lattice oxide ions, 8 hydrogen atoms abstraction from the substrate, 3 oxygen atoms insertion and 14 electrons transfer!"
[2] "Such a catalyst is well known for the oxidation of n-butane into maleic anhydride."
[3] "The role of dioxygen is to regenerate or maintain the oxidized state of the catalyst."
[4] "In a study of iron hydroxyphosphates exhibiting clusters of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra of different sizes has been carried out."
[5] "Depending upon their composition these phases contain clusters of different sizes ranging from dimers (Fe4(POa)3(OH) 3 to continuous chains (Fe2(PO4)O)."
[6] "All samples were active and selective for the reaction even for the different sizes of the clusters but the optimum activity and selectivity were observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2 called barbosalite and containing limited size clusters, namely trimers as schematized in Fig. 4a."
[7] "Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds."
[8] "The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, is crucial for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process include the need for efficient activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues, as the size and structure of active sites can significantly affect the reaction outcomes. For example, in the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, it requires a series of steps involving the abstraction of 8 hydrogen atoms, insertion of 3 oxygen atoms, and 14 electron transfers. Iron hydroxyphosphate catalysts, which contain clusters of FeO 6 octahedra of different sizes, are found to be active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid. The optimum activity and selectivity are observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2, which contains trimers of FeO 6 octahedra. Other inorganic compounds with similar structures also exhibit catalytic activity. The presence of calcium cations, silicate anions, and the size of the FeO 6 octahedra clusters can affect the catalytic performance. To improve the efficiency of supported oxide catalysts, methods such as impregnation with a molybdate solution at controlled pH levels are employed. These factors collectively demonstrate the complexity and interdependence of various parameters in optimizing the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe that the reactions typically follow the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen ions. These ions exhibit distinct catalytic properties, acting either electrophilically or nucleophilically. Electrophilic oxygen interacts with double bonds or aromatic rings, whereas nucleophilic oxygen engages with C-H bonds adjacent to these functional groups.

The active sites in oxidation reactions are considered molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms. Their size significantly impacts the catalytic properties. For instance, double trimers of FeO6 octahedra are highly effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates. Similarly, ensembles of four VO6 octahedra are proposed as active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.

The size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is crucial and varies depending on the specific reaction and the support material used. Parameters like the reducibility and reoxidability of the oxides also play significant roles in the catalytic performance of the materials.

To address selectivity issues in ODH, site isolation becomes a critical factor. By controlling the size and structure of the active sites, catalysts can achieve high selectivity and conversion rates. The dynamic view of oxidation catalysts under reaction conditions is fundamental for understanding their operational efficiency.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）分析中，我们发现反应通常遵循马尔斯和范克里夫恩机制，涉及晶格氧离子。这些离子显示出电磷酸或核磷酸特性，并因此表现出不同的催化性质，因为电磷酸氧与双键或芳香环相互作用，而核磷酸氧则与双键或芳香环附近的C-H键相互作用。

氧化反应的活性位点被认为是金属氧化物原子的分子“无机簇”。它们的大小显著影响催化性能。例如，铁羟基磷酸盐上的双FeO6八面体三聚体特别适合异丁酸氧化为甲基丙烯酸。同样，四聚体VO6八面体簇被提议作为范德瓦尔斯磷酸盐催化剂中的活性位点，用于丁烷氧化为马来酸酐。

这些“无机分子簇”的大小作为活性位点是重要的，并且根据考虑的特定反应和支持材料的不同而变化。氧化物的可还原性和再氧化性参数对催化反应性能具有重要作用。

为了解决ODH的选择性问题，位点隔离变得至关重要。通过控制活性位点的大小和结构，催化剂可以实现高选择性和转化率。在反应条件下考虑氧化催化剂的动态视图对于理解其操作效率是基本的。

1. Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis typically follow the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen ions. These ions can exhibit either electrophilic or nucleophilic behavior, influencing their catalytic properties based on whether they interact with a double bond, aromatic ring, or C-H bond in the vicinity of these functional groups.

2. The size of the deposited oxide species significantly impacts catalytic properties. Smaller, monomeric species tend to exhibit acidic characteristics, while larger, polymeric species often offer better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than bulk-type oxides.

3. For instance, double trimers of FeO6 octahedra are notably active and selective for isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates. Similarly, ensembles of four VO6 octahedra are proposed to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.

4. It is evident that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' serving as active sites plays a crucial role in the efficiency of the process, varying depending on the reaction type and the support used.

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes requires multiple steps, including oxygen ion replenishment, hydrogen atom extraction, and electron transfer, involving various catalysts. Different catalysts, whether bulk metal oxides or supported systems, play crucial roles in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges in achieving high selectivity include the need for efficient C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction.

2. The selectivity of the process is influenced by the interplay between catalyst structure, reactivity, and the specific conditions under which the reaction takes place. Factors such as the size of active sites, the coordination environment around metal centers, and the mobility of lattice oxygen ions contribute significantly to process efficiency.

3. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues. The arrangement and size of clusters of metal oxide atoms, such as double trimers or ensembles of four dimers, affect the reaction pathways and product distribution. By controlling the size and structure of these active sites, catalysts can be optimized for specific ODH reactions, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates.

4. Catalysts are considered dynamically under reaction conditions, reflecting the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and the mobility of lattice oxygen ions. Achieving a steady state requires a certain period on stream, and for some catalysts, this might extend to hundreds of hours before reaching optimal performance. The optimization of catalyst parameters, such as the VS+/V4+ ion ratio in supported systems, can help in maintaining high selectivity and conversion rates over extended periods.

2. 这个过程的选择性受到催化剂结构、活性和反应条件之间相互作用的影响。因素如活性位点的大小、金属中心周围的配位环境以及晶格氧离子的流动性，对过程效率有着显著影响。

3. 点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。金属氧化物原子簇的排列和大小，例如双二聚体或四二聚体的集合，影响反应途径和产品分布。通过控制这些活性位点的大小和结构，催化剂可以优化特定的脱氢烷烃反应，从而提高选择性和转化率。

4. 在反应条件下考虑催化剂为动态，反映马尔斯和范克里夫恩机制以及晶格氧离子的流动性。达到稳定状态需要一定的运行时间，并且对于某些催化剂，这可能需要数百小时才能达到最佳性能。通过优化催化剂参数，如支持系统中的VS+/V4+离子比率，可以帮助维持长期的选择性和转化率。
