[6] "All samples were active and selective for the reaction even for the different sizes of the clusters but the optimum activity and selectivity were observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2 called barbosalite and containing limited size clusters, namely trimers as schematized in Fig. 4a."
[7] "Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds."
[8] "The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, is crucial for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process include the need for efficient activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues, as the size and structure of active sites can significantly affect the reaction outcomes. For example, in the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, it requires a series of steps involving the abstraction of 8 hydrogen atoms, insertion of 3 oxygen atoms, and 14 electron transfers. Iron hydroxyphosphate catalysts, which contain clusters of FeO 6 octahedra of different sizes, are found to be active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid. The optimum activity and selectivity are observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2, which contains trimers of FeO 6 octahedra. Other inorganic compounds with similar structures also exhibit catalytic activity. The presence of calcium cations, silicate anions, and the size of the FeO 6 octahedra clusters can affect the catalytic performance. To improve the efficiency of supported oxide catalysts, methods such as impregnation with a molybdate solution at controlled pH levels are employed. These factors collectively demonstrate the complexity and interdependence of various parameters in optimizing the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，各种催化剂（包括单质金属氧化物和支持系统）之间的相互作用对于实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。这一过程的挑战包括有效激活C-H键、形成M-烷基中间体以及2H-摘除，这些因素共同影响过程效率。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着重要作用，因为活性位点的大小和结构可以显著影响反应结果。例如，在丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的情况下，需要一系列步骤，涉及从分子中摘除8个氢原子、插入3个氧原子和14个电子转移。铁羟磷酸盐催化剂含有不同大小的FeO 6八面体簇，被发现对异丁酸氧化为甲基丙烯酸具有活性。观察到最佳的活性和选择性是在Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2相中，该相包含FeO 6八面体簇的三聚体。其他具有类似结构的无机化合物也显示出催化活性。钙离子的存在、硅酸盐阴离子以及FeO 6八面体簇的大小可以影响催化性能。为了提高支持氧化物催化剂的效率，采用控制pH水平的钼酸盐溶液浸渍等方法。这些因素共同表明优化氧化脱氢过程的各种参数之间的复杂性和依赖性。
