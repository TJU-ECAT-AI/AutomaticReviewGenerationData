<p>It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.</p>
<p>For instance n-butane oxidation reaction to maleic anhydride necessitates 7 lattice oxide ions, 8 hydrogen atoms abstraction from the substrate, 3 oxygen atoms insertion and 14 electrons transfer!</p>
<p>Each case corresponds to specific properties.</p>
<p>Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.</p>
<p>Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.</p>
<p>Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).</p>
<p>It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-alkyl complex (as usually admitted) or a 8-alkyl complex.</p>
<p>Due to the layered structure of MoO 3, the lattice oxide ions are much more labile in the (0k0) plane than in the others.</p>
<p>The (100) face of (VO)2P207 corresponding to the (lk0) plane was shown to be the active and selective face.</p>
<p>In a recent paper Grasselli et al. [10] pro- posed a mechanism with activated 0 2- (per- oxo) species on unsaturated V ion at the surface and have proposed that the active site is com- posed of an ensemble of four dimers isolated one from the other by excess of phosphate species as schematised in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>It was shown that the active phase was a phosphate with iron ion at a two oxidation states + 2 and + 3, ctFe3(P207) 2,composed of trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octa- hedra (as schematized in Fig. 4a) separated one from the other by PO 4 tetrahedra.</p>
<p>Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds.</p>
<p>One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.</p>
<p>One will see that well dispersed species of limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- liar catalytic properties.</p>
<p>For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.</p>
<p>The idea is here to determine how a support may modify the catalytic properties of the dif- ferent oxide species (as inorganic clusters of different size).</p>

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes requires multiple steps, including oxygen ion replenishment, hydrogen atom extraction, and electron transfer, involving various catalysts. Different catalysts, whether bulk metal oxides or supported systems, play crucial roles in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges in achieving high selectivity include the need for efficient C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction.

2. The selectivity of the process is influenced by the interplay between catalyst structure, reactivity, and the specific conditions under which the reaction takes place. Factors such as the size of active sites, the coordination environment around metal centers, and the mobility of lattice oxygen ions contribute significantly to process efficiency.

3. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues. The arrangement and size of clusters of metal oxide atoms, such as double trimers or ensembles of four dimers, affect the reaction pathways and product distribution. By controlling the size and structure of these active sites, catalysts can be optimized for specific ODH reactions, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates.

4. Catalysts are considered dynamically under reaction conditions, reflecting the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and the mobility of lattice oxygen ions. Achieving a steady state requires a certain period on stream, and for some catalysts, this might extend to hundreds of hours before reaching optimal performance. The optimization of catalyst parameters, such as the VS+/V4+ ion ratio in supported systems, can help in maintaining high selectivity and conversion rates over extended periods.

1. 脱氢烷烃反应需要多个步骤，包括氧离子补充、氢原子提取和电子转移，涉及各种催化剂。无论是单质金属氧化物还是支持系统，都对实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。选择性挑战包括高效C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体形成和2H提取。

2. 这个过程的选择性受到催化剂结构、活性和反应条件之间相互作用的影响。因素如活性位点的大小、金属中心周围的配位环境以及晶格氧离子的流动性，对过程效率有着显著影响。

3. 点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。金属氧化物原子簇的排列和大小，例如双二聚体或四二聚体的集合，影响反应途径和产品分布。通过控制这些活性位点的大小和结构，催化剂可以优化特定的脱氢烷烃反应，从而提高选择性和转化率。

4. 在反应条件下考虑催化剂为动态，反映马尔斯和范克里夫恩机制以及晶格氧离子的流动性。达到稳定状态需要一定的运行时间，并且对于某些催化剂，这可能需要数百小时才能达到最佳性能。通过优化催化剂参数，如支持系统中的VS+/V4+离子比率，可以帮助维持长期的选择性和转化率。
