[1] "Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice oxygen ions. Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring."
[2] "Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."
[3] "Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reactions."
[4] "For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts."
[5] "It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe that the reactions typically follow the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen ions. These ions exhibit distinct catalytic properties, acting either electrophilically or nucleophilically. Electrophilic oxygen interacts with double bonds or aromatic rings, whereas nucleophilic oxygen engages with C-H bonds adjacent to these functional groups.

The active sites in oxidation reactions are considered molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms. Their size significantly impacts the catalytic properties. For instance, double trimers of FeO6 octahedra are highly effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates. Similarly, ensembles of four VO6 octahedra are proposed as active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.

The size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is crucial and varies depending on the specific reaction and the support material used. Parameters like the reducibility and reoxidability of the oxides also play significant roles in the catalytic performance of the materials.

To address selectivity issues in ODH, site isolation becomes a critical factor. By controlling the size and structure of the active sites, catalysts can achieve high selectivity and conversion rates. The dynamic view of oxidation catalysts under reaction conditions is fundamental for understanding their operational efficiency.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）分析中，我们发现反应通常遵循马尔斯和范克里夫恩机制，涉及晶格氧离子。这些离子显示出电磷酸或核磷酸特性，并因此表现出不同的催化性质，因为电磷酸氧与双键或芳香环相互作用，而核磷酸氧则与双键或芳香环附近的C-H键相互作用。

氧化反应的活性位点被认为是金属氧化物原子的分子“无机簇”。它们的大小显著影响催化性能。例如，铁羟基磷酸盐上的双FeO6八面体三聚体特别适合异丁酸氧化为甲基丙烯酸。同样，四聚体VO6八面体簇被提议作为范德瓦尔斯磷酸盐催化剂中的活性位点，用于丁烷氧化为马来酸酐。

这些“无机分子簇”的大小作为活性位点是重要的，并且根据考虑的特定反应和支持材料的不同而变化。氧化物的可还原性和再氧化性参数对催化反应性能具有重要作用。

为了解决ODH的选择性问题，位点隔离变得至关重要。通过控制活性位点的大小和结构，催化剂可以实现高选择性和转化率。在反应条件下考虑氧化催化剂的动态视图对于理解其操作效率是基本的。
