[1] "Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice oxygen ions. Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring."
[2] "The size of the deposited oxide species (mono- meric, polymeric, bulk-type) results in different catalytic properties."
[3] "For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts."
[4] "It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used."

1. Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis typically follow the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen ions. These ions can exhibit either electrophilic or nucleophilic behavior, influencing their catalytic properties based on whether they interact with a double bond, aromatic ring, or C-H bond in the vicinity of these functional groups.

2. The size of the deposited oxide species significantly impacts catalytic properties. Smaller, monomeric species tend to exhibit acidic characteristics, while larger, polymeric species often offer better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than bulk-type oxides.

3. For instance, double trimers of FeO6 octahedra are notably active and selective for isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates. Similarly, ensembles of four VO6 octahedra are proposed to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.

4. It is evident that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' serving as active sites plays a crucial role in the efficiency of the process, varying depending on the reaction type and the support used.

1. 气相异质催化中的氧化反应通常遵循马尔斯和范克雷文机制，涉及晶格氧离子。这些离子可以表现出亲电或亲核性，根据它们是否与双键、芳香环或双键附近的C-H键相互作用，影响其催化性质。

2. 所沉积的氧化物物种的大小显著影响催化性质。较小的单体物种往往展现出酸性特征，而较大的聚集体物种在许多部分氧化反应中往往比块状氧化物具有更好的选择性。

3. 例如，FeO6八面体的双三元体对在铁羟磷酸盐上进行异丁酸氧化脱氢生成甲基丙烯酸表现出特别的活性和选择性。同样，VO6八面体的四个二聚体被提议是范德华磷酸盐催化剂中丁烷氧化生成马来酸的活性位点。

4. 显然，作为活性位点的这些“无机分子簇”的大小对于过程效率至关重要，这取决于所考虑的反应类型和支持的使用。
