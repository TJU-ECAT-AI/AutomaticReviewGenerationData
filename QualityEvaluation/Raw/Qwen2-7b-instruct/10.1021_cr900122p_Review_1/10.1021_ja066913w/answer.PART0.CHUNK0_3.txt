[1] "Production of chemicals from methane is dominated by technologies that require first the formation of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which is usually referred to as synthesis gas: Synthesis gas production is capital intensive, and the breaking of CH bonds in eqs 1 and 2 has to be substantially reversed in subsequent steps to produce hydrocarbons."
[2] "The need to utilize methane efficiently as a chemical feedstock is becoming more urgent due to diminishing proven reserves and increasing consumption of crude oil."
[3] "Our results suggest that methane activation proceeds through oxidation-reduction reactions on the surface of a catalyst that has, surprisingly, only an irreducible metal lanthanum."
[4] "Kinetic measurements were first used to confirm that the oxidative chlorination of methane (eq 5) is actually catalyzed by LaOCl by comparing reaction rates for two identical parallel reactors: one reactor was filled with LaOCl and another one with quartz chips, which are considered chemically inert but increase the contact surface area to make a valid blank experiment."
[5] "The ability of the catalyst to sustain methane chlorination in the absence of HCl for an extended period of time (segment 4 in Figure 2) demonstrates that the lanthanum structure can serve as a chlorine reservoir capable of an efficient exchange of lattice chlorine for another anion, in this case oxygen."
[6] "The proposed reaction mechanism, thus, involves changing of the formal oxidation state of surface chlorine from 1 to +1 without any changes in the oxidation state of the underlying metal."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature discusses the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in the process include C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by these factors, and site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The literature highlights the use of lanthanum-based catalysts, specifically lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl), for selective production of methyl chloride from methane. Kinetic measurements confirm the catalytic role of LaOCl in methane activation through oxidation-reduction reactions on the surface of the catalyst, without changes in the oxidation state of the underlying metal. The catalyst's ability to sustain methane chlorination in the absence of HCl indicates its efficiency in exchanging lattice chlorine for another anion, such as oxygen. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a change in the formal oxidation state of surface chlorine from 1 to +1, facilitating methane activation on the surface of the lanthanum-based catalyst.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），文献讨论了各种催化剂，包括体金属氧化物和支持系统，在实现高选择性和转化率方面的应用。该过程面临的挑战包括C-H键激活、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H抽取。这些因素共同影响了过程的效率，而位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。文献强调了镧系金属催化剂的应用，特别是镧氧氯化物（LaOCl），用于从甲烷选择性生产甲基氯化物。动力学测量证实了LaOCl在表面氧化还原反应中的催化作用，这种反应发生在催化剂上，没有改变底层金属的氧化状态。催化剂能够持续在没有HCl的情况下进行甲烷氯化，表明它在交换晶格氯离子为另一种离子，如氧离子方面具有高效性。提出的反应机制涉及表面氯原子的氧化，其形式的氧化态从1变为+1，从而在镧系金属基催化剂的表面上促进甲烷激活。
