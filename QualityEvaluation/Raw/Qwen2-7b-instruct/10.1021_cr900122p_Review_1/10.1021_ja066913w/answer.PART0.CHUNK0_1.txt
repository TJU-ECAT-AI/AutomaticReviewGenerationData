[1] "Activity and spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that La-based catalysts (LaOCl, LaCl3, and La phases with an intermediate extent of chlorination) are active for methane conversion to methyl chloride in the presence of hydrogen chloride and oxygen (Figures 24)."
[2] "These La-based catalysts appear to be very stable: no deactivation was detected after three weeks of testing."
[3] "Although LaCl3 was known as a catalyst promoter for hydrocarbon chlorination, it was never considered as a catalyst by itself because it was believed that a reducible metal was required for a catalytic site."
[4] "At methane conversions below 12 mol %, the catalyst was 100% selective toward CH3Cl."
[5] "Only trace amounts of CHCl3 were detected, and CCl4 was never detected."
[6] "Based on this evidence, methane chlorination is proposed to proceed through the surface chlorine species that can be activated by oxygen."
[7] "DFT calculations suggest that O2 can activate surface Cl- species by dissociatively adsorbing and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1 (Figure 5)."
[8] "The proposed catalytic cycle, thus, involves oxidation of a surface chlorine without any changes in the oxidation state of the underlying metal (eqs 1012), which is significantly different from known mechanisms of oxidative chlorination."

The study analyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) using various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are discussed, focusing on the interplay between catalyst types and the proposed reaction mechanisms. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the reaction pathways and improving the conversion of alkanes into desired products.
