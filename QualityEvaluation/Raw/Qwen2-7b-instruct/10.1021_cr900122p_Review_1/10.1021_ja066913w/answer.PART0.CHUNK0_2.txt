[1] "Activity and spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that La-based catalysts (LaOCl, LaCl3, and La phases with an intermediate extent of chlorination) are active for methane conversion to methyl chloride in the presence of hydrogen chloride and oxygen (Figures 24)."
[2] "These La-based catalysts appear to be very stable: no deactivation was detected after three weeks of testing."
[3] "Although LaCl3 was known as a catalyst promoter for hydrocarbon chlorination, it was never considered as a catalyst by itself because it was believed that a reducible metal was required for a catalytic site."
[4] "The irreducibility of La (the fact that it does not change its nominal +3 oxidation state) under evaluated reaction conditions was tested with XPS measurements."
[5] "At methane conversions below 12 mol %, the catalyst was 100% selective toward CH3Cl."
[6] "At higher conversions, CH3Cl was always the main product but CH2Cl2, CO, and CO2 were also observed."
[7] "Only trace amounts of CHCl3 were detected, and CCl4 was never detected."
[8] "The dependence of selectivity to CH3Cl as a function of CH4 conversion for La-based catalysts appears to be in line with that expected for gas-phase chlorination based on kinetic modeling of relative reaction rates for CH4 and CH3Cl chlorination (Figure 6)."
[9] "Kinetic measurements were performed for the reactions of (1) Cl incorporation into C1 hydrocarbons when CH4, O2, and HCl were fed and (2) Cl evolution as Cl2 when O2 and HCl were fed (Figure 1)."
[10] "Formation of Cl2 was not detected in the presence of CH4."
[11] "When CH4 was not present in the feed, the rates of Cl2 formation were usually significantly lower than those for CH4 chlorination under similar conditions."
[12] "In addition, apparent reaction orders in reactants were different for the two reactions, suggesting that they are not correlated and that CH4 activation proceeds through a surface reaction."
[13] "Flow and pulse experiments using CH4 and O2 as feed show that CH3Cl can be formed using chlorine from the catalyst surface (Figures 2 and 4)."
[14] "The presence of HCl, thus, is not required for activity, and its role appears to be limited to maintaining the extent of catalyst chlorination."
[15] "In contrast, the presence of gas-phase O2 is essential for catalytic activity (Figure 2)."
[16] "Based on this evidence, methane chlorination is proposed to proceed through the surface chlorine species that can be activated by oxygen."
[17] "DFT calculations suggest that O2 can activate surface Cl- species by dissociatively adsorbing and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1 (Figure 5)."
[18] "The formation of OCl- species was not detected using static adsorption, TPD, and infrared and Raman spectroscopic measurements, and therefore, these species are assumed to be transient."
[19] "DFT calculations suggest that these OCl- species can serve as an active site for methane activation."
[20] "The proposed catalytic cycle, thus, involves oxidation of a surface chlorine without any changes in the oxidation state of the underlying metal (eqs 1012), which is significantly different from known mechanisms of oxidative chlorination."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, the document highlights the use of lanthanum-based catalysts for selective production of methyl chloride from methane. The key factors influencing process efficiency and selectivity include:

1. **Catalyst Type**: The study uses lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl), lanthanum trichloride (LaCl3), and intermediate chlorinated lanthanum phases, demonstrating their effectiveness in the reaction despite the irreducibility of lanthanum. 

2. **Stability**: The catalysts show remarkable stability, with no detectable deactivation after extensive testing, suggesting their durability in industrial applications.

3. **Role of HCl**: Contrary to expectations, hydrogen chloride (HCl) is not required for activity. Its presence merely maintains the extent of catalyst chlorination, not driving the reaction.

4. **Essential Role of O2**: Oxygen (O2) is indispensable for catalytic activity, highlighting its crucial role in activating the surface chlorine species.

5. **Mechanism**: The proposed mechanism involves oxidation of surface chlorine without altering the underlying metal's oxidation state, differing from conventional oxidative chlorination processes. This unique mechanism allows for selective production of methyl chloride.

6. **Selectivity and Conversion**: The catalysts maintain near-perfect selectivity towards methyl chloride (CH3Cl) at low methane conversion levels, with selectivity declining at higher conversions but still showing the formation of minor products like CH2Cl2, CO, and CO2.

7. **Modeling and Kinetics**: The study employs kinetic modeling to predict selectivity trends, aligning with expectations for gas-phase chlorination processes, thus validating the proposed mechanism and the catalyst's performance.

The document emphasizes the innovative use of lanthanum-based catalysts in methane activation, offering a new pathway for the selective production of methyl chloride. The stability, selectivity, and the distinct catalytic mechanism presented in the study promise improvements in efficiency and environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，文献强调了镧系基催化剂在甲烷转化为甲氯化物中的选择性生产。影响过程效率和选择性的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂类型：研究使用镧氧氯化物（LaOCl）、镧三氯化物（LaCl3）和中间程度氯化的镧相，证明了它们在反应中的有效性，尽管镧的不可还原性。

2. 稳定性：催化剂显示出惊人的稳定性，在长时间测试后未检测到失活，暗示其在工业应用中的耐用性。

3. HCl的作用：与预期相反，氢氯酸（HCl）对于活性不是必需的。它的存在仅维持催化剂的氯化程度，而不是驱动反应。

4. O2的关键作用：氧气（O2）是催化活性不可或缺的，突出了它激活表面氯原子物种的作用。

5. 机制：提出的机制涉及表面氯化物的氧化而不改变基础金属的氧化状态，这与传统的氧化氯化过程不同。这一独特的机制允许选择性地生产甲氯化物。

6. 选择性和转化率：催化剂在低甲烷转化水平下保持接近完美的选择性，向甲氯化物（CH3Cl），在较高转化率下选择性降低但仍显示形成少量产品如CH2Cl2、CO和CO2。

7. 模型和动力学：研究采用动力学建模来预测选择性趋势，与气体相氯化过程的预期一致，从而验证了提出的机制和催化剂的性能。

文献强调了镧系基催化剂在甲烷活化中的创新使用，提供了一种新的选择性生产甲氯化物的途径。在稳定、选择性和独特的催化机制方面，该研究提出了与传统方法相比的改进，有望提高效率并减少环境影响。
