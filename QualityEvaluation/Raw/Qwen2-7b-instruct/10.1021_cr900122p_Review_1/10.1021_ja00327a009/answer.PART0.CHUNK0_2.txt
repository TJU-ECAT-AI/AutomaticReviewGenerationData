[1] "The oxidation of methane may be understood in terms of nonselective redox reactions and a selective reaction cycle."
[2] "The intermediates MoVIO-, CH3., and OCHq have now been identified on this catalyst, although not under reaction conditions."
[3] "Formaldehyde, which is the other selective oxidation product, may be formed both by the direct decomposition of methoxide ions and by the secondary reaction of methanol."
[4] "Every step in this cycle occurs rapidly at 600 O C relative to reactions 4 and 5."
[5] "Iron molybdates are known to be selective catalysts for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, and we have demonstrated in a separate study that Mo/Si02 is also an effective catalyst for this reaction."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves a complex interplay between catalysts, aiming to achieve high selectivity and conversion rates. Challenges include the efficient activation of C-H bonds, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and the precise control of hydrogen abstraction steps. Site isolation plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by limiting unwanted pathways and promoting the desired reaction sequence. The proposed mechanisms involve the initiation by reactive oxygen forms, leading to the generation of methyl radicals and methoxide ions, which further decompose into formaldehyde or methanol. The high activity of molybdenum-based catalysts, especially when supported on silica, enables selective oxidation of alkanes, demonstrating their effectiveness in processes such as the conversion of methane to methanol and formaldehyde. This showcases the potential of molybdenum-containing catalysts in addressing the challenges of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation, contributing to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly industrial processes.
