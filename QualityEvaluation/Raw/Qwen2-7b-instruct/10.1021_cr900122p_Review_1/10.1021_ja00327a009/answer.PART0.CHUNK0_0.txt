[1] "The oxidation of methane may be understood in terms of nonselective redox reactions and a selective reaction cycle."
[2] "The intermediates MoVIO-, CH3., and OCHq have now been identified on this catalyst, although not under reaction conditions."
[3] "Formaldehyde, which is the other selective oxidation product, may be formed both by the direct decomposition of methoxide ions and by the secondary reaction of methanol."
[4] "On the basis of this mechanism the overall rate equation for the conversion of methane may be derived."
[5] "Since reaction 7 occurs at 25 O C and reaction 5 at much higher temperatures"
[6] "The selective cycle may be described by the reactions MoV + N 2 0  2 MoVIO- + N2"
[7] "Every step in this cycle occurs rapidly at 600 O C relative to reactions 4 and 5."
[8] "If these conditions do not prevail, the molybdenum will be oxidized to MoV1 (reaction 5) and HCHO or C H 3 0 H will compete with CH4 in reaction 4."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the intricate nature of these reactions, requiring precise control over reaction conditions and catalyst properties. The proposed reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of the process. Site isolation, a technique aimed at enhancing selectivity, addresses the issue by segregating active sites on the catalyst surface, thereby minimizing unwanted side reactions and promoting the desired transformation of alkanes into alkenes and beyond.
