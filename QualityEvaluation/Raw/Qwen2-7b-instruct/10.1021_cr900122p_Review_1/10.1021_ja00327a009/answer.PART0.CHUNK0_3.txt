[1] "The oxidation of methane may be understood in terms of nonselective redox reactions and a selective reaction cycle."
[2] "The intermediates MoVIO-, CH3., and OCHq have now been identified on this catalyst, although not under reaction conditions."
[3] "Every step in this cycle occurs rapidly at 600 O C relative to reactions 4 and 5."
[4] "The active site for partial oxidation is believed to be a highly dispersed form of molybdenum on silica as indicated by the ob- servation that at comparable conversions smaller concentrations of molybdenum results in a greater selectivity for methanol."

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
