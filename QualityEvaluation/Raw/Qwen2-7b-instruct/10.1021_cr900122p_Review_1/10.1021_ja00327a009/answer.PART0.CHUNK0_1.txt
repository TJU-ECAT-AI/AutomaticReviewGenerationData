[1] "The oxidation of methane may be understood in terms of nonselective redox reactions and a selective reaction cycle."
[2] "The intermediates MoVIO-, CH3., and OCHq have now been identified on this catalyst, although not under reaction conditions."
[3] "Formaldehyde, which is the other selective oxidation product,may be formed both by the direct decomposition of methoxide ions and by the secondary reaction of methanol."
[4] "Even in this case the methoxide ion is considered to be an important intermediate."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves a complex interplay between catalysts, selectivity, conversion, and reaction mechanisms. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in this process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the intricate nature of the reactions involved, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the 2H-abstraction pathway. Site isolation is a key factor in addressing selectivity issues, as it allows for the creation of specific reaction environments that favor the desired product over unwanted byproducts. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability of the catalyst to selectively activate bonds and intermediates, leading to the formation of the targeted alkene or hydrocarbon derivatives. In the context of the document, the proposed reaction mechanisms highlight the importance of oxygen-containing species, particularly the reactive 0- ions, in initiating a sequence of reactions that involve the formation of methyl radicals and methoxide ions. These intermediates can then undergo further reactions to produce the desired products, such as methanol or formaldehyde, demonstrating the complexity and sophistication required for achieving high conversion and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
