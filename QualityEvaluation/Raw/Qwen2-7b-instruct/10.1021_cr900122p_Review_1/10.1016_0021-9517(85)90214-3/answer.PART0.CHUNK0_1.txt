[1] "The partial oxidation of methane to methanol or to formaldehyde provides intriguing new opportunities for the production of liquid fuels and chemicals."
[2] "In the temperature range of SO-580C and at 1 atm total reactant pressure methane can be oxidized selectively to CHsOH and HCHO in the presence of N20 and Hz0 at low conversions (l-2%) and at low contact times."
[3] "V205 produces methanol and formaldehyde selectively and at comparable conversions in the temperature range of 460-500C. This is a significantly lower temperature range than that employed when using molybdenum oxide catalysts."
[4] "The activation energies of HCHO and CH30H formation are different, 22 + 2 and 40 -+ 4 k&/mole, indicating that their formation is by parallel reaction paths instead of the consecutive reaction sequence found on molybdena."
[5] "The chemisorption of methane which occurs with a very low reaction probability produces a methoxy group, CH30-, and a hydroxyl group. Hydrolysis of the methoxy group by water yields methanol and another hydroxyl group on the vanadium oxide surface."

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
