[1] "The partial oxidation of methane to methanol or to formaldehyde provides intriguing new opportunities for the production of liquid fuels and chemicals."
[2] "Our continued investigation uncovered that silica-supported vanadium pentoxide is also a good catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane and the purpose of this paper is to report our findings."
[3] "V205 produces methanol and formaldehyde selectively and at comparable conversions in the temperature range of 460-500C. This is a significantly lower temperature range than that employed when using molybdenum oxide catalysts."
[4] "The rate equations can be rationalized assuming the presence of a methoxy, -0CH3, reaction intermediate that may hydrolyze to form methanol or may lose one or more hydrogen atoms to yield HCHO or CO."
[5] "The activation energies of HCHO and CH30H formation are different, 22 + 2 and 40 -+ 4 k&/mole, respectively, indicating that their formation is by parallel reaction paths instead of the consecutive reaction sequence found on molybdena."

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
