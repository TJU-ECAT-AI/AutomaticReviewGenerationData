[1] "Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (eq 4).1"
[2] "We also tested the V2O5·6SiO2 (34 wt % V2O5) xerogel that had been calcined at 500 C for its catalytic properties."
[3] "Reactions conditions: 0.025 g of catalyst, 0.500 g of quartz chips, ambient pressure, feed ratio O2/C3H8/He of 8:25:200, flow rate range 30233 mL min-1."
[4] "The selectivities and activities for propene formation, extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, were 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C."
[5] "For this reason, studies on the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons have focused on metal oxide catalysts, which can provide alternative (and more selective) oxidation pathways."
[6] "The high oxidation potential for vanadium(V) oxide and the ease with which vanadium can shuttle between the +5, +4, and +3 oxidation states make vanadium a popular element of choice for the active component in heterogeneous oxidation catalysts."
[7] "Clearly, molecular model compounds in which the chemical composition and coordination sphere closely resemble those present in 1a would offer valuable comparative data."
[8] "An attractive alternative approach is suggested by the single-source precursor route to mixed-element oxides, which has been employed by our group in the synthesis of a number of highly dispersed metal oxidesilica materials."
[9] "In general, a challenging aspect of the synthesis of tailored vanadiasilica catalysts is the development of methods for the homogeneous incorporation of vanadium into the structure, particularly at high vanadium loadings."
[10] "Our observation of only one charge-transfer band, with a similar molar absorptivity as the most intense OV(OSi)3 chromophore of 1a (as prepared by Stiegman and Scott), suggests that assignments for such bands in vanadia silica materials may not be as straightforward as previously believed."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various factors including the catalyst's selectivity and conversion efficiency, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it helps in maintaining the integrity of reactive sites, reducing cross-reactions, and enhancing the efficiency of the process. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are often due to the difficulty in controlling the reaction pathway, preventing unwanted side reactions, and optimizing the catalyst's properties. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, have been developed to tackle these challenges. The selectivity of the catalyst is often assessed through the conversion of the alkane to the desired product, and the conversion efficiency is determined by the yield of the product. The reaction mechanisms typically involve C-H bond activation, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps, which collectively influence the process efficiency. The site isolation strategy can improve selectivity by minimizing the interaction between the active sites, thereby enhancing the overall process efficiency.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程受催化剂选择性和转化效率等多种因素的影响。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战主要源于控制反应途径的难度、防止副反应和优化催化剂性质的困难。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载系统，已被开发以解决这些挑战。催化剂的选择性通常通过烷烃转化为目标产物的转化率来评估，而转化效率则由产物的产率确定。反应机制通常涉及C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成和2H-摘除步骤，这些步骤共同影响过程效率。位点隔离策略可以通过减少活性位点之间的相互作用来改善选择性，从而提高整体过程效率。
