[3] "Reactions conditions: 0.025 g of catalyst, 0.500 g of quartz chips, ambient pressure, feed ratio O2/C3H8/He of 8:25:200, flow rate range 30233 mL min-1."
[4] "The selectivities and activities for propene formation, extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, were 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), this study demonstrates the effectiveness of vanadium silicalite catalysts. The vanadium silicalite material, known for its efficiency in propane ODH, was used as a benchmark. The catalysts were evaluated under specific conditions including a catalyst dosage of 0.025 g, 0.500 g of quartz chips as support, ambient pressure, and an O2/C3H8/He feed ratio of 8:25:200. The flow rate ranged from 30 to 233 mL/min. 

The results showed high propene selectivities of 86.6%, 82.1%, and 73.2% at reaction temperatures of 400, 450, and 500°C, respectively. The corresponding propene production rates were 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1, 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1, and 19 mmol g-1 h-1, respectively. These findings highlight the capability of the catalysts in achieving high conversion and selectivity, essential for efficient ODH processes. The high propene selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, indicates a well-controlled reaction mechanism and effective activation of C-H bonds leading to propene formation without substantial secondary combustion.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的分析中，这项研究证明了范德华硅酸盐催化剂的有效性。众所周知，范德华硅酸盐材料因其在丙烷ODH中的高效性而被用作基准。对催化剂进行了评估，具体条件包括催化剂剂量为0.025克，0.500克石英芯片作为支撑物，常压以及O2/C3H8/He进料比为8:25:200。流速范围从30至233毫升/分钟。

结果表明，在400、450和500°C时，丙烯选择性分别为86.6%、82.1%和73.2%，相应的丙烯产率分别为2.1毫摩尔/克小时、5.6毫摩尔/克小时和19毫摩尔/克小时。这些发现强调了催化剂在实现高转化率和选择性方面的能力，这对于高效的ODH过程至关重要。特别是较低温度下较高的丙烯选择性表明了反应机制的严格控制和有效的C-H键活化，从而导致丙烯形成，同时避免了副燃烧。
