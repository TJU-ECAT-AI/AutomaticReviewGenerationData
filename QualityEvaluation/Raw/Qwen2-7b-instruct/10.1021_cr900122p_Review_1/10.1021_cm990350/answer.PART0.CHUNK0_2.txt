Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, presents significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The document highlights the use of vanadiasilica materials as catalysts for selective oxidations, emphasizing their ability to operate at low vanadium loadings. The high oxidation potential of vanadium(V) oxide and its capacity to shuttle between multiple oxidation states make vanadium a preferred element for active components in heterogeneous oxidation catalysts. 

Selective oxidation pathways are typically sought after to avoid nonselective processes that often lead to complete combustion or CC bond cleavage. Metal oxide catalysts, such as those containing vanadium, are advantageous because they can offer more selective oxidation pathways. Zeolitic materials, such as vanadiumsilicalite, are among the most ordered systems that incorporate a small percentage of silicon substituted by vanadium, facilitating selective oxidations of light hydrocarbons.

Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues, with molecular model compounds closely resembling the chemical composition and coordination sphere of isolated vanadyl sites on silica serving as valuable comparatives. The single-source precursor route to mixed-element oxides, demonstrated in the synthesis of highly dispersed metal oxidesilica materials, offers an attractive alternative to traditional wet impregnation methods for achieving high dispersion.

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of a vanadyl tert-butoxy orthosilicate, OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3, which acts as a model for isolated vanadyl sites on silica and as a precursor to vanadia-silica xerogels. This compound is synthesized through a reaction of OVCl3 with HOSi(OtBu)3, and its spectroscopic properties, including UV-vis, Raman, IR, and NMR, are extensively analyzed. The thermolysis of this precursor results in the formation of a green gel, which upon drying and calcination yields a xerogel with a high surface area, average pore size, and total pore volume. 

The xerogel is found to exhibit similar catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to bulk V2O5, indicating its potential as an effective catalyst for this process. The selectivity and activity of the catalyst are reported, showing high propene selectivity and comparable activity to other systems, suggesting advantages over traditional impregnation methods. The document also mentions future work aimed at producing ternary V/Si/M/O xerogels through a thermolysis-hydrolysis procedure using 5 and metal alkoxides, highlighting ongoing efforts to improve catalyst performance and selectivity in ODH reactions.

The role of site isolation in enhancing selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions is evident in the document's emphasis on the development of model compounds and the utilization of vanadiasilica materials as catalysts. The document underscores the importance of understanding the chemical composition, coordination sphere, and spectroscopic properties of isolated vanadyl sites on silica for improving catalyst design and performance in selective oxidation processes.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，各种催化剂之间的交互作用，包括块体金属氧化物和支撑系统，在实现高选择性和转化方面存在重大挑战。文献强调了使用范德萨利卡材料作为轻烃选择性氧化的催化剂，它们能够在较低的钒负载下操作。

高氧化电位的钒(V)氧化物以及钒能够穿梭于+5、+4和+3氧化态之间，使得钒成为在异质氧化催化中选择性较高的元素。通常，非选择性过程会导致完全燃烧或CC键断裂，因此选择性氧化途径是研究的重点。包含范德萨利的沸石型材料，如范德萨利硅酸盐，是具有较高选择性氧化轻烃能力的最有序体系之一，其中少量硅被范德萨利取代。

在文献中，隔离位点在解决选择性问题中发挥着关键作用，通过与二氧化硅表面类似且化学组成和配位球形相似的分子模型化合物作为有价值的比较数据。单一来源前驱体路线到混合元素氧化物的使用，展示了在分散金属氧化物二氧化硅材料中的高度分散替代传统浸渍方法的优势。

文献讨论了合成并表征了三氧钒正丁氧基正硅酸盐，OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3，作为二氧化硅表面类型1a的孤立范德萨尔模型，并作为范德萨利二氧化硅气凝胶的前体。该化合物通过OVCl3与HOSi(OtBu)3的反应合成，并对其进行了紫外可见光谱、拉曼光谱、红外光谱和核磁共振光谱的详细分析。这种前驱体的热解产生了一种绿色凝胶，干燥和煅烧后形成具有高表面积、平均孔径和总孔体积的气凝胶。

所形成的气凝胶表现出与纯V2O5相似的丙烷氧化脱氢催化性能，表明其作为此过程催化剂的潜力。文献报道了催化剂的选择性和活性，显示出高丙烯选择性和与其它系统的相似活性，暗示与传统浸渍方法相比可能具有优势。文献还提到了未来工作集中在通过热解水解程序使用5和金属醇盐制备三元V/Si/M/O气凝胶的努力，突出了在ODH反应中提高催化剂性能和选择性的持续努力。

文献强调了在选择性氧化过程中通过开发模型化合物和利用范德萨利卡材料作为催化剂来增强选择性和转化的重要性。文献强调了理解二氧化硅表面上孤立的范德萨尔位点的化学组成、配位球形及其光谱性质对于改进催化剂设计和性能的重要性。
