[1] "Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (eq 4)."
[2] "We also tested the V2O5·6SiO2 (34 wt % V2O5) xerogel that had been calcined at 500 C for its catalytic properties."
[3] "The propene selectivity as a function of propane conversion is shown in Figure 11."
[4] "The activities may also be expressed on the basis of moles of vanadium (rather than grams of catalyst), as 0.16 mmol (mol V)-1 s-1 at 400 C, 0.42 mmol (mol V)-1 s-1 at 450 C, and 1.4 mmol (mol V)-1 s-1 at 500 C."
[5] "Furthermore, the latter catalyst has a lower surface area (251 m2 g-1) after being treated under an identical temperature regime and clearly contains V2O5 crystallites (by XRD and DRUVvis and Raman spectroscopy)."
[6] "The V2O5·6SiO2 xerogel is also similar to bulk V2O5 in its ODH of propane (which exhibits a selectivity of about 80%, with a catalyst surface area of 3 m2 g-1) and rapidly declining selectivity with increasing conversions."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the importance of catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are discussed, including issues related to C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues, offering a means to enhance the process efficiency. The efficiency of catalysts is influenced by their ability to effectively activate and manipulate alkane structures, leading to desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions. The document also mentions that the selectivity and activity of the catalysts are dependent on factors such as temperature, the nature of the alkane substrate, and the specific structure of the catalyst itself. The comparison of the V2O5·6SiO2 xerogel catalyst with bulk V2O5 reveals that while both exhibit similar selectivity for propane ODH, the xerogel shows a rapid decline in selectivity with increasing conversions, possibly due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites that may hinder the catalytic activity. This insight underscores the complexity of optimizing catalysts for alkane ODH processes and the ongoing efforts to develop more efficient and selective catalysts.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，文献强调了如块状金属氧化物和负载型催化剂的重要性。高选择性和转化率的挑战被讨论，包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H抽取。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，为提高过程效率提供了途径。催化剂效率受其有效激活和调控烷烃结构的能力影响，导致所需产品的同时减少不需要的副反应。文献还指出，催化剂的选择性和活性依赖于因素如温度、烷烃底物的性质以及催化剂本身的特定结构。V2O5·6SiO2无定形凝胶催化剂与块状V2O5的比较显示，尽管两者均表现出相似的丙烷ODH选择性，但无定形凝胶的转化率随转化率增加而迅速下降，这可能归因于形成了可能妨碍催化活性的大V2O5晶粒。这一见解突出了优化烷烃ODH过程催化剂的复杂性，并表明继续发展更高效和选择性催化剂的努力仍然存在。
