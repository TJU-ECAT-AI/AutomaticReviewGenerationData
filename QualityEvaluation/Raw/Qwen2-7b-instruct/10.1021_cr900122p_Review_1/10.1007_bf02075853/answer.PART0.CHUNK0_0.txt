The study examines the impact of various additives, such as K2O, Cr2O3, Sm2O3, and Nb2O5, on the performance of V-Mg-O catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It reveals that the addition of these additives generally decreases both the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Specifically, the addition of chromium (Cr) led to a significantly lower activity compared to the undoped catalyst, contradicting its reported promoting effect in butane oxidation. The ease of reduction for the catalysts follows the order VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK. The activity of the catalysts also decreases in a similar order, while the selectivity to propylene increases with the ease of reduction, suggesting that the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective.

The authors note that there is no direct correlation between catalyst activity and reducibility, but there is a clear relationship between selectivity and reducibility, where the most easily reduced catalyst exhibits the highest selectivity for propylene production. This finding supports the idea that the redox behavior of the catalysts under reaction conditions plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. However, the exact mechanism by which catalyst reducibility facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction remains unclear, necessitating further investigation.

研究分析了不同添加剂（如K2O、Cr2O3、Sm2O3和Nb2O5）对V-Mg-O催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的性能影响。结果显示，这些添加剂通常会降低催化剂的活性和选择性。具体来说，添加铬（Cr）导致催化剂活性显著降低，与它在丁烷氧化中的报道促进作用相矛盾。催化剂的还原性容易程度遵循以下顺序：VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK。催化剂的活性也遵循类似的顺序降低，而丙烯的选择性随着还原性的增加而提高，表明最易还原的催化剂具有最高的丙烯生成选择性。

作者指出，催化剂活性与还原性之间没有直接相关性，但选择性和还原性之间存在清晰的关系，即最易还原的催化剂具有最高丙烯选择性。这支持了催化剂在反应条件下表现出的氧化还原行为在氧化脱氢过程中起着关键作用的观点。然而，催化剂还原性如何促进脱氢反应的确切机制仍不清楚，需要进一步的研究。
