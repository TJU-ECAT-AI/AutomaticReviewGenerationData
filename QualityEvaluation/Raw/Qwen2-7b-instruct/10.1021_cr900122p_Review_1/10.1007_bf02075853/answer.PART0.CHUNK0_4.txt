<p>While catalytic properties and structural aspects of mixed V-Mg oxides have been studied in considerable detail,information on the performance of promoters added to them is rather scanty and contradictory.</p>
<p>The addition of K20, Cr203, Sm203 or Nb205 to V-Mg-O catalyst decreased both activity and selectivity in propane oxydehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Significantly lower activity obtained for the Cr-doped catalyst contradicts the promoting effect of Cr203 in butane oxidation reported in ref. [6].</p>
<p>From these data, it can be suggested that V5+ and Mg2+,but not their reduced species were present at the surface of all the catalysts studied.</p>
<p>Note that there is no correlation between the activity and reducibility,while the selectivity to propylene follows the order reducibility,i.e., the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective.</p>

1. The study explores the impact of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are discussed, along with the proposed reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The factors influencing process efficiency are analyzed, with a focus on how site isolation helps address selectivity issues.

2. The document highlights that the addition of certain additives to V-Mg-O catalysts negatively affects both activity and selectivity in propane ODH. It contrasts the promotional effect of chromium in butane oxidation, reported in another study, with the contrary outcome observed in this research.

3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggest that V5+ and Mg2+ are present at the surface of all catalysts, rather than their reduced species. The surface V/Mg atomic ratios are measured and found to be consistent with literature data.

4. The study reveals a direct relationship between catalyst reducibility and dehydrogenation selectivity. The most easily reduced catalysts exhibit the highest selectivity for propylene production. This trend aligns with previous findings comparing the reducibility and catalytic properties of undoped V-Mg oxides.

5. The research indicates that the ease of reduction correlates with the catalytic performance in propane ODH, with the most easily reduced catalyst being the most selective. This parallelism is also observed in the case of Mg vanadates and Mo-V-Nb oxides, supporting the notion that good redox behavior under reaction conditions favors the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1. 研究探讨了用于烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）的影响，以及在高选择性和转化率方面遇到的挑战。讨论了反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽取，并分析了这些因素如何共同影响过程效率，以及位点隔离如何解决选择性问题。

2. 文献指出，将某些添加剂添加到V-Mg-O催化剂中会降低丙烷氧化脱氢的活性和选择性。它与另一项研究中关于铬在丁烷氧化中的促进作用形成对比，该研究观察到了相反的结果。

3. X射线光电子能谱（XPS）结果表明，所有催化剂表面都存在V5+和Mg2+，而不是它们的还原态。测量了表面V/Mg原子比，并与文献数据一致。

4. 研究发现，催化剂可还原性与脱氢选择性之间存在直接关系。最易还原的催化剂显示出最高的丙烯生成选择性。这一趋势与未掺杂V-Mg氧化物的还原性和催化性能的比较结果相符。

5. 研究表明，还原性的容易程度与丙烷ODH的催化性能成正比，最容易还原的催化剂具有最高选择性。这种平行关系也适用于Mg钒酸盐和Mo-V-Nb氧化物，支持了在反应条件下良好的氧化还原行为有利于氧化脱氢过程的观点。
