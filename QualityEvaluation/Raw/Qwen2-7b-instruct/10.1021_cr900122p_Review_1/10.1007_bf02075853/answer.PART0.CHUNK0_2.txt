[1] "V-Mg-O catalysts are active and relatively selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [1)4] and butane [5]."
[2] "While catalytic properties and structural aspects of mixed V-Mg oxides have been studied in considerable detail,information on the performance of promoters added to them is rather scanty and contradictory."
[3] "The selectivities to alkene are substantial the samples with vanadia contents ranging from 20 to 70 wt.%."
[4] "The addition of K20, Cr203, Sm203 or Nb205 to V-Mg-O catalyst decreased both activity and selectivity in propane oxydehydrogenation."
[5] "Taking into account that in the latter work twice as much of Cr203 was incorporated into the V-Mg-O catalyst, we prepared a catalyst which contained I0 wt.% Cr203 . It also exhibited considerably lower activity and selectivity than the undoped catalyst,thus confirming the deteriorating effect of chromium on the catalytic performance of V-Mg oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[6] "The addition of potassium or niobium did not affect the surface V/Mg ratio,whereas chromium and samarium remarkably increased it."
[7] "TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The results show that all samples had only one reduction peak with a maximum varying in the temperature range of 812-885 K (Table i)."
[8] "The ease of their reduction decreased as follows: VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK. The activity of catalysts decreased in the order VMg > VMgK > VMgNb > VMgCr > VMgSm, and the dehydrogenation selectivity was like VMg > VMgNb VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK."
[9] "There is no correlation between the activity and reducibility,while the selectivity to propylene follows the order reducibility,i.e., the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective."

1. V-Mg-O catalysts demonstrate notable activity and relative selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and butane. However, the performance of promoters added to these catalysts is scarce and contradictory.
2. The selectivity towards alkene products in V-Mg-O catalysts varies significantly based on the vanadia content, ranging from 20 to 70 wt.%
3. The inclusion of certain metal oxides like K2O, Cr2O3, Sm2O3, or Nb2O5 reduces both the activity and selectivity of V-Mg-O catalysts in propane oxydehydrogenation.
4. Chromium, when present at a higher concentration compared to other metals such as niobium or samarium, shows a detrimental effect on the catalytic performance of V-Mg oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
5. The surface V/Mg ratio remains unaffected by the addition of potassium or niobium, whereas chromium and samarium notably increase it.
6. The temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the catalysts exhibit a single reduction peak within the range of 812-885 K, indicating the presence of vanadium ions.
7. The ease of reduction of the catalysts decreases in the following order: VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK.
8. The activity of the catalysts decreases in the sequence VMg > VMgK > VMgNb > VMgCr > VMgSm, while the dehydrogenation selectivity follows the pattern VMg > VMgNb VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK.
9. There is no direct correlation between the activity and reducibility of the catalysts; however, the selectivity to propylene is positively correlated with the reducibility, suggesting that the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective.

1.V-Mg-O催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应和丁烷氧化脱氢反应中显示出明显的活性和相对的选择性。然而，添加到这些催化剂中的促进剂的性能信息稀缺且存在矛盾。
2. V-Mg-O催化剂中钒含量从20至70 wt.%时，烯烃产物的选择性变化显著。
3. 向V-Mg-O催化剂添加某些金属氧化物如K2O、Cr2O3、Sm2O3或Nb2O5会降低丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的活性和选择性。
4. 相对于其他金属如铌或钐，当铬的浓度更高时，它对V-Mg氧化物在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能产生不利影响。
5. 添加钾或铌不会影响表面V/Mg比值，而铬和钐显著增加了此比例。
6. 催化剂的温度程序化还原图谱显示了一个在812-885 K范围内的单个还原峰，表明存在五氧化二钒。
7. 催化剂的还原容易程度按以下顺序递减：VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK。
8. 催化剂的活性按序列VMg > VMgK > VMgNb > VMgCr > VMgSm递减，而脱氢选择性则遵循模式VMg > VMgNb VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK。
9. 活性和还原性之间没有直接相关性；然而，丙烯的选择性与还原性正相关，表明最容易还原的催化剂是最具选择性的。
