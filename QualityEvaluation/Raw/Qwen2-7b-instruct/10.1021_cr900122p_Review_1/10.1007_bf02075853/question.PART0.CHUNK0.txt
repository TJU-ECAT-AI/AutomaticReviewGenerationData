By comparing these results with the characterization data, a relationship between propylene selectivity and catalyst reducibility was revealed.
The most easily reduced catalyst was the most selective.
INTRODUCTION
V-Mg-O catalysts are active and relatively selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [1)4] and butane [5].
The selectivities to alkene are substantial the samples with vanadia contents ranging from 20 to 70 wt.%. While catalytic properties and structural aspects of mixed V-Mg oxides have been studied in considerable detail,information on the performance of promoters added to them is rather scanty and contradictory.
It has been reported in ref.
[6] that the addition of 2 wt.% Cr203 or MoO 3 enhanced the activity of the catalyst in butane oxidation,while TiO 2 increased the dehydrogenation selectivity.
A later paper [7] has reported,however,that V-Mg oxides containing from 1.9 to 49 wt.% MoO 3 showed, in the same reaction, a catalytic behavior that closely

VALENZUELA et al.: V-Mg-O CATALYSTS resembled that of unmodified V-Mg oxide. A detrimental effect of the presence of residual potassium in Mg vanadates on the dehydrogenation selectivity,especially in the butane reaction,has been established in ref. [8].
In this investigation,the effect of the addition of some metal oxides (K20, Cr203 Sm203 and Nb205) a to V-Mg-O catalyst has been studied. We report here the results for the oxidation of propane on modified samples and the comparison of them with data on physicochemical characterization of catalysts.
EXPERIMENTAL
All catalysts were prepared using the impregnation procedure described elsewhere [i]. MgCO 3 was first prepared by adding
(NH4)2CO
3 to a solution of Mg(N03) 2. The carbonate was then decomposed at 973 K to yield MgO with a surface area of 28 m2/g. An appropriate amount of this oxide was impregnated with an ammonium metavanadate solution and calcined at 823 K to form a mixed V-Mg oxide catalyst containing 24 wt.% V205. Its doped samples were obtained by adding the required amount of the respective compound
(KN03,
Cr(N03)3, Sm203 or Nb205) to the ammonical solution along with MgO.
Surface areas of the catalysts were measured with a BET Asap 2000 Micromeritics instrument using nitrogen as adsorbate.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Seifert XRD 3000P diffractometer using nickel-filtered CuK radiation.
FT-Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker
RFS
i00 spectrometer.
A
Nd:YAG laser with an excitation line at 1046 nm and a liquid nitrogen cooled Ge diode detector were used.
The power was usually set at 50 mW. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired with a Leybold-Heraeus
LHS-10
spectrometer.
Atomic concentration ratios were calculated by correcting the intensity ratios with theoretical sensitivity factors. Binding energies (B.E.) were referred to the adventitious Cls peak at
284.9 eV. Temperature-programmed
reduction
(TPR)
of catalysts by hydrogen was carried out with the help of a Perkin Elmer thermogravimeter equipped with a TGS II microbalance. 214 VALENZUELA et al.: V-Mg-0 CATALYSTS Propane oxidation was studied in a tubular,down-flow quartz reactor.
SiC chips were placed above the catalyst particles (0.I g, 0.42-0.59 mm) up to a total bed volume of 1 cm
3. A C3H8-O2-He mixture of 4:8:88 molar ratio was fed into
the reactor at a total flow of
0.3 mol/h
and W/F=12.3 g cat.h/mol.
Under these conditions,the homogeneous conversion of propane was negligible,being equal to 0.2 mol% at 773 K.
Reactants and products were analyzed on-line with a Varian 3400 GC with a TCD detector.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 1 presents some typical results Of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on a V-Mg oxide catalyst and its samples modified with 1 wt.% of different metal oxides. In the temperature range of 673-823 K, the major products were C3H6, CO and CO 2 . Small amounts of CH4,
C2H
6 and C2H 4 were also produced,especially on
K-
and Cr-doped catalysts.
The selectivity to propylene decreased with increasing propane conversion on all catalysts.

CTemperature of the reduction peak maximum in TPR experiments. 215 VALENZUELA et al.: V-Mg-O CATALYSTS AS follows from this table,the original V-Mg-O catalyst was more active and selective for propane dehydrogenation than all modified samples.
The lowest selectivity to propylene was obtained on a K-doped catalyst. This result is consistent with the previous observation by Kung [8] that mixed V-Mg oxides prepared with the use of K0H showed decreased selectivity in comparison with the same catalysts prepared without the use of
KOH.
Significantly lower activity obtained for the Cr-doped catalyst contradicts the promoting effect of Cr203 in butane oxidation reported in ref. [6]. Taking into account that in the latter work twice as much of Cr203 was incorporated into the V-Mg-O catalyst, we prepared a catalyst which contained I0 wt.% Cr203 .
It also exhibited considerably lower activity and selectivity than the undoped catalyst,thus confirming the deteriorating effect of chromium on the catalytic performance of V-Mg oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
The XRD patterns of original and modified catalysts were similar,showing the presence of only Mg0 diffraction lines.
The presence of Mg orthovanadate or other possible compounds of V-Mg-O was not detected,probably because of their low concentration in the solid.
This is confirmed by the Raman spectra of catalysts shown in Fig. i. The V-Mg-O catalyst,as well as K- and Sm-doped samples,exhibit bands at 861,480,
-I
351,and 276 cm due to the Mg orthovanadate phase [9,10].
This result indicates that the incorporation of small amounts of
K20
or Sm203 did not change significantly the phase composition of the V-Mg-O catalyst.
In the spectrum of the Nb-doped,catalyst,along with the strongest bands of Mg -i orthovanadate at 860 and 350 cm , new bands were observed at 993, 674, 629, and 264 cm -I due to H-Nb205 oxide [ii] . The band -i at 993 cm could be assigned to the presence of supported V205 as well; however,its ether strong bands reported in ref.
[12] were absent.
For the C r-doped catalyst,no Raman spectrum was obtained because of strong fluorescence. 216 VALENZUELA et al.: V-Mg-O CATALYSTS

eV,respectively,which were close to those reported previously for different V-Mg-O catalysts in refs.
[3,4]. From these data, it can be suggested that V 5+ and Mg 2+,but not their reduced species were present at the surface of all the catalysts studied.
The surface V/Mg atomic ratios measured by XPS are listed in Table i. This characteristic was found equal to 0.107 for the undoped catalyst,which is in good agreement with the literature data [1,3].
It is seen also that the addition of potassium or niobium did not affect the surface V/Mg ratio,whereas chromium and samarium remarkably increased it. The XPS M/Mg ratios for Cr-, Sm- and K-doped catalysts were by factors of respectively 5,8 and 20 smaller than the corresponding nominal ratios. Much lower (by i000 times) surface dispersity was found for niobium which, as shown above, was present in the V-Mg-O catalyst as a Nb205 phase. These variations in surface compositions of the catalysts did not show any correlation with either their overall activity or dehydrogenation selectivity.
TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The results show that all samples had only one reduction peak with a maximum'varying in the temperature range of 812-885 K (Table i). Since MgO [i0] and Nb205 [13] do not undergo reduction by hydrogen at these temperatures but V205 [13] does,one may attribute those peaks to the reduction of vanadium ions. It is seen that the undoped catalyst was reduced at lower temperature than the doped samples.The ease of their reduction decreased as follows: VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK. The activity of catalysts decreased in the order VMg > VMgK > VMgNb > VMgCr > VMgSm, and the dehydrogenation selectivity was like VMg > VMgNb VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK.Note that there is no correlation between the activity and reducibility,while the selectivity to propylene follows the order reducibility,i.e., the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective.The same trend was observed by us when comparing the reducibility and catalytic 218 VALENZUELA et al.: V-Mg-O CATALYSTS properties of undoped V-Mg oxides containing different amounts of vanadium [14].The parallelism in changes of the oxydehydrogenation selectivity and catalyst redox properties was reported also for the three Mg vanadates [I0] and Mo-V-Nb oxides [13]. If the catalytic reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle between V 5+ and V4+as suggested in [2,5], a good redox behavior under reaction conditions might be favorable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.The exact mechanism by which catalyst reducibility facilitates only the dehydrogenation reaction remains unknown,and further studies of this point are needed.
