[1] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[2] "Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive."
[3] "Exploitation of such resources is impeded by the high cost of both gas transportation and current methods for converting hydrocarbon gas into more readily transportable liquid."
[4] "The controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules has been a ubiquitous theme in transition metal chemistry since its renaissance began in the late 1950s."
[5] "Binding to metal centres has resulted in altered and/or enhanced reactivity in a variety of molecules, through associated changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity."
[6] "In principle, it should be possible to similarly activate the inert CH bonds of alkanes."
[7] "However, during the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated."
[8] "These observations suggested that alkane activation should be possible."
[9] "Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982 (refs 15, 16) (one reaction is shown in equation (4))."
[10] "This interpretation proved to be correct."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves transforming saturated hydrocarbons into unsaturated ones through oxygen addition and subsequent dehydration. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in this process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise from the difficulty in controlling the reaction pathway, as alkanes are inherently inert due to the strong CC and CH bonds. Catalysts facilitate the activation of the CH bonds, leading to the formation of more reactive intermediates. Site isolation techniques can address selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific regions of the catalyst surface, enhancing the formation of desired products. Reaction mechanisms typically involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by determining the rate of reaction, product distribution, and energy consumption. Optimizing the catalyst properties and operating conditions is essential for improving the overall efficiency of ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及通过氧插入和随后的脱水将饱和烃转化为不饱和烃。各种催化剂，包括体金属氧化物和支持系统，在此过程中起着关键作用。实现高选择性和转化的挑战来自于控制反应路径的困难，因为烷烃由于其强大的CC和CH键而固有地惰性。催化剂促进CH键的活化，导致形成更活泼的中间体。通过隔离技术可以解决选择性问题，通过限制反应仅在催化剂表面特定区域进行，从而增强所需产品的形成。反应机制通常涉及C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-抽象步骤。这些因素共同影响过程效率，决定反应速率、产物分布和能耗。优化催化剂性质和操作条件对于提高ODH过程的整体效率至关重要。
