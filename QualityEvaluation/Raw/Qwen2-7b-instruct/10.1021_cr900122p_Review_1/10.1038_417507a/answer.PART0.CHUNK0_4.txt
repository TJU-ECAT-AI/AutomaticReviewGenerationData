<p>The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert. This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxy- genates such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons. The primary unsaturated starting materials are olefins, in turn obtained from alkanes by fairly inefficient processes.</p>
<p>In fact, the recent development of promising catalytic systems highlights the potential of organometallic chemistry for useful CH bond activation strategies that will ultimately allow us to exploit Earth’s alkane resources more efficiently and cleanly.</p>
<p>If such assistance were in fact required, activation of aliphatic C H bonds at transition-metal centres would not be a good strategy for catalytic alkane conversion.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated. For example, some metal complexes were known to catalyse alkane reactions such as hydrogendeuterium (HD) exchange or oxidation under relatively mild conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, several cases of so-called agostic bonding were discovered, wherein a CH bond of an already coordinated ligand forms an additional bond to the metal (see Fig. 1 for a typical example).</p>
<p>These observations suggested that alkane activation should be possible. In fact, chemists realized that previous failures to achieve it might not have been due to unreactivity at all: CH activation might take place, but yield an organometallic product that is thermodynamically unstable and thus undetectable.</p>
<p>Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982 (refs 15, 16) (one reaction is shown in equation (4)), and a large number of other examples quickly followed.</p>

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we find that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are closely tied to the efficiency of catalysts. Catalysts can facilitate the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation is proposed as a solution to address selectivity issues, enhancing the process's overall efficiency. These factors collectively influence the ODH process by improving the catalyst's activity, stability, and selectivity. The role of catalysts in the ODH process is pivotal, as they enable the selective transformation of alkanes into valuable oxygenates, thereby optimizing the utilization of alkane resources.
