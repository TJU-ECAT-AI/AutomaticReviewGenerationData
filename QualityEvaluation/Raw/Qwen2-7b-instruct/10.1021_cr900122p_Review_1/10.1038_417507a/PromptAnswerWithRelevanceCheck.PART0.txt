1. Alkanes react at high temperatures during combustion, but these reactions are not easily controllable and typically lead to stable, economically unappealing products like carbon dioxide and water. Cracking and thermal dehydrogenation processes convert alkanes into valuable olefins but require high temperatures and are energy-intensive. Exposure to superacids or free radicals can induce reactions in alkanes, but these reactive species are costly and offer limited control over product selectivity.
   
2. The direct conversion of methane into methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could greatly enhance the utilization of methane resources. Transition metal chemistry, particularly the activation of small, inert molecules, offers potential for alkane conversion.

3. While small molecules like olefins and carbon monoxide become more reactive upon coordination to a metal center, alkanes lack the necessary electron pairs or p orbitals to interact effectively with metal centers. However, during the 1970s, significant interactions between metal centers and alkane CH bonds suggested that alkane activation might be possible.

4. In 1982, two research groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation using systems that produced stable products. This marked a significant advancement in the field of alkane conversion.

5. The ability to activate the inert CH bonds of alkanes through transition metal complexes holds promise for catalytic alkane conversion. The controlled activation of small, inert molecules is a well-established theme in transition metal chemistry, suggesting potential for effective alkane conversion techniques.

1. 燃烧时，烷烃会反应，但这些反应不易控制，通常产生二氧化碳和水等经济上不吸引人的稳定产物。裂解和热脱氢化过程将烷烃转化为有价值的烯烃，但需要高温且耗能高。通过超酸或自由基暴露可以诱导烷烃反应，但这些活性物种成本高昂，且对产品选择性控制有限。

2. 直接将甲烷转化为甲醇或其他液体燃料或化学物质可以显著提高甲烷的利用效率。过渡金属化学，尤其是小分子的可控活化，为烷烃转换提供了潜力。

3. 尽管像烯烃和一氧化碳这样的小分子在与金属中心配位后变得更具反应性，但烷烃缺乏必要的电子对或p轨道与金属中心有效互动。然而，在20世纪70年代，金属中心和烷烃CH键之间的显著相互作用表明，烷烃活化可能是可能的。

4. 1982年，两个研究小组使用产生稳定产品的系统证明了分子间烷烃激活。这是烷烃转换领域的一个重大进展。

5. 通过过渡金属复合物激活烷烃中的惰性CH键有可能实现催化烷烃转换。过渡金属化学中对小分子的可控活化是一个普遍主题，这暗示了有效的烷烃转换技术潜力。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion due to the inert nature of alkanes. The inertness arises from strong and localized CC and CH bonds, which prevent alkanes from participating in chemical reactions easily. High-temperature reactions, such as combustion, are not controllable and typically lead to thermodynamically stable products like carbon dioxide and water. The lack of readily available empty orbitals or filled orbitals with high energy hinders the activation of CH bonds in alkanes. However, the controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules, including alkanes, has been a focus in transition metal chemistry. In the 1970s, interactions between metal centers and alkane CH bonds suggested that the difficulties in activation might have been overstated. Since then, methods for intermolecular alkane activation have been developed, demonstrating the potential for catalytic alkane conversion.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）面临高选择性和转化率难以达到的问题，这是由于烷烃的惰性所致。这种惰性来源于强且局部化的CC和CH键，使得烷烃难以参与化学反应。高温反应，如燃烧，不可控，并通常导致热力学稳定的产品，如二氧化碳和水。缺乏易于获取的空轨道或高能级充满的轨道阻碍了烷烃中CH键的激活。然而，对小型、相对惰性分子（包括烷烃）的可控活化一直是过渡金属化学的主题。在1970年代，金属中心与烷烃CH键之间的相互作用表明，可能低估了激活的难度。自那时以来，已经开发出了分子间烷烃激活的方法，证明了催化烷烃转换的可能性。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves transforming saturated hydrocarbons into unsaturated ones through oxygen addition and subsequent dehydration. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in this process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise from the difficulty in controlling the reaction pathway, as alkanes are inherently inert due to the strong CC and CH bonds. Catalysts facilitate the activation of the CH bonds, leading to the formation of more reactive intermediates. Site isolation techniques can address selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific regions of the catalyst surface, enhancing the formation of desired products. Reaction mechanisms typically involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by determining the rate of reaction, product distribution, and energy consumption. Optimizing the catalyst properties and operating conditions is essential for improving the overall efficiency of ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及通过氧插入和随后的脱水将饱和烃转化为不饱和烃。各种催化剂，包括体金属氧化物和支持系统，在此过程中起着关键作用。实现高选择性和转化的挑战来自于控制反应路径的困难，因为烷烃由于其强大的CC和CH键而固有地惰性。催化剂促进CH键的活化，导致形成更活泼的中间体。通过隔离技术可以解决选择性问题，通过限制反应仅在催化剂表面特定区域进行，从而增强所需产品的形成。反应机制通常涉及C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-抽象步骤。这些因素共同影响过程效率，决定反应速率、产物分布和能耗。优化催化剂性质和操作条件对于提高ODH过程的整体效率至关重要。

<p>The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert.</p>
<p>This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion under such benign conditions is possible in principle.</p>
<p>However, because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygens such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>In principle, it should be possible to similarly activate the inert CH bonds of alkanes, but the examples just mentioned all involve small molecules with lone electron pairs and/or p orbitals that can interact with empty orbitals of the metal centres; alkanes possess neither of these.</p>
<p>Indeed, in most pre-1980s examples of CH bonds reacting at transition-metal centres, reactions proceed successfully only if they are assisted through participation of the p orbitals of aromatic CH bonds or involve intramolecular reactions, where the group containing the CH bond to be activated is already attached to the metal.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated.</p>
<p>For example, some metal complexes were known to catalyse alkane reactions such as hydrogendeuterium (HD) exchange or oxidation under relatively mild conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, several cases of so-called agostic bonding were discovered, wherein a CH bond of an already coordinated ligand forms an additional bond to the metal.</p>
<p>These observations suggested that alkane activation should be possible.</p>
<p>Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982.</p>
<p>Chemists realized that previous failures to achieve it might not have been due to unreactivity at all: CH activation might take place, but yield an organometallic product that is thermodynamically unstable and thus undetectable.</p>
<p>This interpretation proved to be correct. Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a large number of other examples quickly followed.</p>

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we find that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are closely tied to the efficiency of catalysts. Catalysts can facilitate the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation is proposed as a solution to address selectivity issues, enhancing the process's overall efficiency. These factors collectively influence the ODH process by improving the catalyst's activity, stability, and selectivity. The role of catalysts in the ODH process is pivotal, as they enable the selective transformation of alkanes into valuable oxygenates, thereby optimizing the utilization of alkane resources.
