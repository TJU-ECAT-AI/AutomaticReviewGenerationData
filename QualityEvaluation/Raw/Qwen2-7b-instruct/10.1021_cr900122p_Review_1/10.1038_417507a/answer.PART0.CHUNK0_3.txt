<p>The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert.</p>
<p>This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion under such benign conditions is possible in principle.</p>
<p>However, because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygens such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>In principle, it should be possible to similarly activate the inert CH bonds of alkanes, but the examples just mentioned all involve small molecules with lone electron pairs and/or p orbitals that can interact with empty orbitals of the metal centres; alkanes possess neither of these.</p>
<p>Indeed, in most pre-1980s examples of CH bonds reacting at transition-metal centres, reactions proceed successfully only if they are assisted through participation of the p orbitals of aromatic CH bonds or involve intramolecular reactions, where the group containing the CH bond to be activated is already attached to the metal.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated.</p>
<p>For example, some metal complexes were known to catalyse alkane reactions such as hydrogendeuterium (HD) exchange or oxidation under relatively mild conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, several cases of so-called agostic bonding were discovered, wherein a CH bond of an already coordinated ligand forms an additional bond to the metal.</p>
<p>These observations suggested that alkane activation should be possible.</p>
<p>Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982.</p>
<p>Chemists realized that previous failures to achieve it might not have been due to unreactivity at all: CH activation might take place, but yield an organometallic product that is thermodynamically unstable and thus undetectable.</p>
<p>This interpretation proved to be correct. Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a large number of other examples quickly followed.</p>

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
