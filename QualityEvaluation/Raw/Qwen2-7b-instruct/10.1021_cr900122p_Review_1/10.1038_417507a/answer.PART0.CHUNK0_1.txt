[1] "The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert."
[2] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[3] "Although profitable practical applications have not yet been developed, our understanding of how these organometallic reactions occur, and what their inherent advantages and limitations for practical alkane conversion are, has progressed considerably."
[4] "The controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules has been a ubiquitous theme in transition metal chemistry since its renaissance began in the late 1950s."
[5] "In principle, it should be possible to similarly activate the inert CH bonds of alkanes, but the examples just mentioned all involve small molecules with lone electron pairs and/or p orbitals that can interact with empty orbitals of the metal centres; alkanes possess neither of these."
[6] "During the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated."
[7] "Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982 (refs 15, 16) (one reaction is shown in equation (4)), and a large number of other examples quickly followed."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion due to the inert nature of alkanes. The inertness arises from strong and localized CC and CH bonds, which prevent alkanes from participating in chemical reactions easily. High-temperature reactions, such as combustion, are not controllable and typically lead to thermodynamically stable products like carbon dioxide and water. The lack of readily available empty orbitals or filled orbitals with high energy hinders the activation of CH bonds in alkanes. However, the controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules, including alkanes, has been a focus in transition metal chemistry. In the 1970s, interactions between metal centers and alkane CH bonds suggested that the difficulties in activation might have been overstated. Since then, methods for intermolecular alkane activation have been developed, demonstrating the potential for catalytic alkane conversion.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）面临高选择性和转化率难以达到的问题，这是由于烷烃的惰性所致。这种惰性来源于强且局部化的CC和CH键，使得烷烃难以参与化学反应。高温反应，如燃烧，不可控，并通常导致热力学稳定的产品，如二氧化碳和水。缺乏易于获取的空轨道或高能级充满的轨道阻碍了烷烃中CH键的激活。然而，对小型、相对惰性分子（包括烷烃）的可控活化一直是过渡金属化学的主题。在1970年代，金属中心与烷烃CH键之间的相互作用表明，可能低估了激活的难度。自那时以来，已经开发出了分子间烷烃激活的方法，证明了催化烷烃转换的可能性。
