[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has a considerable industrial impact because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "The dehydrogenation activity is proportional with the amount of in situ measured surface Cr, and maximum for a 7.5 wt.% CrAl₂O₃ catalyst operating at 500°C in 2% isobutane in N₂."
[3] "Cr-sites are more active in alkane dehydrogenation than Cr₂q-sites."
[4] "It is important to stress that this technique has been successfully introduced in the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals design, but to our best knowledge, not in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."
[5] "The influence of the different design variables or factors (reaction time and temperature, gas composition, support composition, and Cr-loading) on the response y (dehydrogenation activity) could be determined by applying a statistical model based on multiple linear regression MLR."
[6] "In order to visualize Eq. 2, one can make conversion surface plots, as illustrated in Fig. 3."
[7] "The dehydrogenation activity gradually increases with increasing Cr loading and decreasing amount of isobutane in N₂."
[8] "The combined effect of the IEP of the support and the reaction temperature on the catalytic activity is given in Fig. 3C."
[9] "The IEP of the support seems to be a good measure to differentiate between the different support compositions."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature discusses the role of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the need for efficient C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the reaction occurs selectively at specific sites on the catalyst. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between these factors. The site isolation strategy helps to direct the reaction towards the desired product, thereby enhancing the overall process efficiency. The literature suggests that the IEP of the support acts as an effective measure to differentiate between different support compositions, indicating its potential significance in catalyst design and optimization.
