[1] "In 1979, Crabtree demonstrated the dehyrogenation of alkanes using a stoichiometic amount of an iridium- phosphine complex."
[2] "The first example with respect to the catalytic dehydrogenation of an alkane under thermal conditions was reported by Baudry using a homogeneous rhenium catalyst."
[3] "Crabtree re-examined their previously reported reactions and found that the dehydrogenation of cyclooctane takes place in a catalytic manner."
[4] "Other types of thermal catalytic alkane dehydrogenation using a hydrogen acceptor have been reported by several research groups."
[5] "In 1990, Saito reported an extremely interesting result. Their finding was that the endoergonic alkane dehydrogenation reactions can be driven by the continuous removal of molecular hydrogen in the refluxing process."
[6] "A notable advance has recently been achieved in the acceptor-less dehydrogenation of alkanes. The transition metal-catalyzed highly efficient alkane dehydrogenation proceeds, even in the absence of a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, under thermal conditions."
[7] "Hall predicted that the acceptor-less dehydrogenation of alkanes using [3-2,6-(R2PCH2)2C6H3]IrH2 proceeds associatively, specifically via the CH oxidative addition of the (RPCP)IrH2 (Figure 4, right panel)."
[8] "Goldman concluded that the dehydrogenation reaction takes place via the dissociation of dihydrogen from (RPCP)IrH2, leading to the (RPCP)Ir (Figure 4, left panel)."
