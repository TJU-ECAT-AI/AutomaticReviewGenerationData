1. Over the past 40 years, the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds, known as CH bond activation, has been a captivating research topic primarily for inorganic and organometallic chemists. 

2. In 1963, Kleiman and Dubeck documented the potential for cleaving CH bonds within azobenzene utilizing the Cp2Ni complex, as illustrated in Equation (1).

3. Following these pioneering discoveries, numerous research teams have explored the cleavage of CH bonds employing a stoichiometric quantity of transition metal complexes.

4. A crucial step in these reactions involves the generation of metal-carbon bonds through oxidative addition of the CX bond (where X represents halogen or triflate) to low-valent transition metal complexes.

5. Should CH bonds be utilized similarly to carbon-halogen bonds for creating a carbon-carbon (CC) bond, the reaction transforms into one of the most valuable, potent, and straightforward methodologies in organic synthesis.

1. 在过去的40年中，碳-氢（CH）键的断裂，即CH键活化，一直是无机化学和配位金属化学家主要关注的有趣研究主题。

2. 1963年，Kleiman和Dubeck报道了在aza苯环中通过Cp2Ni复合物可能进行CH键裂解，并用方程式（1）进行了说明。

3. 随后，许多研究团队探索了通过使用等摩尔量的过渡金属复合物进行CH键裂解。

4. 这些反应的关键步骤是通过氧化添加CX键（其中X代表卤素或三氟甲磺酸盐）到低价过渡金属复合物来生成金属-碳键。

5. 如果能够利用CH键像碳-卤素键一样构建CC键，那么该反应将转变为最具有价值、强大且简便的有机合成方法之一。
