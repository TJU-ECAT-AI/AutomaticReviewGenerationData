Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts have been explored to enhance the process. Crabtree demonstrated the use of a stoichiometric amount of an iridium-phosphine complex for alkane dehydrogenation in 1979. Among different iridium complexes, the iridium polyhydride complex with isopropylphosphine exhibited the highest catalytic activity, achieving 23 turnovers per hour. This indicates the effectiveness of such catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation, where the substrate and hydrogen acceptor can be the same compound, such as cyclohexenes.

Under photo-irradiation conditions, the reaction of pentane with B2pin2 using Cp*Re(CO)3 catalyst led to carbon-boryl (CB) bond formation exclusively at the methyl CH bond. This highlights the specificity of the catalyst in targeting specific alkane functional groups. 

Recently, Ishiyama's findings revealed that the presence of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) significantly improved the activity of the iridium catalyst in the coupling of aromatic CH bonds with Bpin2. This suggests that the anion ligand on the iridium center plays a crucial role in enhancing the reactivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

These factors collectively influence the process efficiency of ODH by affecting the selectivity, conversion, and speed of the reaction. Site isolation might be a strategy to address selectivity issues by preventing unwanted side reactions or directing the reaction towards specific functional groups.

分析氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH），已探索各种催化剂以提高该过程。Crabtree于1979年展示了使用等摩尔量的铱-磷复合物对烷烃进行脱氢。在不同的铱复合物中，具有异丙基磷的铱聚氢化物显示出最高的催化活性，每小时达到23个转数。这表明此类催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的有效性，其中基质和氢接受体可以是同一化合物，例如环己烯。

在光照射条件下，五烷与B2pin2通过Cp*Re(CO)3催化剂的反应导致碳硼（CB）键仅在甲基CH键上形成。这强调了催化剂在针对特定烷烃功能团的特异性。 

最近，Ishiyama的研究发现，存在4,4-二叔丁基-2,2-吡啶（dtbpy）显著提高了铱催化剂在芳香族CH键与Bpin2耦合中的活性。这表明铱中心上的阴离子配体在增强催化剂活性和效率方面起着关键作用。

这些因素共同影响ODH过程的效率，影响选择性、转化率和反应速度。位点隔离可能是一种策略来解决选择性问题，通过防止意外副反应或引导反应向特定功能团定向。
