Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization: Application in Organic Synthesis Fumitoshi Kakiuchi*, Naoto Chatani Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan Fax:  81-6-6879-7396, e-mail: kakiuchi@chem.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp Received: May 12, 2003; Accepted: July 17, 2003 Abstract: The development of catalytic reactions involving carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage is currently one of the most attractive research subjects in organic and organometallic chemistry. 

In 1963, Kleiman and Dubeck reported the possibility of CH bond cleavage in azobenzene by the Cp2Ni complex, Eq. (1). The reaction mechanism for this metalation reaction has not been elucidated, but the ortho-CH bond was apparently cleaved.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the selection of catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the difficulty in controlling the reaction pathway and intermediate stability. Catalysts such as bulk metal oxides might offer high conversion rates but suffer from low selectivity. Supported systems, on the other hand, can improve selectivity but may face issues with catalyst loading and stability. 

The role of site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By confining the reaction to specific sites within the catalyst, researchers can enhance the selectivity towards desired products. This is particularly relevant in ODH, where the orientation of the alkane molecule relative to the catalyst surface can significantly impact the reaction outcome.

Proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. C-H bond activation involves the breaking of a C-H bond through the introduction of a metal center, leading to the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes abstraction of a hydrogen atom, resulting in the formation of an alkene. The selectivity and efficiency of the ODH process are influenced by the ability of the catalyst to effectively activate the C-H bond and control the subsequent abstraction step. 

The interplay between catalyst design, reaction conditions, and the proposed mechanisms collectively determines the process efficiency. Optimizing these factors can lead to improvements in both selectivity and conversion rates. For instance, the use of supported catalysts with precise site isolation can enhance selectivity while maintaining high conversion levels. Additionally, the development of novel catalysts with tailored properties can further refine the ODH process, making it more efficient and versatile for industrial applications.

催化方法中涉及碳-氢键断裂的发展目前是有机化学和配位金属化学领域最吸引人的研究主题之一。1963年，克莱曼和杜贝克报告了在环辛二烯配合物下，苯基偶氮苯中的CH键可能被裂解的可能性，式（1）。该金属化反应的机制尚未阐明，但推测是通过裂解对位的CH键实现的。

氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）受到催化剂选择的影响，包括体金属氧化物和负载系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通常源于控制反应途径和中间体稳定性的困难。体金属氧化物可能提供高的转化率，但选择性低。负载系统可以提高选择性，但可能面临催化剂负载和稳定性的问题。

隔离反应位点在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过将反应限制在催化剂表面的特定位点内，研究人员可以增强目标产物的选择性。这对于ODH尤为重要，在这种情况下，烷烃分子相对于催化剂表面的定向会显著影响反应结果。

提出的反应机理包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H摘除。C-H键活化涉及通过引入金属中心来裂解C-H键，从而生成烷基金属中间体。然后，中间体进行氢原子摘除，形成烯烃。选择性和效率的ODH过程受催化剂有效激活C-H键并控制后续摘除步骤的能力的影响。

催化剂设计、反应条件和提出机制之间的相互作用共同决定了过程效率。优化这些因素可以导致选择性和转化率的改进。例如，使用具有精确位点隔离的负载催化剂可以增强选择性同时保持高转化水平。此外，开发具有定制属性的新催化剂可以进一步精炼ODH过程，使其更适合工业应用。
