[1] "With a C-H (first) bond energy of 104 kcaYmole and a weak interaction with most surfaces that is dominated by dispersion forces, methane seems to be the most diffi- cult molecule among all organic substances to activate."
[2] "Nevertheless, when it is re-acted with water (steam reforming) over nickel catalysts it dehydrogenates com- pletely to produce CO and Hz by an endo- thermic process (I)."
[3] "The purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility of partial oxidation of meth- ane under atmospheric pressure conditions."
[4] "The observation by Liu et al. (4, 5) indi- cated that partial oxidation could be achieved under 1 atm pressure by the use of nitrous oxide as the oxidant and water va- por in the gas stream over a Mo03-SiOz catalyst."
[5] "The methane-to-methanol conversion is a thermodynamically favorable process and in light of the successes obtained with the partial oxidation of other small molecules,ethylene and propylene, the production of methanol from methane deserves serious experimental scrutiny."
[6] "The rate of methanol formation was first order with respect to methane and water, and zero order with respect to nitrous oxide; whereas the rate of formaldehyde formation was zero order with respect to all reactants."
[7] "The threshold temperature for CO forma- tion is apparently 570C. However, it is possible that at the low overall conversions small amounts of CO that formed at lower temperatures escaped detection by the rela- tively less sensitive thermal conductivity detector."
[8] "Based on these findings, all kinetic measurements were carried out by keeping the contact time unchanged at a value of 2.3 s. and measuring the rates of formation of CH3OH and HCHO directly as described earlier."
[9] "Whether these declines in activities were due to poisoning or loss of Moo3 through volatilization is not clear at present."
[10] "In view of the enhancement of CHjOH selectivity by HzO, the possibilities of steam reforming of CH4 to CO and HZ, water-gas shift reaction of CO and Hz0 to produce Hz and the hy- drogenation of CO were all investigated through probe reactions."
[11] "The data qualitatively fits the above reac- tion scheme that is presented in Fig. 7 if we assume that among the five elementary processes specified, steps two and four have lower rate constants, i.e., kz,kd Q k3,k5."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts plays a significant role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are key catalyst types in this process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the nature of alkane molecules and the difficulty in activating their C-H bonds, especially methane. The weak interaction of methane with most surfaces, dominated by dispersion forces, makes it particularly challenging. The use of water vapor and nitrous oxide as oxidants and reducing agents, respectively, under atmospheric pressure conditions facilitates the partial oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde. The selectivity and conversion are influenced by the reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues, as it helps to ensure that the reaction proceeds efficiently without unwanted side reactions.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by factors including catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the interplay between various chemical steps. The role of site isolation is pivotal in maintaining high selectivity by preventing the formation of undesired byproducts. Understanding the composition and oxidation state of the active catalyst surface, as well as identifying potential reaction intermediates like surface methoxy and hydroxyl species, can further enhance the process efficiency and selectivity.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，各种催化剂之间的相互作用在实现高选择性和转化率方面起着关键作用。块状金属氧化物和负载型系统是这一过程中至关重要的催化剂类型。在实现高选择性和转化率时，烷烃分子的性质以及激活其C-H键的难度成为挑战。甲烷与大多数表面之间弱的相互作用，主要由范德华力主导，使得其特别难以激活。使用水蒸气和亚硝酸作为氧化剂和还原剂，在大气压条件下促进了甲烷的部分氧化为甲醇和甲醛。选择性和转化率受反应机制的影响，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H抽取。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中至关重要，因为它有助于确保反应以高效的方式进行，而不会产生不希望的副产品。

ODH过程的效率受到催化剂类型、反应条件以及各种化学步骤之间相互作用的共同影响。位点隔离的作用对于保持高选择性至关重要，防止形成不希望的副产物。理解催化剂表面的组成和氧化状态，以及识别可能的反应中间体，如表面甲氧基和羟基物种，可以进一步提高过程效率和选择性。
