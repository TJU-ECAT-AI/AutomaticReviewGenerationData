[1] "With a C-H (first) bond energy of 104 kcaYmole and a weak interaction with most surfaces that is dominated by dispersion forces, methane seems to be the most diffi- cult molecule among all organic substances to activate."
[2] "Nevertheless, when it is re-acted with water (steam reforming) over nickel catalysts it dehydrogenates com- pletely to produce CO and Hz by an endo- thermic process (I)."
[3] "It would be of considerable importance if the partial oxi- dation of methane to methanol with the in- sertion of an oxygen atom could be carried out."
[4] "This appears to be a difficult reaction while the further partial oxidation of metha- nol to formaldehyde is a facile step and a well-researched industrial process (2, 3)."
[5] "The purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility of partial oxidation of meth- ane under atmospheric pressure conditions."
[6] "By using a set of experimental conditions identical to theirs we were able to reproduce their observations regarding conversion and selectivity at various tem- peratures ."
[7] "The methane-to-methanol conversion is a thermodynamically favorable process and in light of the successes obtained with the partial oxidation of other small molecules,ethylene and propylene, the production of methanol from methane deserves serious experimental scrutiny."
[8] "The present study was carried out under conditions very similar to that re-ported by Liu et al. (4, 5)."
[9] "The most plausible reaction scheme, as far as can be inferred from the above data,is summarized in Fig. 7."
[10] "Likewise, for HCHO at and above 540C where there is an appreciable buildup of CH30H and its conversion to HCHO, one could formulate d[HCHOl dt = fi
LCH41
+ kKHjOH1."
