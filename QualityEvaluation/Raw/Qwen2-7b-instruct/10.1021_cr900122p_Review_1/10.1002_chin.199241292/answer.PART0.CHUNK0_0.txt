Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we see that the process involves the selective formation of alkylbenzenes from the reaction of benzene with an alkane. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are essential in ODH processes. High selectivity and conversion are major challenges, necessitating the development of new catalysts and reaction conditions. Proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation techniques are used to address selectivity issues by managing the reaction pathways. The overall efficiency of the process is affected by the interaction among catalyst characteristics, reaction conditions, and the selectivity of the desired products.
