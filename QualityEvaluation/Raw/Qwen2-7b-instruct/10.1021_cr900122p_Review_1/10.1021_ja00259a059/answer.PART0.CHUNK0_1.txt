Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the complex interactions between different catalyst types, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include managing the balance between efficient C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction processes. These mechanisms are crucial for optimizing the reaction pathways, enhancing process efficiency, and mitigating unwanted side reactions. Site isolation plays a pivotal role in addressing selectivity issues by providing a controlled environment where specific reactions can proceed selectively without interference from competing pathways. This approach helps in maximizing the yield of desired products while minimizing the formation of byproducts.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及到不同催化剂类型（包括体相金属氧化物和负载系统）之间的复杂相互作用。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括管理有效的C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体形成和2H-摘除过程的平衡。这些机制对于优化反应途径、提高过程效率并减少副反应至关重要。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中扮演着关键角色，通过提供一个可控环境，在该环境中可以进行选择性反应而不会受到竞争路径的干扰。这种方法有助于最大化目标产物的产率，同时减少副产品的生成。
