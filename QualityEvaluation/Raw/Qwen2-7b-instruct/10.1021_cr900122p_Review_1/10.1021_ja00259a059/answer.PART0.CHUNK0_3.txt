Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) reveals the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to competing pathways. Mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction are fundamental to the reaction process. Site isolation strategies have been implemented to enhance selectivity by confining the reaction to specific catalyst sites. These factors collectively influence the overall efficiency of the process, which is further modulated by the choice of catalyst, operational conditions, and reaction mechanisms.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）表明，各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统，在其复杂性中起着关键作用。由于竞争路径的存在，实现高选择性和转化率仍然是一个挑战。机制如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H摘除在反应过程中起着核心作用。通过隔离位点策略来增强选择性，限制反应仅在特定催化剂位点进行。这些因素共同影响过程的整体效率，该效率进一步受到催化剂的选择、操作条件和反应机制的影响。
