Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe that the effectiveness of the process is greatly influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving both high selectivity and conversion rates poses significant challenges due to the intricate nature of the reaction pathways involved. Key mechanisms driving the ODH process include C-H bond activation, the creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms (2H-abstraction). These mechanisms collectively impact the overall efficiency of the process by affecting the speed of the reaction, the specificity towards the desired product, and the total yield obtained. To address selectivity issues, the concept of site isolation within the catalyst structure is employed. This technique confines reactive intermediates to specific locations, thereby minimizing unwanted side reactions and enhancing the selectivity of the process.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，我们发现各种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）之间的相互作用对过程至关重要。实现高选择性和转化率带来了重大挑战，这归因于反应途径的复杂性。ODH过程的关键机制包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和两个氢原子（2H-摘取）。这些机制共同影响过程的整体效率，通过影响反应速度、目标产物的特异性以及总产量。为了应对选择性问题，采用位点隔离技术在催化剂结构中。这种技术将活性中间体限制在特定位置，从而减少不必要的副反应并增强过程的选择性。
