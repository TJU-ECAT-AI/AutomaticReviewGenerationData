Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) reveals the importance of utilizing various catalyst types, both in bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion rates presents significant challenges, necessitating a deep understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms and catalyst optimization strategies. Efficiency in ODH processes is contingent upon the successful activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation is pivotal in mitigating selectivity issues by directing the reaction towards the desired pathways.
