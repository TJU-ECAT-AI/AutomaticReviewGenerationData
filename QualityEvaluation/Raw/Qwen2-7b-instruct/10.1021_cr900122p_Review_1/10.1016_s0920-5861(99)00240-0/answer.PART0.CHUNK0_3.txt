<p>Several potential sorbent candidates were chosen, based on a desire to obtain high SOx uptakes per weight of catalyst employed.</p>
<p>Conditions chosen for this screening applications are 1200F and 3500 GHSV, with a feed containing 1% SO2, 4% O2, and 10% H2O, with nitrogen as diluent.</p>
<p>Utilizing these conditions, catalyst sulfation was terminated when the effluent SO2 concentration exceeded 250 ppmv.</p>
<p>A typical SO2 concentration profile during adsorption is shown in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>Clearly, bypassing is negligible in this system.</p>
<p>Further, the shape of this curve is consistent with a bandwise sorption process.</p>
<p>Measured SOx uptakes utilizing the procedure described above are listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>The entries in Table 1 illustrate two critical factors in catalyst selection - that both, effective oxidation promoters and a high-capacity basic sorption site, such as magnesium oxide based sites in magnesium aluminate spinel, are essential for high SOx uptake capacity.</p>
<p>Comparing entries 2, 3, and 4 illustrate that, with ceria as oxidation promoter, SOx uptake increases with magnesium content - from 7 wt% uptake for CeO2/Al2O3, to 20% for CeO2/MgAl2O4 and 25% for CeO2/Mg2Al2O5.</p>
<p>Like-wise, comparing entries 4, 6, and 7 illustrate that utilizing the same magnesium aluminate spinel base, more effective oxidation promoters, such as platinum and combinations of vanadia and ceria, are more effective than ceria alone.</p>
<p>As entry 1 illustrates, the lack of an oxidation promoter leads to very low SOx uptakes - only 5 wt% uptake is noted for Mg2Al2O5.</p>
<p>The reduction step can yield SO2, Sn (n = 18), or H2S as the sulfur-containing products of desorption.</p>

<p>The overall process can be operated in fixed swing-bed reactors, a fluid-bed reactor, or moving beds.</p>
<p>At the start of this experiment, the SOx uptake was 58 wt%, and following 210 cycles, the uptake was 42 wt%, which is commercially acceptable.</p>

The oxidative sorption of sulfur oxides involves several factors, including catalyst selection and reaction conditions. High SOx uptakes per weight of catalyst are desired, and the screening process selects catalysts based on conditions such as 1200F, 3500 GHSV, 1% SO2, 4% O2, 10% H2O, and nitrogen as diluent. The process aims to terminate catalyst sulfation when the effluent SO2 concentration exceeds 250 ppmv. The shape of the SO2 concentration profile during adsorption indicates a bandwise sorption process. High SOx uptakes are achieved by using effective oxidation promoters and high-capacity basic sorption sites, such as magnesium oxide sites in magnesium aluminate spinel. Platinum and combinations of vanadia and ceria as oxidation promoters show higher effectiveness compared to ceria alone. The reduction step yields SO2, Sn, or H2S as sulfur-containing products. The process can operate in various configurations, such as fixed swing-bed reactors, fluid-bed reactors, or moving beds. The catalyst demonstrates commercial acceptability after cycling through 210 cycles, with an SOx uptake of 58 wt% initially and 42 wt% after 210 cycles.

氧化硫吸附涉及多个因素，包括催化剂选择和反应条件。每单位催化剂的高SOx吸收量是所需的目标，筛选过程基于1200F、3500 GHSV、1% SO2、4% O2、10% H2O和氮气作为稀释剂的条件来选择催化剂。该过程旨在在出口SO2浓度超过250 ppmv时终止催化剂硫化。吸附过程中SO2浓度曲线的形状表明了带状吸附过程。通过使用有效的氧化促进剂和高容量的基本吸附位点（如镁铝酸盐中的镁氧化物位点）可以实现高SOx吸收能力。铂以及三氧化二铈和氧化钒的组合作为氧化促进剂比单独的三氧化二铈更有效。还原步骤产生SO2、Sn或H2S作为含硫产物。该过程可以在固定摇摆床反应器、流化床反应器或移动床中运行。催化剂经过210个周期循环后仍具有商业可接受性，初始SOx吸收率为58 wt%，210个周期后为42 wt%。
