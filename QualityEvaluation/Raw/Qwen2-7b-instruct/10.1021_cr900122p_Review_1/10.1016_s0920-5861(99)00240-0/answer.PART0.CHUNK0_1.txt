The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment Process (MOST) is a novel process for reducing sulfur emissions from refinery tailgas to very low levels. It involves three main steps: combustion of sulfur species to convert them into SO2/SO3, adsorption of SOx onto a high-capacity sorbent, and reductive desorption of sulfur as a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S.

The process utilizes a regenerable promoted spinel-based sorbent with high SOx uptake capacities, offering operational benefits over conventional wet scrubbing processes. The sorbent has very high SOx uptake capacities, and the process is robust and operationally simple.

The catalyst selection for the oxidative sorption step includes high surface area alumina and magnesium aluminate spinels with ceria, vanadia, and/or platinum as oxidation promoters. Ceria as an oxidation promoter shows increasing SOx uptake with magnesium content, while platinum and vanadia/ceria combinations are more effective than ceria alone.

The regeneration of the sulfated sorbent is accomplished using reducing gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen sulfide. The primary product of hydrogen reduction is H2S, which reacts further with the sulfated sorbent to desorb Sn and H2S.

The overall process can be operated in fixed swing-bed reactors, fluid-bed reactors, or moving beds, depending on the application. The process is efficient and capable of achieving very low sulfur emissions, making it suitable for various applications beyond Claus tailgas treatment.

Mobil Oil SOx处理过程（MOST）是一种用于降低炼油厂尾气中硫排放的新颖工艺，将其降至极低水平。该流程涉及三个主要步骤：燃烧硫化物将它们转化为SO2/SO3，SOx吸附到高容量吸附剂上，以及还原性脱硫，形成主要为SO2和H2S的浓缩流体。

该过程使用可再生的促进型尖晶石基吸附剂，具有非常高的SOx吸收能力，提供与传统湿式清洗过程相比的优势。吸附剂具有非常高的SOx吸收能力，并且流程既稳健又易于操作。

氧化吸附步骤的催化剂选择包括高表面积的氧化铝和镁铝尖晶石，其中铈、钒和/或铂作为氧化促进剂。铈作为氧化促进剂显示随镁含量增加SOx吸收量增加，而铂和铈/钒组合比仅使用铈更有效。

硫化吸附剂的再生使用氢、一氧化碳、烃类和氢硫酸等还原气体。氢还原的主要产物是H2S，该物质进一步与硫化吸附剂反应以释放Sn和H2S。

整个流程可以运行在固定摆动床反应器、流化床反应器或移动床中，具体取决于应用。流程高效，能够实现非常低的硫排放，适用于多种应用，远超出克劳斯尾气处理。
