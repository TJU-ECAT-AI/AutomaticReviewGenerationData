[1] "Growing concerns about the environmental impact of sulfur emissions from stationary sources, as well as recent regulatory initiatives, have prompted investigations for advanced sulfur reduction strategies."
[2] "The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment Process (MOST) consists of the following steps: (1) combustion of tailgas sulfur species to convert all sulfur species to SO2/SO3; (2) adsorption of SOx onto a high-capacity sorbent; and (3) in a separate step, reductive desorption of the sulfur as a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S."
[3] "The process can be operated in fixed swing-bed reactors, a fluid-bed reactor, or moving beds."
[4] "At the start of this experiment, the SOx uptake was 58 wt%, and following 210 cycles, the uptake was 42 wt%, which is commercially acceptable."

1. Environmental concerns and new regulations have led to the development of advanced sulfur reduction techniques.
2. The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment Process (MOST) involves converting sulfur species to SO2/SO3, adsorbing them onto a high-capacity sorbent, and then desorbing sulfur as a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S.
3. The process can be implemented using different reactor configurations, such as fixed swing-bed reactors, fluid-bed reactors, or moving beds.
4. The SOx uptake efficiency of the sorbent remained commercially viable even after 210 cycles.

1. 环保问题和新法规促使开发了先进的硫减排策略。
2. Mobil Oil SOx 处理过程（MOST）包括将硫物种转化为SO2/SO3，吸附至高容量吸附剂，然后将硫以主要为SO2和H2S的浓缩流体形式释放。
3. 该过程可以通过固定摆动床反应器、流化床反应器或移动床等不同反应器配置实施。
4. 在经过210个周期后，吸附剂的SOx吸收效率仍然保持在商业可接受水平。
