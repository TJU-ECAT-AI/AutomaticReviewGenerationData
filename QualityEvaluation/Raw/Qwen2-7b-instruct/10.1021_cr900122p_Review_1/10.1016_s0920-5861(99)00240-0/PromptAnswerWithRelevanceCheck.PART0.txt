<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment Process (MOST) is a novel process for reducing sulfur emissions from refinery tailgas to very low levels. It involves three main steps: combustion of sulfur species to convert them into SO2/SO3, adsorption of SOx onto a high-capacity sorbent, and reductive desorption of sulfur as a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S.

The process utilizes a regenerable promoted spinel-based sorbent with high SOx uptake capacities, offering operational benefits over conventional wet scrubbing processes. The sorbent has very high SOx uptake capacities, and the process is robust and operationally simple.

The catalyst selection for the oxidative sorption step includes high surface area alumina and magnesium aluminate spinels with ceria, vanadia, and/or platinum as oxidation promoters. Ceria as an oxidation promoter shows increasing SOx uptake with magnesium content, while platinum and vanadia/ceria combinations are more effective than ceria alone.

The regeneration of the sulfated sorbent is accomplished using reducing gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen sulfide. The primary product of hydrogen reduction is H2S, which reacts further with the sulfated sorbent to desorb Sn and H2S.

The overall process can be operated in fixed swing-bed reactors, fluid-bed reactors, or moving beds, depending on the application. The process is efficient and capable of achieving very low sulfur emissions, making it suitable for various applications beyond Claus tailgas treatment.

Mobil Oil SOx处理过程（MOST）是一种用于降低炼油厂尾气中硫排放的新颖工艺，将其降至极低水平。该流程涉及三个主要步骤：燃烧硫化物将它们转化为SO2/SO3，SOx吸附到高容量吸附剂上，以及还原性脱硫，形成主要为SO2和H2S的浓缩流体。

该过程使用可再生的促进型尖晶石基吸附剂，具有非常高的SOx吸收能力，提供与传统湿式清洗过程相比的优势。吸附剂具有非常高的SOx吸收能力，并且流程既稳健又易于操作。

氧化吸附步骤的催化剂选择包括高表面积的氧化铝和镁铝尖晶石，其中铈、钒和/或铂作为氧化促进剂。铈作为氧化促进剂显示随镁含量增加SOx吸收量增加，而铂和铈/钒组合比仅使用铈更有效。

硫化吸附剂的再生使用氢、一氧化碳、烃类和氢硫酸等还原气体。氢还原的主要产物是H2S，该物质进一步与硫化吸附剂反应以释放Sn和H2S。

整个流程可以运行在固定摆动床反应器、流化床反应器或移动床中，具体取决于应用。流程高效，能够实现非常低的硫排放，适用于多种应用，远超出克劳斯尾气处理。

The oxidative sorption of sulfur oxides involves several factors, including catalyst selection and reaction conditions. High SOx uptakes per weight of catalyst are desired, and the screening process selects catalysts based on conditions such as 1200F, 3500 GHSV, 1% SO2, 4% O2, 10% H2O, and nitrogen as diluent. The process aims to terminate catalyst sulfation when the effluent SO2 concentration exceeds 250 ppmv. The shape of the SO2 concentration profile during adsorption indicates a bandwise sorption process. High SOx uptakes are achieved by using effective oxidation promoters and high-capacity basic sorption sites, such as magnesium oxide sites in magnesium aluminate spinel. Platinum and combinations of vanadia and ceria as oxidation promoters show higher effectiveness compared to ceria alone. The reduction step yields SO2, Sn, or H2S as sulfur-containing products. The process can operate in various configurations, such as fixed swing-bed reactors, fluid-bed reactors, or moving beds. The catalyst demonstrates commercial acceptability after cycling through 210 cycles, with an SOx uptake of 58 wt% initially and 42 wt% after 210 cycles.

氧化硫吸附涉及多个因素，包括催化剂选择和反应条件。每单位催化剂的高SOx吸收量是所需的目标，筛选过程基于1200F、3500 GHSV、1% SO2、4% O2、10% H2O和氮气作为稀释剂的条件来选择催化剂。该过程旨在在出口SO2浓度超过250 ppmv时终止催化剂硫化。吸附过程中SO2浓度曲线的形状表明了带状吸附过程。通过使用有效的氧化促进剂和高容量的基本吸附位点（如镁铝酸盐中的镁氧化物位点）可以实现高SOx吸收能力。铂以及三氧化二铈和氧化钒的组合作为氧化促进剂比单独的三氧化二铈更有效。还原步骤产生SO2、Sn或H2S作为含硫产物。该过程可以在固定摇摆床反应器、流化床反应器或移动床中运行。催化剂经过210个周期循环后仍具有商业可接受性，初始SOx吸收率为58 wt%，210个周期后为42 wt%。

Catalysis Today 55 (2000) 311316 The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment Process (MOST). Catalytic removal of SOx and H2S from refinery tailgas
D.L. Stern , K.E. Nariman, J.S. Buchanan, N.A. Bhore, D.L. Johnson, R.K. Grasselli1

Growing concerns about the environmental impact of sulfur emissions from stationary sources, as well as recent regulatory initiatives, have prompted investigations for advanced sulfur reduction strategies. Herein, we present a novel process/catalyst combination for reducing tailgas SOx and H2S emissions to very low levels (15 ppmw).

The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment Process (MOST) consists of the following steps: (1) combustion of tailgas sulfur species to convert all sulfur species to SO2/SO3; (2) adsorption of SOx onto a high-capacity sorbent; and (3) in a separate step, reductive desorption of the sulfur as a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S.

The MOST Process utilizes a regenerable promoted spinel-based sorbent with very high SOx uptake capacities (>50 wt%), and is both robust and operationally simple. Catalyst selection, process scoping studies, and characterization to help understand the nature of the oxidative sorption and reductive regeneration steps, as well as the state of the sorbent during these steps, are described.
