The process involves three main steps: combustion of tailgas sulfur species to convert all sulfur species to SO2/SO3, adsorption of SOx onto a high-capacity sorbent, and reductive desorption of sulfur as a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S. The sorbent utilized is a regenerable promoted spinel-based catalyst with high SOx uptake capacities. The process is designed to achieve very low levels of SOx and H2S emissions (15 ppmw). The process is both robust and operationally simple. The oxidative sorption step involves the combustion of sulfur species to SO2/SO3, and the regeneration step allows for the release of sulfur species as a concentrated stream of SO2 and H2S.

该过程包含三个主要步骤：尾气硫化物的燃烧将其转化为SO2/SO3，SOx吸附到高容量吸附剂上，以及还原脱附硫作为主要的SO2和H2S浓缩流。使用的吸附剂是一种再生的、促进的镁铝酸盐基催化剂，具有高SOx吸收能力。该过程旨在实现非常低的SOx和H2S排放水平（15 ppmw）。该过程既坚固又操作简单。氧化吸附步骤涉及将硫化物种转化为SO2/SO3，而再生步骤允许以主要的SO2和H2S浓缩流释放硫化物。
