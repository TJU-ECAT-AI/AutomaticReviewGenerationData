Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the importance of selecting the right catalyst for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, have been investigated, with vanadium-based materials showing particularly high activity. Molybdenum-based oxides are promising, offering higher propylene selectivity and better thermal stability despite lower overall activity. The activation of the CH bond is recognized as a critical step in catalytic processes. Theoretical studies propose that hydrogen abstraction by terminal MoO is the most favorable pathway for initial propane activation. Regioselectivity in activation is influenced by the strength difference between a methylene CH bond and a methyl CH bond. Calculations demonstrate that both methyl and methylene groups contribute comparably to the observed kinetic isotopic effects, supporting the involvement of both types of bonds in the overall process. Theoretical KIEs align favorably with experimental numbers, reinforcing the understanding of the redox mechanism using lattice oxygen to abstract hydrogen from the methylene group. Site isolation is essential for addressing selectivity issues, impacting the activation pathways and contributing to the efficiency of the process.
