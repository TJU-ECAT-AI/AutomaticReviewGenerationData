[2] "We report the first detailed density functional theory study on the mechanisms of initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides."
[3] "Although it has been widely accepted that the oxidation of alkanes begins with the activation of the CH bond, which is generally believed to be the rate-determining step for most catalytic processes, much remains obscure for the molecular details of the activation mechanisms."
[4] "It was concluded that ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts follow the same mechanism and that two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of the CH bonds in propane via a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism."
[5] "We find that activating the methylene CH bond is 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond."
[6] "Energetically, our calculations show that the most favorable pathway is the anti hydrogen abstraction from the methylene group."
[7] "For the methyl CH bond activation, our calculations lead to a KIE of 2.32 for CD3CD2CD3 versus CH3CH2CH3 and a KIE of 1.06 for CH3CD2CH3 versus CH3CH2CH3."
[8] "On the basis of the comparison between the observed and the calculated KIEs, we propose that a combined effect from both methylene and methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall KIEs for the ODH of propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the importance of catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in achieving these goals stem from complex reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The document elucidates the collective impact of these factors on process efficiency and suggests that the selectivity issues can be addressed by considering the role of site isolation. The interplay between the different components and conditions influences the effectiveness of ODH processes. The document proposes that a combined effect from both the methylene and methyl C-H bond cleavages contributes significantly to the observed kinetic isotopic effects during the ODH of propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts.
