[1] "Although it has been widely accepted that the oxidation of alkanes begins with the activation of the CH bond, which is generally believed to be the rate-determining step for most catalytic processes, much remains obscure for the molecular details of the activation mechanisms."
[2] "Molybdenum-based oxides are the other promising catalysts for ODH.13,14 Although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability."
[3] "Our calculations lead to an entropy change of 28.6 cal/(mol/K) for the anti hydrogen abstraction, which is in good agreement with the experimentally deduced value of 29.1 cal/(mol/K)."
[4] "We find that breaking a methylene CH bond is 3.94.7 kcal/mol more favorable than breaking a methyl CH bond."
[5] "We consider 6 possible mechanisms of CH bond activation on metal oxides, leading to 17 transition states involving CH activations of both the methyl and methylene groups in propane on Mo3O9."
[6] "The calculated activation energy is 32.3 kcal/mol for the methylene CH bond activations, in reasonably good agreement with the experimental value (28.0 kcal/mol)."
[7] "The 5 + 2 pathway using the methylene CH, although being advocated in the related VOx/ZrO2 systems, leads to a barrier of 49.0 kcal/mol, which is too high, and an incorrect KIE as compared to either the VOx/ZrO2 or MoOx/ZrO2 system."
[8] "On the basis of the comparison between the observed and the calculated KIEs, we propose that a combined effect from both methylene and methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall KIEs for the ODH of propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are highlighted, alongside the proposed reaction mechanisms that involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The factors collectively influence process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The document elucidates that the most feasible reaction pathway for initial propane activation is hydrogen abstraction, with the calculated activation energy for the methylene CH bond activations agreeing reasonably well with experimental values. The document contrasts the 5 + 2 pathway using the methylene CH, which is less favorable due to its high barrier and incorrect kinetic isotopic effect (KIE), with the 2 + 4 pathway that offers a good KIE but leads to a too-high barrier. Based on the comparison between observed and calculated KIEs, the document proposes that a combined effect from both methylene and methyl CH bond cleavages contributes to the experimentally observed overall KIEs for the ODH of propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），文献讨论了各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括体金属氧化物和支撑系统。在实现高选择性和转化率方面的挑战被突出，同时提出了涉及C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-摘取的反应机制。这些因素共同影响过程效率，其中位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。文献阐述了初始丙烷激活最可行的反应途径是氢摘取，计算得到的甲基CH键激活能量与实验值有良好的一致性。文献对比了使用甲基CH的5 + 2路径，由于其过高且错误的KIE而不太有利，与提供良好KIE但壁垒过高的2 + 4路径进行了对比。基于观察到和计算出的KIE之间的比较，文献提出了一种结合甲基和甲基CH键断裂效果的组合，有助于实验观察到的丙烷到丙烯的ODH整体KIEs在MoOx/ZrO2催化剂上的表现。
