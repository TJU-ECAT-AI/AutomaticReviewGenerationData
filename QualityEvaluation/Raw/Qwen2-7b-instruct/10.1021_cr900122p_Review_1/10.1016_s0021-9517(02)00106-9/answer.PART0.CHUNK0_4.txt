[1] "Many synthetic challenges are presented by established structurereactivity relationships and by well-recognized goals in catalysis research. This is particularly true for heterogeneous catalysts, since synthetic control over the structures of complex solids is still rather limited."
[2] "For many catalysts, desirable properties appear to be associated with well-defined active sites containing one or perhaps a few metal centers (single sites) [3237]."
[3] "The presence of oligomeric tetrahedral vanadium sites appears to be a key component of the more active compositions (10 18% vanadia)."
[4] "In a similar fashion, propane ODH catalysts with various V/Al/O compositions were generated by cothermolyses of OV(O tBu)3 and [Al(O tBu)3]2 [119]."
[5] "Based on catalytic and analytical data (PXRD, temperature-programmed reduction, and Raman, diffuse reflectence UVvis (DRUV vis), and 51V NMR spectroscopy), it appears that the most active catalysts consist of nanocrystalline MgO particles covered by small Mg3(VO4)2 domains."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems are crucial. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to factors like C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a pivotal role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing the catalytic sites, preventing ion mobility, and hindering the formation of MOM linkages. The efficiency of the process hinges on the balance between these factors, and the use of molecular precursors through the TMP method offers precise control over stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site structure, contributing significantly to the development of new generations of catalysts and support materials.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，不同类型的催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统至关重要。在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临的挑战源于C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体形成以及2H移除等因素。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中扮演着核心角色，通过稳定催化位点、限制离子迁移和阻止MOM连接链的形成来提升选择性。该过程效率的决定因素在于这些因素之间的平衡，而分子前体通过TMP方法的应用提供了对组分比、纳米结构、均一性和催化剂活性位点结构的精确控制，为新一代催化剂和载体材料的发展做出了重大贡献。
