The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a challenging process that requires high selectivity and conversion. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process, and the TMP method is one of the synthetic methodologies that can be used to generate catalysts with improved properties. The TMP method employs metal complexes containing oxygen-rich ligands, such as LnM[OSi(O tBu)3]m and LnM[O2P(O tBu)2]m, to create carbon-free, homogeneous mixed-element oxide materials. The use of nonaqueous solvents in the TMP method minimizes pore collapse upon drying, providing high pore volumes and surface areas. Additionally, the precursors serve as molecular models for oxide-supported catalytic sites, offering control over stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site structure. The TMP method allows for the synthesis of catalysts that outperform related catalysts obtained through more traditional routes, contributing significantly to the development of new generations of catalysts and support materials. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues by providing a stabilized environment that hinders ion mobility and prevents the formation of MOM linkages, thus enhancing the efficiency of the process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢是一个需要高选择性和转化率的挑战性过程。催化剂在这一过程中发挥着关键作用，而TMP方法是一种可以用来生成具有改进性能催化剂的合成技术。TMP方法采用包含氧丰富配体的金属复合物，如LnM[OSi(O tBu)3]m和LnM[O2P(O tBu)2]m，来创建碳自由、均一的多元元素氧化物材料。在TMP方法中使用非水溶剂可以减少干燥过程中的孔塌陷，提供高孔体积和表面积。此外，前体作为氧化物支持催化位点的分子模型，提供了对组成、纳米结构、均一性和催化位点结构的控制。通过TMP方法可以合成性能优于传统方法获得的相关催化剂的催化剂，对新一代催化剂和支撑材料的发展做出了重要贡献。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着至关重要的作用，通过提供一个阻止离子移动并防止形成MOM连接的稳定环境，从而提高过程效率。
