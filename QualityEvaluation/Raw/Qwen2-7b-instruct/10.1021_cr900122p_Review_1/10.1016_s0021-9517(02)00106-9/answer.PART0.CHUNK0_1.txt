[1] "Given the widespread use of propylene in the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide, propane ODH (Scheme 1) has attracted much attention as an alternative source of this industrially useful molecule [9597]."
[2] "However, this selective oxidation is difficult to achieve due to the tendency of propylene to overoxidize to CO and CO2 under the reaction conditions."
[3] "Recent reviews and reports on this subject have suggested that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH [95118]."
[4] "Of the support materials that have been examined, some of the most promising are Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO."
[5] "It was also hoped that use of this method might provide more controlled transformations to well-defined materials with high surface densities of the desired catalytic sites."
[6] "The performance of these materials as catalysts for propane ODH was evaluated by the method reported by Iglesia, Bell, and co-workers, which focuses on intrinsic selectivities (extrapolated to 0% conversion) that allow useful comparisons between catalysts [111,112]."
[7] "The observed activities ranged from 28 mmol propylene produced (g cat)1 h1 (673 K, 14% vanadia) to 100 mmol (g cat)1 h1 (773 K, 14% vanadia)."
[8] "Further comparisons showed that these catalysts were more active and selective, under the same ODH conditions, than materials of similar composition but prepared by conventional impregnation methods using NH4VO3-oxalic acid as the vanadium source."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, particularly propane, has attracted significant interest due to its potential as an alternative source of propylene, a crucial industrial molecule used in the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from propylene's tendency to overoxidize under typical reaction conditions. Vanadium-based catalysts have shown superior performance in propane ODH compared to other metal-containing catalysts. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and magnesium oxide (MgO) are among the most promising support materials for these catalysts. The thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method was hoped to enable the synthesis of catalysts with controlled transformations leading to well-defined materials with high surface densities of desired catalytic sites. Materials synthesized via the TMP method were evaluated for their intrinsic selectivities, which allowed for meaningful comparisons between catalysts. The TMP-derived catalysts exhibited higher activities and selectivities for propane ODH compared to those prepared by conventional impregnation methods, showcasing the potential of the TMP approach in enhancing catalyst performance.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），特别是丙烷，由于其作为生产聚丙烯、丙烯腈和丙烯氧化物所需工业分子的潜在替代来源而引起了广泛的关注。在这些条件下，丙烯倾向于过度氧化，导致选择性和转化率难以达到。钒基催化剂在丙烷ODH中的性能优于其他金属催化剂。铝氧化物（Al2O3）、锆氧化物（ZrO2）和镁氧化物（MgO）是这些催化剂最具前景的支持材料。热解分子前体（TMP）方法被期望能够实现对催化材料的精确控制，从而生成具有高表面密度的所需催化活性位点的定义明确的材料。通过TMP方法合成的材料被用于评估其内在选择性，这使得催化剂之间进行有意义的比较成为可能。TMP衍生的催化剂在丙烷ODH过程中的活动性和选择性高于通过传统浸渍方法使用NH4VO3-草酸盐作为钒源制备的催化剂，这表明了TMP方法增强催化剂性能的潜力。
