[4] "Many synthetic challenges are presented by established structurereactivity relationships and by well-recognized goals in catalysis research."
[5] "For example, the MOM heterolinkages of bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces are associated with reactivities that are not observed for the corresponding homolinkages MOM and MOM."
[6] "For the most part, these efforts have involved modifications of the solgel synthesis of oxides."
[7] "Thus, it is important to develop methods to achieve the controlled chemical modification of surfaces via the introduction of well-defined active sites."
[8] "This approach includes what may be described as surface organometallic chemistry, which has been used by Basset and co-workers to prepare highly active catalysts for alkane metathesis and alkane hydrogenolysis."
[9] "In synthesizing a variety of multicomponent oxide materials with tailored properties, we have employed a molecular building-block approach referred to as the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method."

[12] "When the thermolyses are performed in nonpolar solvents (e.g., toluene or n-octane), a solvent-containing gel is often obtained."
[13] "Although the solgel process and the TMP method both represent low-temperature routes to metastable materials, the TMP method offers several advantages."
[14] "In studies on use of the TMP method for generation of amorphous aluminosilicates, an important class of solid acid materials, the chemical nature of the precursor has a profound influence on the properties of the resultant solid."
[15] "For example, Al2O3 · 2SiO2 materials derived from Al[OSi(O tBu)3]3(HO iPr) · 1 4[Al(O iPr)3]4 and [(O iPr)2AlOSi(O tBu)3]2 (both with Al/Si = 1) have quite different microstructures and surface acidities."

[22] "The performance of these materials as catalysts for propane ODH was evaluated by the method reported by Iglesia, Bell, and co-workers, which focuses on intrinsic selectivities (extrapolated to 0% conversion) that allow useful comparisons between catalysts."
[23] "The intrinsic selectivities for propylene formation were as high as 95.5% at 673 K (for 23 wt% vanadia)."

[25] "For these catalysts, the intrinsic selectivities for propylene formation are good and very similar over a range of vanadium contents (up to 84% at 673 K, 82% at 723 K, and 79.5% at 773 K)."
[26] "The activities of the TMP-derived V/Al/O catalysts, on a per gram basis (up to 49.0 mmol (g cat)1 h1 at 773 K), are moderate compared to those of the TMP-derived V/Zr/O systems."
[27] "A further modified version of the TMP method involves the impregnation of a high-surface-area support."
[28] "Calcination of OV(O tBu)3/MgO materials at 823 K led to catalysts with high surface areas (from 185 to 310 m2 g1)."
[29] "Based on catalytic and analytical data (PXRD, temperature-programmed reduction, and Raman, diffuse reflectance UVvis (DRUV vis), and 51V NMR spectroscopy), it appears that the most active catalysts consist of nanocrystalline MgO particles covered by small Mg3(VO4)2 domains."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes presents challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, primarily due to the tendency of products to over-oxidize. Catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in facilitating the ODH process. Achieving high selectivity often requires precise control over catalyst composition and structure. The process efficiency is influenced by factors such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation is important in addressing selectivity issues by providing a stabilized environment that hinders ion mobility and prevents the formation of MOM linkages.
