(1) "The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase. The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing [19-21]:(i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C;"

(2) "In contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised;"

(3) "a definite concentration of propane was required for the reaction to proceed: it was stopped either when the total concentration of propane and oxygen was lowered to 60% (propane oxygen = 0.55; T = 500C) or when the ratio propane/oxygen was lowered to 0.14 (propane + oxygen= 91%; T= 500oc);"

(4) "an effect of the reactor volume and of its empty zone on the reaction performance was observed, with and without the catalyst."

(5) "The observation of a homogeneous reaction in the pre-catalyst zone [20] is in good accordance with previous works showing that non-catalytic vapour phase oxidation of propane takes place in the range 350-500C [171,172]."

(6) "However, it must be underlined that the bismuth molybdate of scheelite type here considered does not initiate surface radicals as intermediates of the formation of both propylene and acrolein."

(7) "On the other hand, the observed selectivities, in fact, should partly reflect the ability of the considered scheelite type B-Mo-O catalysts to convert propylene to acrolein [20] and partly the degradation of acrolein under the chosen reaction temperature (500C)."

(8) "From a practical point of view, two directions of improvement of the considered catalytic system emerge from the above results. The first one is the improvement of the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein in the overall process of partial oxidation of propane."

(9) "However, it is noteworthy that propylene, propanal, acetone and ethylene stem directly from propane as shown by the study of their selectivities as a function of the contact time [23]."

(10) "We may conclude that the reaction intermediates to oxygenate products, which necessarily involves an oxygenation step, should be probably: (i) the 1-propyloxy species as precursor of propanal, acrolein,acrylic acid and (ii) the 2-propyloxy species as precursor of acetone and acetic acid (see Scheme 2 and Fig. 8)."

(11) "The third point is the obtaining of propanal with both propane and propylene reactants (Table 4)."

(12) "The main feature of the obtained performances is that they are similar to those obtained in the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein (Table 5),particularly in the case of the most active and selective catalysts."

(13) "Ammonia seems either to inhibit the propylene gaseous formation or/and to promote its surface formation since conversions and selectivities to acrolein and acrylonitrile,respectively, are quite similar (Table 5)."

(14) "As to carbon oxides formation, it decreased with the partial pressure of ammonia; this was explained by a competitive adsorption of ammonia and oxygen leading to a decrease of the concentration of surface degradation."

(15) "In the case of the BiMo(V)O catalysts, the direct oxidation of propane to organic compounds was reported as the main route for the BPO catalysts."

(16) "The other route should be the dissociative adsorption of propane as 1-propyloxy species by nucleophilic attack of the terminal CH3 group by lattice O2 species (Scheme 8 and Fig. 11):"

(17) "The nature and the number of steps to organic products cannot be discussed because of the lack of experimental data reported in the literature."

(18) "Indeed, at 350C, addition of water decreased the yields of propylene and CO2 (probably by competitive adsorption between water and propane) but increased the selectivity of the former at the expense of the latter."

(19) "So there is a mutual influence between the acid-base and the oxidizing properties of the surface for the metal mixed oxides."

(20) "When the concentration of ammonia is increased in the propane feed gas for example, propane conversion and COx selectivity decrease, propylene selectivity increases whereas a maximum is observed for acrylonitrile selectivity (Table 7)."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The process involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges include the need for high selectivity and conversion rates while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. 

The document highlights the importance of the catalyst structure and composition in influencing the efficiency of the process. It emphasizes the need for acid/oxidizing sites for C-H bond activation and basic/nucleophilic sites for proton abstraction or oxygen/nitrogen atom insertion, which are crucial for each elementary step. Site isolation plays a key role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the reaction pathways.

In terms of reaction mechanisms, the document suggests that the process involves C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The electronic structure of the organic adsorbed species is also considered in determining the reaction mechanisms. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by affecting the reaction rates, selectivity, and yield of desired products.

The document provides insights into the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of water or ammonia, which impact the selectivity and conversion. It discusses how these factors can be manipulated to optimize the process. For instance, the presence of ammonia can either inhibit or promote the formation of certain products, depending on the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions.

In summary, the document underscores the complexity of the ODH process and the importance of understanding the detailed reaction mechanisms, catalyst properties, and reaction conditions to achieve efficient and selective conversion of alkanes into valuable organic compounds. Comparative studies of propane and propylene partial oxidation can also provide valuable insights into optimizing the process for the selective oxidation of propane to organic products.
