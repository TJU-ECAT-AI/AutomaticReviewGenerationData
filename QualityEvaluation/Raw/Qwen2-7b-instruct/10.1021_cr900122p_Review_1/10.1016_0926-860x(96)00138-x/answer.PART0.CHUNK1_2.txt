The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase. The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing [19-21]:(i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C;(ii) in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions,the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised;
(iii) a definite concentration of propane was required for the reaction to proceed: it was stopped either when the total concentration of propane and oxygen was lowered to 60% (propane oxygen = 0.55; T = 500C) or when the ratio propane/oxygen was lowered to 0.14 (propane + oxygen= 91%; T= 500oc);
(iv) appreciable amounts of homogeneous propane oxidation (mainly to propylene) occurred at 500C in absence of the catalyst. No acrolein was detected in these conditions;
(v) an effect of the reactor volume and of its empty zone on the reaction performance was observed, with and without the catalyst. For example no reaction was observed when the reactor volume was small with and without catalyst.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, involves a complex interplay between catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the proposed mechanisms. Catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise from the need for optimal balance among the acid-base, oxidizing, and reducing properties of the catalyst surfaces. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation, which refers to the separation of functional groups on the catalyst surface, is critical for enhancing selectivity. 

For instance, the literature indicates that the reaction starts suddenly at 400°C, indicating the importance of temperature control. The conversion of propane decreases while the selectivity to acrolein increases with temperature, suggesting that the catalyst surface properties might change with temperature. The requirement for a certain concentration of propane and the impact of reactor volume demonstrate the sensitivity of the reaction to these parameters. The absence of acrolein in the presence of catalyst at 500°C in homogeneous propane oxidation further highlights the role of catalysts in influencing the reaction pathway. 

Overall, the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process hinges on a detailed understanding of the surface chemistry and the mechanisms governing the reaction, including the balance between the acid-base, oxidizing, and reducing properties of the catalysts. Comparative studies of propane and propylene oxidation could offer insights into optimizing the process. The literature underscores the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues and improving the overall efficiency of the process.

烷烃，尤其是丙烷的氧化脱氢涉及到催化剂性质、反应条件和提出机制之间复杂的相互作用。如块状金属氧化物和支持系统这样的催化剂在这一过程中扮演着关键角色。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战往往来自于催化剂表面性质需要达到最优平衡。提出的反应机制涉及C-H键的激活、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H的抽象。

例如，文献表明反应在400°C突然开始，表明温度控制的重要性。随着温度升高，丙烷的转化率降低而丙烯醛的选择性增加，这表明催化剂表面性质可能随温度变化。对一定浓度丙烷的要求以及反应器体积的影响显示了反应对这些参数的敏感性。在500°C下，没有催化剂存在时进行均相丙烷氧化并未检测到丙烯醛，进一步强调了催化剂在影响反应路径方面的作用。

总体而言，氧化脱氢过程的效率取决于对表面化学和指导反应机制的详细理解，包括催化剂酸碱、氧化和还原性质之间的平衡。比较丙烷和丙烯的氧化研究可能为优化过程提供见解。文献强调了在解决选择性问题和提高整体过程效率中，位点隔离的重要性。
