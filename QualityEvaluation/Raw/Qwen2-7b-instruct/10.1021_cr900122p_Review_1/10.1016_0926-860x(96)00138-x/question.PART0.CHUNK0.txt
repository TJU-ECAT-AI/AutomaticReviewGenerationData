Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 Review On the partial oxidation of propane and propylene on mixed metal oxide catalysts

Laboratoire Catalyse et Spectrochimie -- URA CNRS 414 -- lsmra-Universit, 6, Boulevard du Marchal Juin, 14050 Caen Cedex, France Received 8 May 1995; accepted 4 April 1996 Abstract The present review analyses the literature data reported on the partial oxidation of propane to organic compounds (acrolein, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile) over mixed metal oxides, mainly magnesium vanadates, vanadia bismuth molybdates and vanadia antimony. The data were compared to those reported on the partial oxidation of propylene over bismuth molybdate and antimony--tin multicomponent oxides and over cuprous simple oxide. For both reactions, we analyzed the involved reaction mechanisms, intermediate species, active phases and active sites.
The role of water produced during the reaction and that of the Brinsted acid sites were shown to be important in the determination of the selectivity of the expected products. The main conclusion of our study is that a good mix of acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products.

1. Introduction
Until recently the main way of better utilization of light alkanes was their transformation into the corresponding olefins [1-7]. Thus, acrolein [8-14],acrylonitrile [9,12] and acrylic acid [15-17] are produced from propane in two step processes via propylene (Scheme 1). However, in the present economic circumstances, the high cost of propylene production prompted the development of researches on the direct transformation of propane into oxygenates through selective oxidation [18-33]. The success of the obtention of maleic anhydride directly from n-butane has encouraged these studies. In parallel, investigations on the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane have been undertaken 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright  1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Scheme I. The chemical routes of valorization of propane. since this route is expected to lead to lower costs of propylene production as compared to the non-catalytic and non-oxidative processes [34].
Another reason to specifically pay attention to use propane, as now acknowl- edged, is that the behaviour of light alkanes (C-C 6) in catalytic partial oxidation reactions is different from the one to another [35-38]. For examples, Michalakos et al. [35] compared catalytic oxidation of ethane, propane, 2-meth- ylpropane, n-butane, n-pentane and cyclohexane over VPO and VMgO oxides.
A wide range of products ranging from alkenes, dienes, anhydrides, acids and carbon oxides were observed [35] and the relative selectivities of alkanes and oxygenate products (organic compounds and carbon oxides) sensibly varied [35].
An explanation of these results based on the concept of site isolation and on the effect of the metal-oxygen bond strength (or metal reducibility) cannot be held for all studied alkanes, particularly for propane and ethane [35]. It seemed that the size and geometry of the alkane molecules play an important role in the reaction course. Thus, an intrinsic sensibility of each alkane to further non-selec- tive oxidation of the reaction intermediates or products has been suggested to explain the differences in selectivity in the oxidation of C 3 and C4-C 5 alkanes,respectively, on VPO catalysts.
When considering the selective catalytic oxidation of propane into oxy- genates, two main difficulties arise. The first one is, as for the partial oxidation of other light alkanes, the lower reactivity of the reactant as compared to that of the formed products. Activation of the reactant needs operating conditions (temperature as high as 500C for example) which are detrimental to the stability of the product. Therefore, the considered reaction requires catalysts with specific properties: activation of propane partial oxidation and decrease or inhibition of the product oxidation. The second difficulty is to design suitable catalysts because little is known about the involved reaction mechanisms up to now [19-21,34,35].
These difficulties combined with a strong economical incentive led to rather pragmatic studies, notably in the case of the selective oxidation of propane to acrolein [19-21]. It is worthwhile to note that the published studies, though scarce, concern a great number of catalytic formulations, mostly mixed metal oxides. It is generally admitted [19-21,25-30] that a two stages process occurs

3 (the dehydrogenation of propane into propylene preceding the oxidation of the latter into the expected products). The basic idea of these formulations is that associating known solid phases active for the oxydehydrogenation reaction (ODHR) of propane and known solid phases active for the selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein, modified or not, catalyses the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein [39]. However, as it will be shown below, the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein is probably not the simple addition of the ODHR of propane to propylene and the oxidation of propylene to acrolein [19-21]. Moreover,some studies suggest, on the contrary, the direct oxidation of propane into acrolein without propylene as intermediate [22-24]. Other routes than olefins have also been suggested in the case of the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on V 2 P207 catalysts [40,41 ].
In the present study we analyse the available data on the direct oxidation of propane into propylene and oxygenates in the presence of mixed metal oxides based catalysts. We focus our study on the catalytic acrolein formation but we also examine the direct production of acrylic acid and acrylonitrile from propane oxidation and ammoxidation (Scheme 1). This comparison is justified since some catalytic systems are reported to be active for both acrolein and acryloni- trile production and because it leads to a discussion on the effect of water or ammonia on the performance of the considered catalytic systems. On the other hand, taking into account the nature of the catalysts used for the oxidation of propane and the postulated reaction mechanisms, it seemed useful to report also the nature of the catalysts and the postulated reaction mechanisms for the oxidation of propylene. In other words, we discuss in parallel the catalytic selective oxidation of propane and propylene as a whole, emphasizing on the involved reaction mechanisms. Besides, as a preliminary discussion, we recall the main chemical paths involved in the gas phase partial oxidation of propane and some related thermodynamic data. The thermodynamic calculations were performed in order to compare feasible and competitive gas phase routes from propane to each possible product. Obviously, as the hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is a thermodynamically favorable process, surface kinetics determine the selectivity of the products. So the present thermodynamic calculations served as a guideline for mechanistic proposals.
2. Products from the partial oxidation of propane and propylene
Contrary to the catalysts used for the partial oxidation of propylene [8-14],those used for the partial oxidation of propane are still not highly selective [19-30] and a great number of products are observed:propylene as a product of the ODHR;• acrolein, propanal, acetone as products of selective oxidation reactions.
Acrylic and propanoic acid are also detected;

The theoretical reaction sequences involved in the gas phase formation of the above oxygenate products are described in Scheme 2. The corresponding standard enthalpies of reaction -- calculated from the standard enthalpies of formation of the products [42] -- are reported in Fig. 1.
2.1. Propylene formation from propane
Propylene can be formed from the direct oxidation of propane. A two step process through the 2-propanol intermediate (Scheme 2) can also be envisaged.
The latter route -- unless kinetic inhibition -- cannot be excluded since its first step (formation of the 2-propanol) is more thermodynamically favorable (A H =-174.1 kJ mol -l) than the direct route: propanepropylene (AH = -117.1 kJ mol-1).
2.2. Acrolein formation
Acrolein is formed from propylene in a two steps process (Scheme 2) through the allylic alcohol intermediate. The second step is more exothermic (AH =

As for acrolein formation from propane, it formally consists of the insertion of an oxygen atom into a C-H bond and the dehydrogenation of a C-C and a C-O bond. The order of occurrence of the corresponding steps depends on the postulated reaction mechanisms. In the mechanism involving propylene as intermediate the order is: (i) dehydrogenation in order to transform a saturated C-C bond into an unsaturated C=C bond (ii) then insertion of an oxygen atom into a C-H bond to produce the allylic alcohol and (iii) finally dehydrogenation 6
M.M. Bettahar et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
of the formed C-O bond to produce acrolein. However, another order may exist and involves 1-propanol as intermediate. The two routes are illustrated in Scheme 2 and the corresponding standard reaction enthalpies (calculated at 25C) are reported in Fig. 1.
It appears from the data reported in Fig. 1 that, whatever the pathway, the standard reaction enthalpy of the first step ( - 117.1 kJ mol-  and - 150.4 kJ mol- for propylene and 1-propanol formation, respectively) is lower than that of the following steps (-300.0 kJ tool-1 and -306.7 kJ mol- for acrolein formation from propylene and 1-propanol, respectively). These thermodynamic data imply that the first step needs a higher reaction temperature than the second step in good accordance with the difference of reactivity between propylene and propane as evoked in the introduction part. In the same way, the reaction temperature needed should be lower for 1-propanol formation (A H  = - 150.4 kJ mol i) than for propylene formation (A H  = - 117.1 kJ mol- 1).
2.3. Formation of acetone and acetic acid
The partial oxidation of propane to acrolein is often accompanied by acetone [23] or acetic acid formation [24,26]. The accepted mechanism [26] implies that acetic acid is a product of a consecutive oxidation reaction of acetone and that acetone stems from propylene via 2-propanol formation (Scheme 2). However,as for acrolein production, the direct production of acetone from propane through 2-propanol cannot be ruled out (Scheme 2). Thermodynamics are also favourable in this case (Fig. 1) since the standard reaction enthalpy of 2-pro- panol formation is higher ( - 174.1 kJ mol I ) than that of propylene ( - 117.1 kJ mol- ').If we consider the thermodynamic data (Fig. 1) as well as the reaction pathways (Scheme 2) for both acrolein and acetone (acetic acid) formation, the selectivities should depend on the competition between several routes: the oxyhydration of propylene into 1-propanol or 2-propanol, the allylic oxidation of propylene and the direct oxidation of propane. The real selectivities should depend on the kinetics of the reactions and on the nature of the catalyst used as it shall be discussed below.
2.4. Formation of acetaldehyde, methanol and formaldehyde
Acetaldehyde formation is observed during the partial oxidation of propylene [7,43]. The partial oxidation of propane also gives rise to the concomitant formation of acetaldehyde, methanol and formaldehyde [22]. In this case, the main source of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde should be propylene as interme- diate through the oxidative breaking of its C=C bond:
CH3CH=CH 2 + 0 2  CH3CHO + CH20
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
7 As for methanol, it should be produced from formaldehyde through the Cannizzaro reaction [44]:

Acetaldehyde should also stem from propanal oxidation and, in turn, should be oxidized to acetic acid:

The thermodynamic data of the above reactions strongly depend on the envisaged mechanisms and the reactivity of the system is difficult to predict.
However, it has been reported that C2-O and C1-O products arising from the catalytic partial oxidation of propane are stable at rather low temperatures
( < 400C) [22,27].
3. Selective oxidation of propylene
3.1. Formation of acrolein
The industrial catalytic formulations for propylene oxidation (ammoxidation) to acrolein (acrylonitrile) are based on multicomponent metal oxides containing mainly Bi-Mo(W)-O phases modified by various metal elements such as Fe, Co, Ni (Table 1). The conversions and selectivities are high (87-98% and 90-97%, respectively) and obtained in the temperature range of 250-450C.
This system has been recently reviewed by Morooka and Ueda [48]. Several investigations have been carried out on mixed oxides based on molybdenum [49-55] or antimony [10,56,57] or on the Cu20 simple oxide [8,14]. We sum up the main results as following.

3.1.1. BiMoO catalysts
BiMoO catalysts are generally prepared by the coprecipitation method [49- 55,58]. They consist of different phases interacting in a more or less complex manner [48]. The addition of divalent metal molybdate improves both the activity and the selectivity by interactivity with the basic molybdate leading to the so-called synergy effect, the nature of which is still discussed [59,60]. The synergy effect between M H molybdate and the bismuth molybdate, reported by Moro-oka et al. [61], was attributed to support effect. Another type of synergy effect was evidenced by Vedrine et al. [62,63] in the case of FeCoBiMoO catalysts obtained by mechanical mixing of BizMo3Ol2 and Fel_xCOxMOO4 phases. This effect was mainly attributed to morphological changes of the sample mixture during the reaction course and shown by using several physical techniques (ESR, XPS, EDEX-STEM, TEM, XRD and MSssbauer and UV spectroscopy): small mixed Fe and Co molybdate particles were found to be deposited on the large Bi molybdate particles and, moreover, the spreading of the latter on the former [63]. The Fe I .COxMOO 4 particles are supposed to play the role of a fast electron conducting material which enhances the mobility and the efficiency of the redox mechanism [64]. The active and selective phase was believed to be the overlaying bismuth molybdate compounds [63]. No new phase was detected during the experiments [63].
Several studies also showed that the lattice oxygen anions were involved in the oxidation process [51-53,65-67]. The mobility of these ions was mainly demonstrated by 180 2 [61-65] and 2D tracers techniques [65] and Raman and IR spectroscopy [67]. It is interesting to note that, when the catalysts are promoted by M H cations, the degree of participation of the considered ions to the reaction depends on the cation radius [11]. Thus, for M  cations of radius lower than that of the Bi H cation (Ni, Co, Mn for example), only the lattice oxygen atoms of the BiMoO groups are involved in the reaction process whereas the Mn-O groups serve as oxide support [11]. However, for oxides of scheelite type structure,when the radius of the M Ix cation is higher than that of the Bi nl cation (such as Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb) all the lattice oxygen atoms are involved in the reaction [11]. In these oxides the presence of cationic vacancies enhances the lattice oxygen atoms mobility and should explain the observed promoting effects [54].
Keulks et al. [58] investigated propylene oxidation kinetics on BiMoO and (Fe) Bi-Mo-O catalysts over the temperature range of 325 to 475C. The apparent activation energies and the reaction orders for both propylene and oxygen changed with temperature. It was found that the reaction obeyed the Mars and Van Krevelen type mechanism and was controlled by the reduction step of the catalyst at high temperature and by the reoxidation step at low temperature [58]. These results are in good agreement with those obtained for the reoxidation of BiMoO catalysts studied by TPD, XRD, Auger spectroscopy and kinetics of individual reduction and reoxidation steps of the same catalysts [68,69]. Carbon dioxide formation was also observed to not obey the redox

On the other hand, the kinetic studies of Haber et al. [70] on the same catalytic system indicates that acrolein is formed on Bi III sites and that the slow reaction step is the activation of propylene. The formation of carbon oxides should be facilitated by Fe IH ions and occurs as a parallel reaction where the slow step is oxygen activation [70]. Acetaldehyde, a secondary product, is also formed in a parallel reaction [70]. At high temperatures the reaction is diffusion controlled [70].
The mechanistic studies show that the first step of the partial oxidation of propylene is the formation of a symmetric "rr-allylic species [12,68,69] (Scheme 3). Studies where allyl radical were in situ generated [71-74] as well as labelling studies [8,75-77] confirmed this conclusion. These species have also been directly detected as radicals by in situ methods: spin-trapping technique [78], IR spectroscopy [79], EPR matrix isolation spectroscopy [73,74]. It was suggested that the active sites for propylene chemisorption are molybdenum dioxo groups bridged to bismuth-oxygen groups that bring about the rate determining a-hy- drogen abstraction [80]:%/9 Mo 6+ - O - Bi +3 - - Mo 6+

Moreover, it seems that under normal stoichiometric feed conditions and high conversions only one Mo dioxo is involved whereas two Mo dioxo groups are necessary under milder conditions (low feed partial pressures by inert gas dilution) [81].
The subsequent steps from the allyl radical to acrolein [7,77,80-82] can be summarized as a succession of redox and acid-base steps [7,80] (Scheme 3).
The "rr-allyl anion should be first formed by proton abstraction on a basic active site and then oxidized to the n-r-allyl cation on a redox active site. Through a nucleophilic attack by a lattice O2-anion, the latter species forms the o--allylic species which, in turn, gives rise to acrolein by a hydride abstraction in a redox step. The intervention of a nv-allylic species is invoked to explain the obtention of 1-d 1 and 3,3-d 2 acrolein molecules from 1,1-d 2 propylene (Scheme 3) in the same proportions (30% and 70% respectively) as from a 1:1 mixture of 1,l-d 2 and 3,3-d 2 allyl alcohol molecules [81]: the obtained labelled acrolein molecules should reflect the nucleophilic attack of the 0 2- anion on either the C I or the C 3 of the --allylic species to form isomeric o--allylic species whereas their proportions reflect the isotopic effect kH/k D during the abstraction step of a hydrogen atom from the o--allylic species (Scheme 3). These results suppose that the interconversion between w and o- species is reversible [80].
In this mechanistic scheme it is supposed that surface carbenium is stabilized more likely than the radical species [7]. However, the discussion about the homolytic versus heterolytic process can be removed if we consider redox and acid-base equilibria at the catalytic surface shown below (M = Mo or Bi):

On the other hand, in analogy with the homogeneous SN 2 mechanism [83,84],the direct o--bonded allylic alkoxide formation from propylene (Scheme 4) may also occur through the nucleophilic attack of the O 2- anion on the C=C bond concerted with the abstraction of a hydride ion from the CH 3 group. This mechanism is allowed by the electronic structure of propylene where the allylic C-H bond of the CH 3 group is conjugated with the w orbitals of the C=C bond. The same SN; mechanism should also explain the isomerization of the o-(D)-allyl surface species:

3.1.2. SbSnO catalysts
The SbSnO based catalysts prepared by the coprecipitation method have been shown to be also very heterogeneous since they contained several crystalline phases depending on the calcination temperature, the duration of heating, the nominal antimony content and the presence or not of metal additives [85-90].
Among the several phases two of them have been identified:- - the rutile type phase Sn(Sb)O 2 corresponding to a solid solution of Sb with SnO 2;-- an antimony oxide phase corresponding to 5b60]3 or ot and 13 SbO 4 stoichiometries.
The multiphasic nature of the catalysts is the main reason of the difficulty to identify the active phase(s). It has been observed that high activity and selectiv- ity were reached when, in one hand, both the Sn(Sb)O 2 and Sb204 phases are present and, in the other hand, the catalyst surface is enriched with antimony [87]. Many authors believe that the selectivity properties are mainly provided by the formation of a solid solution in which the Sb 5+ species are stabilized by the SnO 2 tetragonal structure [91,92]. The octahedrally coordinated Sb 5+ species dissolved in the SnO 2 matrix were also believed to be active sites for the allylic oxidation in association with Sb 4+ species for the oxygen activation [92].
However, the Sb 4+ ions have also been proposed as the active sites [93]. A more complex site was proposed for multicomponent SbSnO catalysts containing iron [80] composed of bridging oxygens which connect two Sb 5+ and two Sb 3+

atoms. The Sb 3+ species are H-abstraction sites whereas the Sb 5+ species are associated with O-insertion sites [80]. Comparing Sb-Sn-O and Sb-Sn-Fe-O systems it was concluded that the active site is a redox couple SbS+/Sb 3+ in a specific arrangement which may be formed at the surface of the Sb-Sn-O 2 solid solution or at the surface of a thin Sb20 4 layer deposited on the solid solution [87]. It has also been proposed that selective catalysts consist in an oriented film of Sb20 a supported by the Sn(Sb)O 2 phase [88,94].
Allen et al. [13], comparing TPD and catalytic experiments over a Sb-Fe-O catalyst prepared by the batch method [13], showed that acrolein is formed only when the catalyst was in the reduced state confirming the role of lattice oxygen.
From mechanistic studies, the irreversible formation of r allyl species from the allyl precursors was proposed [80,94]:

in contrast (reversible formation) with what was suggested for bismuth-molyb- date catalysts [80]. This difference between molybdate and antimony based catalysts has been related to terminal unsaturated Mo--O groups and to bridging Sb-O-Sb groups, respectively [80]: the inserted oxygen bonds should be weakened and, as such, more reversibly broken on unsaturated metal (Mo) than on saturated metal (Sb) [80]. It also seemed that the considered 7r  (r intercon- version was not influenced by the presence of adsorbed 0 2 as shown by studies of the Sb-SnO system both in the presence and the absence of 0 2 feed [81,95,96].
3.1.3. The Cu20 simple oxide
The simple oxide Cu20 is reported to exhibit significant activity and selectiv- ity in the partial oxidation of propylene to acrolein [8] and has been often chosen as a model catalyst [14,97-102] for the determination of the involved reaction mechanisms.
On Cu20 powder obtained by CuO reduction at 400C, Boreskov et al.
[101,103] showed that propylene gives rise to reversible and irreversible ad- sorbed species: the former led to the partial oxidation products whereas the latter formed CO 2 and H20 [101]. An IR study suggests the formation of acrolein through the 'rr-allyl species intermediate [103]. On Cu20/MgO, the same group [98] observed both w- and -allyl species, the former being more stable (523-573 K) than the latter. The w-allyl species was assigned on the basis of the C=C stretch at 1510 cm J [98].Labelled molecule experiments over commercial Cu20 and impregnated Cu/o-A1203 by Imachi et al. [99] showed the existence of a primary kinetic isotopic effect for the production of two different forms of acrolein from CH3CH=CHD, suggesting an irreversible step for w-allyl to -allyl. Choi et al.

13 [97] compared the oxidation reactions of D and 180 labelled allyl alcohol and of CH3-CH=CHD over supported Cu20 and concluded that the o--allyl species was: (i) the intermediate precursor of acrolein formation from either propylene or allyl alcohol; (ii) was not in equilibrium with the 7r-allyl species in the reaction conditions. The last result is similar to that observed with the SbSnO system where the q-r o- interconversion was found irreversible [104] and similarly suggests the intervention of bridged lattice oxygen atoms (Cu-O-Cu) for the Cu20 catalyst [97]. In contrast, Akimoto et al. [105], using 1802 as an oxidant, concluded that adsorbed oxygen was incorporated into acrolein, not lattice oxygen.
Low surface area and unoriented Cu20 crystals have been studied in the propylene mild oxidation [100]. The obtained results showed that stoichiometric or copper rich Cu20 is the most active catalyst whereas oxygen rich Cu20 favors CO 2 and H20. On supported copper oxides it was also shown that Cu20 favors partial oxidation products whereas CuO favors non-selective oxidation [106].
Propylene oxidation was studied on Cu20 single crystal surfaces using XPS and TDS in ultra high vacuum after adsorption of propylene at 300 K and atmospheric pressure [14,107]. Three different Cu20 surfaces were examined: Cu  terminated (100) surface, oxygen terminated (100) surface and (111) surface with accessible copper cations and lattice oxygens. It was found that both selective and non-selective oxidation involved lattice oxygen atoms. In addition, the results indicated that the selective oxidation to acrolein was promoted by coordinately unsaturated surface lattice oxygen atoms but was not correlated to the oxygen coordination. Parallel experiments, using allyl alcohol and acrolein as probe molecules, showed that the propylene oxidation pathway proceeded through the (r-allyl species. In addition, contrasting with the above mentioned studies [99], the pathway:propylene  -allyl  o'-allyl was found reversible since propylene was obtained after allyl alcohol desorption [108]. This apparent contradiction probably came from the different operating conditions: reducing conditions (no oxygen cofeed) in the case of the Cu20 single crystal experiments [14] and oxidizing conditions (oxygen cofeed) in the case of Cu20 powder or Cu20/cA1203 [99]: concentration of the "rr and o--allyl species were probably controlled by kinetics and equilibria for the latter and the former cases, respectively [14].
3.2. Formation of acrylonitrile
Both oxidation and ammoxidation of propylene (Table 1) can be performed with the same catalytic systems to form acrolein and acrylonitrile, respectively [48,68,69,109,110]. The reaction temperature is generally higher for the ammox- 14

idation than for the oxidation of propylene [48,80]. Mechanisms of both reactions were extensively investigated, notably on the bismuth molybdate and the antimony oxide based catalysts [12,72,80-96,111-114].
The first step of propylene oxidation is the same, irrespective of the presence or the absence of ammonia and corresponds to the rate determining abstraction of the a-methyl hydrogen to form a w-allyl intermediate. The second step is the o--allyl intermediate formed by nitrogen insertion:
CH3CH=CH 3  (CH2:CH-CH2)  (CH2:CH-CH2N)

For the molybdate catalysts, ammonia is probably adsorbed as imido species [80] on which propylene should be adsorbed:

O=Mo=O  O=Mo=NH  HN=Mo=NH Adsorption of ammonia is irreversible at high temperature but not at low temperature. One ammonia molecule is adsorbed at low partial pressure of propylene whereas at high propylene pressure two ammonia molecules are adsorbed at the nitrogen insertion site per acrylonitrile formed. Labelled molecules experiments showed that or- and "u-allyl species interconvert re- versibly. The second hydrogen abstraction is the slow step in the conversion of the cr-nitrogen-allyl species to acrylonitrile and acrolein. However, the activa- tion energy for this step is higher for the o--oxygen-allyl species than for the o--oxygen-allyl, explaining the higher increase in selectivity with increasing temperature in ammoxidation.
For the antimonate based catalysts it was proposed that the active sites are composed of H-abstracting Sb3+-O groups and N-inserting SbS+-O bridging oxygens [80]:0

3.3. Formation of acrylic acid
The catalytic systems used for the partial oxidation of propylene to acrylic acid are mainly based on cobalt and nickel molybdates [115-120] and VPO mixed oxides [121] both modified by tellurium (Table 2). In fact, acrolein and

It appears from the literature data that these specific centers are those which adsorb and transform acrolein to acrylic acid, that is, oxidize the CHO group to the COOH group. In this connection, it has been observed that catalysts which oxidize o-xylene to tolualdehyde oxidize propylene to acrolein and those which produced phtalic anhydride from o-xylene also produced acrylic acid from propylene [122].
3.3.1. CoMoTeO catalysts
The cobalt molybdate prepared by co-precipitation and modified by TeO 2 led to CoMoTeO catalysts (Co/Mo = 2/3 to 1/1) highly selective for oxidation of propylene to acrylic acid [118]. With a mixture: air/propylene = 30/1 at 360C,the mean product is acrolein (98%) at low conversion and acrylic acid (39%) at high conversion.
The addition of water in the feed gas tended to decrease the activities and to increase the selectivity of organic products, notably that of acrylic acid. Typi- cally, with a mixture: air/propylene/water= 30/1/5 selectivities of 47% acrylic acid and 14% acrolein are found at 98% conversion. The decrease of activity was attributed to competitive adsorption between water and propylene and the increase of selectivities was attributed to an enhancement of the desorption rates of the products [118].
The kinetic study showed that acrylic acid is almost exclusively formed from acrolein, the initial product [118]. In analogy with the formation of acrolein from propylene on molybdate based catalysts [121] and with the formation of acrylic acid from acrolein on cobalt molybdate catalysts [123], it was proposed that the successive steps of the reaction take place on Mo vI and Co TM sites, respectively [118]. The role of the Te TM promoter should be to avoid the reduction of Co m to Co(II): Co H + Te

selective when it works in its oxidized form (O2/C3H6 >> 1) [124] but it is believed that the slight excess of MoO 3 plays an important role with its octahedral Mo sites [118,124]. The addition of TeO 2 does not provoke the apparition of a new phase and probably gives rise to solid solutions with the cobalt molybdate or with the molybdenum oxide in excess in the catalyst [125].
3.3.2. NiMoTeO catalysts
There is direct oxidation of propylene to acrylic acid on Ni-Mo-Te-O catalysts (Mo/Ni ca. 1.1, 7% Te2MoO 7) in the presence of water [119,120].
Prepared by different routes, the obtained catalysts were composed of microsys- terns of a-NiMoO 4 enriched with Te2MoO 7 resulting from the diffusion of this compound in the nickel molybdate matrix. Diffusion of Te2MoO 7 through the mass was favoured by the temperature and composition of the gas phase during the activation. The slight excess of molybdenum was also believed to favour controlled diffusion of the tellurium promoter. It is suggested that the oxidation of propylene to acrolein takes place on tellurium-rich sites whereas the subse- quent transformation of acrolein to acrylic acid and total oxidation occur on tellurium poor sites, but the mixing of the two phases seemed to enhance the catalytic efficiency of both. It was also observed that Te2MoO 7 accelerated the to [3-Ni-MoO 4 phase transformation (at 700C on heating in air) which led to a less active catalyst. The reverse process (o  [3) occurred at lower temperature (200C in air) and seemed to account for the break down of the granular catalyst structure observed.
3.3.3. VPTeO catalysts
The vapour phase oxidation of propylene was studied over V205, V205-P205 and V2Os-P2Os-TeO 2 catalysts in the presence of water [121]. On pure V205,the reaction mainly produces acetic acid and carbon oxides and small amounts of water. When the phosphorous content was increased the activity decreased whereas the selectivity to acrylic acid passed through a maximum (P/V =
1.15-1.60) and that to acetic acid gradually decreased. At the P/V = 1.15 ratio,
the yields of acrylic acid, acetic acid and acrolein were 25%, 10% and 0.7% respectively. The effect of the addition of TeO 2 to the VPO catalyst was complex: TeO 2 increased the specific oxidation activity as well as the sum of the yields of acrylic acid and acrolein while the yield of acetic acid passed through a maximum at Te

= 0.02-0.04. The yield of acrylic acid attained 38% (64% for COx) at 100% conversion in the case of VPTeO (Te/P/V =
0.15/1.15/1) catalyst.
Increasing the oxygen concentration in the feed gas, increased the conversion and the acrylic acid formation at the expense of acrolein formation but does not affect acetic acid formation. An increase of propylene concentration increased the formation of both acrolein and acetic acid at the expense of acrylic acid formation. As for the water content effect, it depended on the reaction condi-

17 tions. At high propylene conversion (98%) the increase of water concentration increased acrylic acid and acetic acid selectivities at the expense of acrolein. For example, the selectivities of acrolein, acrylic acid and acetic acid passed from 20%, 28% and 3% to 12%, 40% and 13% respectively at a constant level of conversion (98%).
The results were explained by the competition between the allylic oxidation and oxyhydration [ 126,127] of propylene to acrolein/acrylic acid and acetic acid respectively. i

The role of phosphorous should be to increase the catalyst surface acidity [121] and, in the present case, the resulting effect serves to promote the allylic oxidation relative to the oxyhydration of propylene. No clear correlation has been found between the presence of TeO 2 additive in the VPO oxide and the catalytic performances observed. Physical characterization of the VPTeO system should be useful to explain these results.
3.4. Conclusions
The oxidation and ammoxidation of propylene to acrolein was investigated on several systems, mainly BiMoO and SbSnO based mixed oxides and Cu20 simple oxide. The industrial formulations are mainly based on BiMoO mixed oxide modified by iron and cobalt. The lattice oxygen atoms participate to the reaction process. The reactive phases are most probably Mo=O and Bi-O-Mo containing phases for the BiMoO catalysts, Sn(Sb)O 2 and Sb204 phases for the SbSnO catalysts, and Cu  ions for the Cu20 catalysts. Ammonia is probably activated as metal amino (M-NH-M) or imido (M=NH) surface species. The rate determine step is the formation of the w-allyl species which transform into the o--allyl species then to acrolein or acrylonitrile. Acrylic acid and acrolein are obtained competitively when propylene is oxidized over Co(Ni)MoO and VPO mixed oxides modified by TeO 2, notably in presence of water.
4. The selective oxidation of propane
4.1. Oxydehydrogenation (ODHR) of propane to propylene over VMgO catalysts
Several processes of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane exist [1-7] but the drawbacks are in one hand the high temperature used due to the endothermicity of the reaction and, in the other hand, the rapid deactivation of the catalysts by coking. An attractive alternative is the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of 18

propane which is thermodynamically more favourable in a large range of temperature without carbon deposition. However, this catalysis requires rela- tively high temperatures for the propane activation (500-550C) and, moreover,the total oxidation is a possible secondary reaction. Thus, the challenge for the ODHR of propane is the design of catalysts working at temperatures as low as possible and avoiding the total oxidation of the initial products. A great variety of catalytic systems have been studied for this reaction [3,34,128-142] such as:alkali molten salts [3,126], metal molybdates [130,131] or vanadates [34,134- 142] niobium pentoxide [130]. We mainly discuss the VMgO system [134-142] which is reported to give the best performance (typically 60% of propane selectivity at 15% of propane conversion) and was subject of numerous studies.
4.1.1. Active phases and active sites
The nature of the active phase in this system is still discussed. According to Kung et al. [136,143] both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyro- vanadate (c-MgzV207) phases are selective in the partial oxidation of propane.
For Volta et al. [138] only the latter phase is responsible for the high propylene selectivities observed whereas the former is responsible for total oxidation. It seems that the differences of interpretation results from the presence or not of potassium impurities introduced during the catalyst preparation and which may modify the selectivities of the considered reaction [144]. In the same way, a recent study of Delmon's group [141] showed that the method of preparation of VMgO catalysts may also modify their performances due to formation of mixed phases which probably interact synergetically [141].The nature of the active sites of the VMgO catalysts is also still under debate [135,138-140,145]. According to Volta et al. [138,139] vanadium occupies isolated tetrahedral VO 4 sites in Mg 3V208, VO 6 octahedra linked through edges in a-MgV206 and V20 7 units consisting of pairs of corner-sharing VO 4 tetrahedra in c-MgV207. The obtained order of reactivity and selectivity for the phases were: c-MgzV207 > MgV206 > Mg3V208. From this result it was con- cluded that the active site included V-O-V bridge and short V--O bond simultaneously present in the V20 7 units of the cMg2V20 7 phase [138]. The short V=O bond is proposed to initiate the H abstraction step whereas the V-O-V bridge participates in the subsequent steps where water is formed. The V 4+ ions generated by water desorption should be stabilized in association with oxygen vacancies leading to structural changes from V207 units to two edge sharing square based VO 3 units [138,146]. This proposal is supported by the easier reducibility of the corresponding pyrovanade phase [ 139,141 ]. Due to the different reactivity orders obtained, Kung et al. [137] proposed the bridged oxygen atoms as selective sites for propylene and the terminal vanadyl species as responsible for total oxidation.It could be noted that in the case of supported vanadium oxides the obtained reactivity results allowed Corma et al. [140] to conclude that V-O bonds with
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48
19 vanadium in tetrahedral or octahedral coordination are responsible for selective oxidation to propylene whereas the presence of V-O bond near a V=O bond leads to more oxygenate product amounts.
4.1.2. Surface reducibility and basicity
A general agreement is that the reducibility of the catalyst plays an important role in the reaction course on the activation of propane [138,139,141,146,147].
In VMgO catalysts, where one V atom is replaced by one Mg atom, the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile and thus the catalyst surface is less reducible: these catalysts led to dominant propylene selectivity [35,138,140].
The basic catalyst surface has also been claimed [143,147-149] to increase the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes. Thus, on supported vana- dium or molybdenum oxides, it was shown that incorporating alkaline metals decreased both the conversion of propane and the yields of products but increased the selectivity of propylene at the expense of the selectivity of the CO x [150]. The reason should be that basic surfaces facilitate the desorption of alkenes, more basic compounds than the corresponding alkanes, thus preventing them from further oxidation to carbon oxides. It could be the case of the VMgO catalysts where the magnesia phase plays the role of basic centers during the propane partial oxidation to propylene [ 134-139].
However, the effect of the acid-base properties on selective oxidation of hydrocarbons is more complex since it should depend on the nature of the catalyst (and therefore on its oxidizing properties) and even, on the nature of the hydrocarbon molecules [135,151-154]. In addition, in the case of the propane molecule, the selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts.
The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst.
4.1.3. Reaction mechanisms and reaction intermediates
Concerning the reaction mechanism, a general agreement in literature is that the rate determining step of the reaction is the breaking of the first C-H bond,leading to a propyl species [32,156,157]. Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step. The surface reactivity of propylene produced should also be considered as selectivity determining [35].
The selective route to propylene should then be the breaking of the second C-H bond of the propyl species whereas the oxygenates (organic products or CO x) route should involve the insertion of the surface oxygen atom in the alkyl intermediate [35].
In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the 20

Mechanism of the oxydehydrogenation reaction of propane to propylene on VMgO catalysts. propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]. This radical species is then able to give propylene either after desorbing in the gas phase and reacting with gaseous oxygen or by a surface reaction [35,156,160,161 ]. Then the reaction course depends both on the reaction temper- ature and the nature of the catalyst [158,159,162]. High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and re- ducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]. So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface. Scheme 5 resumes these assump- tions.
It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane. This breaking should lead either to the formation a cation by hydride abstraction [164,165] or to the formation of a carbanion by proton abstraction [166-168]. The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts. In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activa- tion as shown below:

Other mechanistic schemes can be envisaged. A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds. In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step.
Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):
C3H8 [0] [C3H7OH] H
+ C3H 6 + H20
The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene. This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of 22

Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts. The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts.
4.1.4. Conclusion
In conclusion for the ODHR of propane to propylene, the most studied catalytic formulation VMgO system consists of a vanadia phase which provides the oxidizing properties needed and a magnesia phase which provides the base properties decreasing the propylene consecutive oxidation. It is proposed that high propylene selectivity needs both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites and the overall process is probably initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface.
4.2. Formation of acrolein
The catalytic systems tested in the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein are generally defect mixed oxides [19-22,170] in which the presence of vacancies are believed to promote the lattice oxygen mobility during the reaction. The best obtained formulations up to now are the BiMo(V)O multicomponent catalysts developed by Moro-oka et al. [19-21]. Several other formulations have also been tested [22-24].
4.2.1. BiMo(V)O catalysts
The most important results obtained by Moro-oka's group [20] are reported in Table 3. The main products are acrolein, propylene and carbon oxides. It is Table 3 Performances of modified BiMoO SV= 1800 ml g-l cat h-; C3H s catalysts in the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein (from Ref. [19]).

23 worthwhile to note that, in the operating conditions, the V-P-O catalysts, active in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride [31-33] do not give rise to acrolein and neither do the VMgO catalysts, active in the ODHR of propane to propylene [138]. The molybdenum component is necessary for good activity and good selectivity to acrolein but not the vanadium component (compare selectiv- ity of BiVO 4 relative to that of BiMoO or VMoO). The vanadium component rather increases the propane conversion (compare propane conversions for BiMoO and BiVMoO). The best formulation is Bi 1 -x/3 Vl-xMxO4 • A signifi- cant enhancement of the acrolein selectivity is observed by adding silver additive (compare selectivities for BiVMoO and AgBiVMoO). The optimization of the system shows that 65% of selectivity to acrolein with a propane conversion of 13% can be reached. Lithium and sodium behave also as promoting additives for acrolein formation whereas potassium, rubidium and tellurium mainly lead to propylene [20].
