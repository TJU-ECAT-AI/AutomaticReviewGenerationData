[1] "The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase."
[2] "The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing: (i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C; (ii) in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised;"
[3] "According to the authors, propyl radicals should be formed in the gas phase at high temperature in the pre-catalyst zone and then homogeneously converted to propylene."
[4] "These results seem to indicate that propylene was formed as primary product in the gas phase whereas acrolein was formed in the second step at the catalyst surface."
[5] "On the other hand, the observed selectivities, in fact, should partly reflect the ability of the considered scheelite type B-Mo-O catalysts to convert propylene to acrolein."
[6] "Two directions of improvement of the considered catalytic system emerge from the above results. The first one is the improvement of the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein in the overall process of partial oxidation of propane."
[7] "The observation of a homogeneous reaction in the pre-catalyst zone is in good accordance with previous works showing that non-catalytic vapour phase oxidation of propane takes place in the range 350-500C."
[8] "The main partial oxidation products are aldehydes (acrolein, propanal, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde) and methanol."
[9] "The most striking feature of the obtained performances is that they are similar to those obtained in the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein."
[10] "Ammonia seems either to inhibit the propylene gaseous formation or/and to promote its surface formation since conversions and selectivities to acrolein and acrylonitrile, respectively, are quite similar."
[11] "We think that this result should be associated to a competitive route of acrylonitrile formation through the oxyhydration of acrolein to acrylic acid or/and to a better desorption of adsorbed acrylonitrile in presence of an excess of water."
[12] "So there is a mutual influence between the acid-base and the oxidizing properties of the surface for the metal mixed oxides."
[13] "Indeed, in the case of propane ammoxidation on the BiMo(V)O scheelite type catalysts, ammonia seems to only provide nucleophilic surface species which attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to acetonitrile."
[14] "The situation is more complex. When the concentration of ammonia is increased in the propane feed gas for example, propane conversion and COx selectivity decrease, propylene selectivity increases whereas a maximum is observed for acrylonitrile selectivity."
[15] "The main route involves propylene intermediate for the BiMo(V)O, VSbO, NiMoTeO, CoMoTeO and VPTeO catalysts. Propylene production occurs on the surface of the catalysts except for the BiMo(V)O catalyst for which propylene is formed in the gas phase."
[16] "Propyl species are first formed (in analogy with the ODHR of propane to propylene) and that α- and β-allyl species are then successively formed (in analogy with the mechanisms of propylene oxidation to organic compounds)."
[17] "The role of water depends on the nature of the catalyst and even, probably, on the nature of the reaction. Indeed, in the case of propane ammoxidation on the BiMo(V)O scheelite type catalysts, ammonia seems to only provide nucleophilic surface species which attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to acetonitrile."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves considering the interactions among various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the intricate balance of catalyst properties, such as acidic, basic, and redox functionalities. The reaction mechanisms often involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, necessitating a specific surface structure to optimize selectivity.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing unwanted side reactions and enhancing the formation of desired products. Catalysts with well-defined acidic and basic sites are essential for the efficient activation of alkane molecules and the selective formation of organic compounds.

The intervention of acidic and basic pairs of sites during each elementary step is critical for achieving high selectivity in the overall oxidation process. This concerted action helps minimize activation energies and ensures a balanced reaction pathway.

Comparative studies of propane and propylene partial oxidation could provide insights into optimizing catalyst design and improving the overall process efficiency. Understanding the structure of the required surface and the mechanisms involved would enable the development of more active and selective catalysts for the partial oxidation of alkanes to valuable products.

Ammonia's role varies depending on the catalyst type and reaction context. In propane ammoxidation, ammonia provides nucleophilic surface species that attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to form acetonitrile. Increased ammonia concentration affects surface properties, influencing propane activation and product selectivity.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes requires a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and product selectivity. Addressing these challenges through detailed research and optimization efforts holds promise for advancing the technology and efficiency of alkane oxidation processes.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes faces challenges including high reaction temperatures due to endothermicity and rapid catalyst deactivation through coking. The process involves complex interactions between catalysts and the alkane molecules, requiring careful selection and optimization.

2. In the partial oxidation of propane, magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyrovanadate (c-MgzV207) phases have been found to selectively convert propane to propylene. The nature of the active sites within these phases is still under investigation.

3. Basic catalyst surfaces are claimed to enhance the selectivity of alkene formation during the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This is attributed to the ease of alkenes desorption compared to alkane molecules.

4. In vanadium magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts, the substitution of one vanadium atom with magnesium leads to a less reducible surface, which promotes the formation of propylene over other products. This highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility in alkane conversion.

5. For optimal performance, high propylene selectivity in propane conversion requires the presence of both vanadium-oxygen (V=O) and vanadium-oxygen-vanadium (V-O-V) isolated sites. The reaction initiates in the gas phase and concludes on the catalyst surface.

6. BiMo(V)O multicomponent catalysts have proven effective in the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein, showcasing their potential for efficient conversion. 

7. The molybdenum component is crucial for achieving both activity and selectivity in acrolein formation, whereas the vanadium component primarily affects the conversion efficiency rather than selectivity.

Answer: The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process. For instance, the nature of the active phase in the vanadium-magnesium oxide (VMgO) system is debated, with both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and pyrovanadate (c-MgzV207) being proposed as selective for the partial oxidation of propane. The basic surface of the catalyst is also claimed to increase alkene selectivity during the ODH of alkanes. In VMgO catalysts, the replacement of one vanadium atom by one magnesium atom makes the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom less mobile, leading to dominant propylene selectivity.

Site isolation, which refers to the ability of the catalyst to maintain distinct sites for different reactions, plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. For example, the less reducible surface of catalysts like VMgO, where the lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile, contributes to the high selectivity for propylene over other products.

Mechanisms proposed for the ODH of propane include both homolytic and heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond, leading to either a cation or a carbanion. A concerted mechanism is also suggested, where the transition state involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds, potentially lowering the energy barrier.

位点隔离，在这里指的是催化剂保持不同反应的不同位点的能力，对于解决选择性问题至关重要。例如，VMgO催化剂的较不可还原表面，其中涉及的晶格V-O-M氧原子移动性较低，有助于丙烯的选择性高过其他产物。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, involves a complex interplay between catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the proposed mechanisms. Catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise from the need for optimal balance among the acid-base, oxidizing, and reducing properties of the catalyst surfaces. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. Site isolation, which refers to the separation of functional groups on the catalyst surface, is critical for enhancing selectivity. 

For instance, the literature indicates that the reaction starts suddenly at 400°C, indicating the importance of temperature control. The conversion of propane decreases while the selectivity to acrolein increases with temperature, suggesting that the catalyst surface properties might change with temperature. The requirement for a certain concentration of propane and the impact of reactor volume demonstrate the sensitivity of the reaction to these parameters. The absence of acrolein in the presence of catalyst at 500°C in homogeneous propane oxidation further highlights the role of catalysts in influencing the reaction pathway. 

Overall, the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process hinges on a detailed understanding of the surface chemistry and the mechanisms governing the reaction, including the balance between the acid-base, oxidizing, and reducing properties of the catalysts. Comparative studies of propane and propylene oxidation could offer insights into optimizing the process. The literature underscores the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues and improving the overall efficiency of the process.

烷烃，尤其是丙烷的氧化脱氢涉及到催化剂性质、反应条件和提出机制之间复杂的相互作用。如块状金属氧化物和支持系统这样的催化剂在这一过程中扮演着关键角色。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战往往来自于催化剂表面性质需要达到最优平衡。提出的反应机制涉及C-H键的激活、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H的抽象。

例如，文献表明反应在400°C突然开始，表明温度控制的重要性。随着温度升高，丙烷的转化率降低而丙烯醛的选择性增加，这表明催化剂表面性质可能随温度变化。对一定浓度丙烷的要求以及反应器体积的影响显示了反应对这些参数的敏感性。在500°C下，没有催化剂存在时进行均相丙烷氧化并未检测到丙烯醛，进一步强调了催化剂在影响反应路径方面的作用。

总体而言，氧化脱氢过程的效率取决于对表面化学和指导反应机制的详细理解，包括催化剂酸碱、氧化和还原性质之间的平衡。比较丙烷和丙烯的氧化研究可能为优化过程提供见解。文献强调了在解决选择性问题和提高整体过程效率中，位点隔离的重要性。

The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase. The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing [19-21]:(i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C; (ii) in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised; (iii) a definite concentration of propane was required for the reaction to proceed: it was stopped either when the total concentration of propane and oxygen was lowered to 60% (propane oxygen = 0.55; T = 500C) or when the ratio propane/oxygen was lowered to 0.14 (propane + oxygen= 91%; T= 500oc); (iv) appreciable amounts of homogeneous propane oxidation (mainly to propylene) occurred at 500C in absence of the catalyst. No acrolein was detected in these conditions; (v) an effect of the reactor volume and of its empty zone on the reaction performance was observed, with and without the catalyst. For example no reaction was observed when the reactor volume was small with and without catalyst.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) involves a homogeneous auto-oxidation process in the gas phase. Key findings include the reaction initiating abruptly at 400°C, a decrease in propane conversion while acrolein selectivity increases with rising temperature, and the necessity of a certain propane concentration for the reaction to proceed. At 500°C, without a catalyst, noticeable propane oxidation to propylene occurs, but no acrolein is detected. Reactor volume and its empty space also impact reaction performance.

丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及在气相中进行的同质自氧化。关键发现包括反应在400°C突然开始，随着温度升高，丙烷转化率降低而乙醛选择性增加，以及一定的丙烷浓度对于反应进行是必要的。在500°C下，在没有催化剂的情况下，可以观察到明显的丙烷氧化为丙烯，但未检测到乙醛。反应器体积及其空隙区域也会影响反应性能。

From a practical point of view, two directions of improvement of the considered catalytic system emerge from the above results. The first one is the improvement of the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein in the overall process of partial oxidation of propane. In this sense, comparative studies of catalytic propane oxidation and propylene oxidation to acrolein should be of great interest and very useful. The second direction is the optimization of the reactor geometry in order to improve the first step of the considered reaction, i.e. the homogeneous ODHR of propane to propylene.

Practically speaking, two directions for enhancing the catalytic system are suggested by these results. The first involves refining the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein within the broader process of propane partial oxidation. Comparisons between catalytic propane oxidation and propylene oxidation to acrolein would be of great interest and utility. The second area for improvement is optimizing reactor design to enhance the initial step, namely the homogeneous oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

The main reason, as recalled in the introduction part, is the lesser reactivity of propane as compared to propylene reactivity: propane activation needs a higher reaction temperature (500C against 400C for propylene) and, as a consequence, strong activating phases such as vanadia. The difference of reactivity between propane and propylene is linked to the strengths of the involved C-H bonds and to the stability of the corresponding radicals formed in the rate determining step by H abstraction: the less stable propyl radical (corresponding to the stronger C-H bond) needs higher reaction temperatures and stronger oxidizing phases to be produced than the most stable "rr-allyl-radical (corresponding to the weaker C-H bond breaking).
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary reason, as mentioned earlier, is the lower reactivity of propane relative to propylene. Propane requires a higher reaction temperature (500°C compared to 400°C for propylene) for activation, necessitating stronger activating agents like vanadia. The disparity in reactivity stems from the strength of the involved C-H bonds and the stability of the radicals formed during the rate-limiting step by H abstraction: the less stable propyl radical (due to the stronger C-H bond) demands higher temperatures and stronger oxidizing phases to form compared to the most stable "α-allyl-radical", which corresponds to a weaker C-H bond breakage.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
主要原因是丙烷的活性低于丙烯。丙烷需要更高的反应温度（500°C与400°C的丙烯相比）来激活，因此需要更强的激活剂如钒亚。活性差异与参与的C-H键的强度和在H抽象的决定步骤中形成的相应自由基的稳定性有关：较不稳定的丙基自由基（对应于较强的C-H键）需要更高的温度和更强的氧化剂来形成，相比之下，最稳定的“α-烯丙基自由基”对应于较弱的C-H键断裂。

[1] "Several processes of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane exist [1-7] but the drawbacks are in one hand the high temperature used due to the endothermicity of the reaction and, in the other hand, the rapid deactivation of the catalysts by coking."
[2] "However, this catalysis requires relatively high temperatures for the propane activation (500-550C) and, moreover, the total oxidation is a possible secondary reaction."
[3] "Thus, the challenge for the ODHR of propane is the design of catalysts working at temperatures as low as possible and avoiding the total oxidation of the initial products."
[4] "A general agreement is that the reducibility of the catalyst plays an important role in the reaction course on the activation of propane [138,139,141,146,147]."
[5] "Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step."
[6] "In VMgO catalysts, where one V atom is replaced by one Mg atom, the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile and thus the catalyst surface is less reducible: these catalysts led to dominant propylene selectivity [35,138,140]."
[7] "The selective route to propylene should then be the breaking of the second C-H bond of the propyl species whereas the oxygenates (organic products or COx) route should involve the insertion of the surface oxygen atom in the alkyl intermediate [35]."
[8] "The C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,156,157]."
[9] "It is proposed that high propylene selectivity needs both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites and the overall process is probably initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
[10] "The best obtained formulations up to now are the BiMo(V)O multicomponent catalysts developed by Moro-oka et al. [19-21]."
[11] "The most important results obtained by Moro-oka's group [20] are reported in Table 3."
