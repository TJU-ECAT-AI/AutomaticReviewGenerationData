[1] "Several processes of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane exist [1-7] but the drawbacks are in one hand the high temperature used due to the endothermicity of the reaction and, in the other hand, the rapid deactivation of the catalysts by coking."
[2] "However, this catalysis requires relatively high temperatures for the propane activation (500-550C) and, moreover, the total oxidation is a possible secondary reaction."
[3] "Thus, the challenge for the ODHR of propane is the design of catalysts working at temperatures as low as possible and avoiding the total oxidation of the initial products."
[4] "A general agreement is that the reducibility of the catalyst plays an important role in the reaction course on the activation of propane [138,139,141,146,147]."
[5] "Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step."
[6] "In VMgO catalysts, where one V atom is replaced by one Mg atom, the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile and thus the catalyst surface is less reducible: these catalysts led to dominant propylene selectivity [35,138,140]."
[7] "The selective route to propylene should then be the breaking of the second C-H bond of the propyl species whereas the oxygenates (organic products or COx) route should involve the insertion of the surface oxygen atom in the alkyl intermediate [35]."
[8] "The C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,156,157]."
[9] "It is proposed that high propylene selectivity needs both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites and the overall process is probably initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
[10] "The best obtained formulations up to now are the BiMo(V)O multicomponent catalysts developed by Moro-oka et al. [19-21]."
[11] "The most important results obtained by Moro-oka's group [20] are reported in Table 3."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces challenges including high activation temperatures and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Efforts are made to develop catalysts that operate at lower temperatures and prevent total oxidation of the initial products.
2. Reducibility of the catalyst plays a crucial role in the activation of propane, affecting the reaction course and product selectivity.
3. Selectivity in the ODH of propane can be enhanced by controlling the activity of the propyl species formed during the first step of the reaction.
4. In vanadium magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts, replacing a vanadium atom with a magnesium atom results in a less mobile lattice oxygen atom, leading to increased propylene selectivity.
5. The selectivity route to propylene involves breaking the second C-H bond of the propyl species, while oxygenate formation typically requires the insertion of a surface oxygen atom into the alkyl intermediate.
6. The C-H bond breaking in propane is believed to occur homolytically, resulting in the formation of a propyl radical.
7. Achieving high propylene selectivity necessitates the presence of both vanadium-oxygen (V=O) and vanadium-oxygen-vanadium (V-O-V) isolated sites on the catalyst surface.
8. The overall ODH process is proposed to begin in the gas phase and complete on the catalyst surface.
9. The best catalyst formulations for the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein have been developed by Moro-oka et al., featuring bismuth-molybdenum-vanadium oxide (BiMo(V)O) systems.
10. Moro-oka's team has reported significant results in the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein using modified BiMoO catalysts, highlighting their performance and selectivity.
