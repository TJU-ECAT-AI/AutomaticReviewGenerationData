[1] "Several processes of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane exist but the drawbacks are in one hand the high temperature used due to the endothermicity of the reaction and, in the other hand, the rapid deactivation of the catalysts by coking."

[2] "The nature of the active phase in this system is still discussed. According to Kung et al. [136,143] both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyro vanadate (c-MgzV207) phases are selective in the partial oxidation of propane."

[3] "The basic catalyst surface has also been claimed [143,147-149] to increase the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes."

[4] "In VMgO catalysts, where one V atom is replaced by one Mg atom, the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile and thus the catalyst surface is less reducible: these catalysts led to dominant propylene selectivity [35,138,140]."

[5] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane. This breaking should lead either to the formation a cation by hydride abstraction [164,165] or to the formation of a carbanion by proton abstraction [166-168]."

[6] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."

Answer: The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process. For instance, the nature of the active phase in the vanadium-magnesium oxide (VMgO) system is debated, with both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and pyrovanadate (c-MgzV207) being proposed as selective for the partial oxidation of propane. The basic surface of the catalyst is also claimed to increase alkene selectivity during the ODH of alkanes. In VMgO catalysts, the replacement of one vanadium atom by one magnesium atom makes the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom less mobile, leading to dominant propylene selectivity.

Site isolation, which refers to the ability of the catalyst to maintain distinct sites for different reactions, plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. For example, the less reducible surface of catalysts like VMgO, where the lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile, contributes to the high selectivity for propylene over other products.

Mechanisms proposed for the ODH of propane include both homolytic and heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond, leading to either a cation or a carbanion. A concerted mechanism is also suggested, where the transition state involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds, potentially lowering the energy barrier.

Answer: 烷烃的氧化脱氢化（ODH）面临实现高选择性和转化率的挑战。催化剂在这一过程中起着关键作用。例如，在范德华-镁氧化物（VMgO）系统中，活性相的性质存在争议，镁三氧化二钒（Mg3V208）和焦钒酸镁（c-MgzV207）都被认为对丙烷的部分氧化具有选择性。催化剂表面的碱性也被宣称能增加烯烃的选择性，尤其是在烷烃的ODH反应中。

位点隔离，在这里指的是催化剂保持不同反应的不同位点的能力，对于解决选择性问题至关重要。例如，VMgO催化剂的较不可还原表面，其中涉及的晶格V-O-M氧原子移动性较低，有助于丙烯的选择性高过其他产物。

提出用于丙烷ODH的机制包括均裂和异裂C-H键的分裂，导致形成阳离子或碳负离子。也提出了协同机制，其中过渡态涉及化学键同时断裂和形成，可能降低能量壁垒。
