[1] "Several processes of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane exist but the drawbacks are in one hand the high temperature used due to the endothermicity of the reaction and, in the other hand, the rapid deactivation of the catalysts by coking."
[2] "The nature of the active phase in this system is still discussed. According to Kung et al. [136,143] both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyrovanadate (c-MgzV207) phases are selective in the partial oxidation of propane."
[3] "The basic catalyst surface has also been claimed [143,147-149] to increase the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes."
[4] "In VMgO catalysts, where one V atom is replaced by one Mg atom, the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile and thus the catalyst surface is less reducible: these catalysts led to dominant propylene selectivity [35,138,140]."
[5] "It is proposed that high propylene selectivity needs both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites and the overall process is probably initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
[6] "The best obtained formulations up to now are the BiMo(V)O multicomponent catalysts developed by Moro-oka et al. [19-21]."
[7] "The molybdenum component is necessary for good activity and good selectivity to acrolein but not the vanadium component (compare selectivities of BiVO4 relative to BiMoO or VMoO)."
[8] "Lithium and sodium behave also as promoting additives for acrolein formation whereas potassium, rubidium and tellurium mainly lead to propylene."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes faces challenges including high reaction temperatures due to endothermicity and rapid catalyst deactivation through coking. The process involves complex interactions between catalysts and the alkane molecules, requiring careful selection and optimization.

2. In the partial oxidation of propane, magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyrovanadate (c-MgzV207) phases have been found to selectively convert propane to propylene. The nature of the active sites within these phases is still under investigation.

3. Basic catalyst surfaces are claimed to enhance the selectivity of alkene formation during the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This is attributed to the ease of alkenes desorption compared to alkane molecules.

4. In vanadium magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts, the substitution of one vanadium atom with magnesium leads to a less reducible surface, which promotes the formation of propylene over other products. This highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility in alkane conversion.

5. For optimal performance, high propylene selectivity in propane conversion requires the presence of both vanadium-oxygen (V=O) and vanadium-oxygen-vanadium (V-O-V) isolated sites. The reaction initiates in the gas phase and concludes on the catalyst surface.

6. BiMo(V)O multicomponent catalysts have proven effective in the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein, showcasing their potential for efficient conversion. 

7. The molybdenum component is crucial for achieving both activity and selectivity in acrolein formation, whereas the vanadium component primarily affects the conversion efficiency rather than selectivity.

8. Promoting additives like lithium and sodium boost acrolein formation, while potassium, rubidium, and tellurium predominantly lead to propylene formation. This demonstrates the role of additives in controlling the reaction outcome.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢过程面临高温反应和催化剂快速焦化导致活性下降的挑战。该过程涉及催化剂与烷烃分子的复杂相互作用，需要精心选择和优化。

2. 在丙烷的部分氧化中，镁三钒酸盐（Mg3V208）和α-磷钒酸盐（c-MgzV207）相显示出对丙烷选择性转化成丙烯的能力。这些相中活性位点的性质仍在研究中。

3. 基质催化剂表面被认为能提高烷烯选择性，这是由于烷烯比烷烃更易于从表面脱附。这解释了为何基本面能够促进烷烯的选择性形成。

4. 在VMgO催化剂中，一个钒原子被镁替换后，表面的可还原性降低，促进了丙烯的选择性生成。这表明催化剂的可还原性对于烷烃转化至关重要。

5. 为了达到最佳性能，在丙烷转化中实现高丙烯选择性需要同时存在钒氧（V=O）和钒氧-钒（V-O-V）孤立位点。反应在气相开始并在催化剂表面完成。

6. BiMo(V)O多组分催化剂在丙烷直接氧化为丙烯醇方面表现出高效，展示了其在高效转化中的潜力。

7. 氧化钼是实现活性和选择性生成丙烯醇的关键因素，而钒成分主要影响转化效率而非选择性。

8. 添加剂如锂和钠能够增强丙烯醇的生成，而钾、铷和碲则主要导致丙烯的生成。这说明添加剂在控制反应结果方面的作用。
