[1] "The most studied catalytic formulation VMgO system consists of a vanadia phase which provides the oxidizing properties needed and a magnesia phase which provides the base properties decreasing the propylene consecutive oxidation."
[2] "In VMgO catalysts, where one V atom is replaced by one Mg atom, the involved lattice V-O-M oxygen atom is less mobile and thus the catalyst surface is less reducible: these catalysts led to dominant propylene selectivity."
[3] "The basic catalyst surface has also been claimed [143,147-149] to increase the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes."
[4] "It is proposed that high propylene selectivity needs both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites and the overall process is probably initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
[5] "The main products are acrolein, propylene and carbon oxides. It is noteworthy that, in the operating conditions, the V-P-O catalysts, active in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride [31-33] do not give rise to acrolein and neither do the VMgO catalysts, active in the ODHR of propane to propylene [138]."
[6] "The best formulation is Bi 1 -x/3 Vl-xMxO4 • A significant enhancement of the acrolein selectivity is observed by adding silver additive (compare selectivities for BiVMoO and AgBiVMoO)."

1. The vanadia phase in the VMgO system provides the oxidizing properties, while the magnesia phase supplies base properties to reduce propylene's consecutive oxidation. This leads to dominant propylene selectivity.

2. In VMgO catalysts, the less mobile V-O-M oxygen atom results in a less reducible catalyst surface, which leads to high propylene selectivity.

3. A basic catalyst surface is claimed to increase the alkene selectivity during the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

4. High propylene selectivity requires both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites. The process is initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface.

5. In the operating conditions, the V-P-O catalysts, active in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, do not produce acrolein, unlike the VMgO catalysts active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

6. Adding a silver additive significantly enhances the acrolein selectivity in the BiVMoO catalyst formulation.

1. VMgO系统中的氧化钒相提供氧化性质，而镁酸盐相提供碱性性质，减少丙烯连续氧化，导致主要选择性丙烯。

2. 在VMgO催化剂中，移动性较低的V-O-M氧原子导致催化剂表面的可还原性降低，从而产生高选择性的丙烯。

3. 基质催化剂表面被宣称在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中增加了烯烃的选择性。

4. 高选择性丙烯需要V=O和V-O-V孤立位点。整个过程在气相中开始，在催化剂表面上完成。

5. 在运行条件下，活性于丁烷氧化生成马来酸酐的V-P-O催化剂不产生丙烯醇，这与活性于丙烷氧化生成丙烯的VMgO催化剂不同。

6. 添加银添加剂显著提高了BiVMoO催化剂中丙烯醇的选择性。
