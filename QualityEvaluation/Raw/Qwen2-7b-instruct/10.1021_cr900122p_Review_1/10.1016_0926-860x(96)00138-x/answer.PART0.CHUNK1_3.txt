The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase. The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing [19-21]:(i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C; (ii) in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised; (iii) a definite concentration of propane was required for the reaction to proceed: it was stopped either when the total concentration of propane and oxygen was lowered to 60% (propane oxygen = 0.55; T = 500C) or when the ratio propane/oxygen was lowered to 0.14 (propane + oxygen= 91%; T= 500oc); (iv) appreciable amounts of homogeneous propane oxidation (mainly to propylene) occurred at 500C in absence of the catalyst. No acrolein was detected in these conditions; (v) an effect of the reactor volume and of its empty zone on the reaction performance was observed, with and without the catalyst. For example no reaction was observed when the reactor volume was small with and without catalyst.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) involves a homogeneous auto-oxidation process in the gas phase. Key findings include the reaction initiating abruptly at 400°C, a decrease in propane conversion while acrolein selectivity increases with rising temperature, and the necessity of a certain propane concentration for the reaction to proceed. At 500°C, without a catalyst, noticeable propane oxidation to propylene occurs, but no acrolein is detected. Reactor volume and its empty space also impact reaction performance.

丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及在气相中进行的同质自氧化。关键发现包括反应在400°C突然开始，随着温度升高，丙烷转化率降低而乙醛选择性增加，以及一定的丙烷浓度对于反应进行是必要的。在500°C下，在没有催化剂的情况下，可以观察到明显的丙烷氧化为丙烯，但未检测到乙醛。反应器体积及其空隙区域也会影响反应性能。

Regarding the selective oxidation of propane to valuable products (propylene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid), fairly good performances have been obtained, notably for acrylonitrile production: 65% of propylene selectivity at 15% of propane conversion over VMgO catalysts; 65% of acrolein selectivity at 15% of propane conversion over BiMo(V)O catalysts; 80% of acrylonitrile selectivity at 40% of propane conversion over VSbO catalysts.

For the selective oxidation of propane into valuable products including propylene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, and acrylic acid, satisfactory outcomes have been achieved. Notably, 65% propylene selectivity was recorded at 15% propane conversion with VMgO catalysts, 65% acrolein selectivity at 15% propane conversion with BiMo(V)O catalysts, and 80% acrylonitrile selectivity at 40% propane conversion with VSbO catalysts.

From a practical point of view, two directions of improvement of the considered catalytic system emerge from the above results. The first one is the improvement of the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein in the overall process of partial oxidation of propane. In this sense, comparative studies of catalytic propane oxidation and propylene oxidation to acrolein should be of great interest and very useful. The second direction is the optimization of the reactor geometry in order to improve the first step of the considered reaction, i.e. the homogeneous ODHR of propane to propylene.

Practically speaking, two directions for enhancing the catalytic system are suggested by these results. The first involves refining the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein within the broader process of propane partial oxidation. Comparisons between catalytic propane oxidation and propylene oxidation to acrolein would be of great interest and utility. The second area for improvement is optimizing reactor design to enhance the initial step, namely the homogeneous oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

从实际应用的角度来看，根据上述结果，有两种改进考虑的催化系统的方向。第一种是提高丙烯氧化成乙醛这一步骤在丙烷部分氧化过程中的效率。在这一意义上，比较催化丙烷氧化与丙烯氧化成乙醛的研究将非常有趣且有用。第二种改进方向是对反应器几何形状的优化，以改善考虑反应的第一步，即丙烷的均相氧化脱氢化成丙烯。

Water plays an important role in the catalytic selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Indeed, water is produced during the reaction, and, as such, should influence its course as reactant or/and the stability of active phase of the catalyst or that of the active sites.

The main reason, as recalled in the introduction part, is the lesser reactivity of propane as compared to propylene reactivity: propane activation needs a higher reaction temperature (500C against 400C for propylene) and, as a consequence, strong activating phases such as vanadia. The difference of reactivity between propane and propylene is linked to the strengths of the involved C-H bonds and to the stability of the corresponding radicals formed in the rate determining step by H abstraction: the less stable propyl radical (corresponding to the stronger C-H bond) needs higher reaction temperatures and stronger oxidizing phases to be produced than the most stable "rr-allyl-radical (corresponding to the weaker C-H bond breaking).

The primary reason, as mentioned earlier, is the lower reactivity of propane relative to propylene. Propane requires a higher reaction temperature (500°C compared to 400°C for propylene) for activation, necessitating stronger activating agents like vanadia. The disparity in reactivity stems from the strength of the involved C-H bonds and the stability of the radicals formed during the rate-limiting step by H abstraction: the less stable propyl radical (due to the stronger C-H bond) demands higher temperatures and stronger oxidizing phases to form compared to the most stable "α-allyl-radical", which corresponds to a weaker C-H bond breakage.

主要原因是丙烷的活性低于丙烯。丙烷需要更高的反应温度（500°C与400°C的丙烯相比）来激活，因此需要更强的激活剂如钒亚。活性差异与参与的C-H键的强度和在H抽象的决定步骤中形成的相应自由基的稳定性有关：较不稳定的丙基自由基（对应于较强的C-H键）需要更高的温度和更强的氧化剂来形成，相比之下，最稳定的“α-烯丙基自由基”对应于较弱的C-H键断裂。
