[1] "The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase."
[2] "The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing: (i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C;"
[3] "in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised;"
[4] "a definite concentration of propane was required for the reaction to proceed: it was stopped either when the total concentration of propane and oxygen was lowered to 60% (propane oxygen = 0.55; T = 500C) or when the ratio propane/oxygen was lowered to 0.14 (propane + oxygen= 91%; T= 500oc);"
[5] "an effect of the reactor volume and of its empty zone on the reaction performance was observed, with and without the catalyst."
[6] "These results seem to indicate that propylene was formed as primary product in the gas phase whereas acrolein was formed in the second step at the catalyst surface."
[7] "On the other hand, the observed selectivities, in fact, should partly reflect the ability of the considered scheelite type B-Mo-O catalysts to convert propylene to acrolein."
[8] "The observed yields and selectivities depended on the nature of the catalysts and on the reaction conditions (notably on the presence and concentration of water or/and ammonia)."
[9] "The role of water is linked to the presence of acid-base sites during the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons."
[10] "It is remarkable that BrSnsted acid sites are necessary to the formation of propylene but, also, to its degradation to CO, through the oxyhydration reaction."
[11] "There is a mutual influence between the acid-base and the oxidizing properties of the surface for the metal mixed oxides."
[12] "The effect of ammonia depends on the nature of the catalyst and even, probably, on the nature of the reaction."

1. The reaction is thought to occur partly through the homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane in the gas phase. 
2. The reaction began abruptly at 400°C. 
3. Contrary to expectations for hydrocarbon oxidation, propane conversion decreased slowly while the selectivity for acrolein increased when temperature rose.  
4. A certain propane concentration was necessary for the reaction to occur, ceasing when the total propane-oxygen ratio was lowered to 60% or the propane:oxygen ratio was reduced to 0.14.
5. Reactor volume and its empty space influenced reaction performance, whether with or without catalyst.
6. The results suggest propylene was the primary gas-phase product, while acrolein was formed on the catalyst surface.
7. Selectivities were partly due to the catalysts' ability to convert propylene to acrolein.
8. Catalyst nature and reaction conditions, including water and ammonia presence and concentration, affected yields and selectivities.
9. Water's role was connected to the presence of acid-base sites during hydrocarbon oxidation.
10. BrSnsted acid sites were essential for propylene formation but also contributed to its degradation via oxyhydration.
11. Acid-base and oxidizing surface properties of metal oxides influenced each other.
12. Ammonia's impact varied based on catalyst type and reaction nature.
