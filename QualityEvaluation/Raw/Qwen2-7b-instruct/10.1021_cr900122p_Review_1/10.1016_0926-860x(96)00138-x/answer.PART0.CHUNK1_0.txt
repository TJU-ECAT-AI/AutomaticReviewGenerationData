[1] "The reaction is believed to proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane occurring in the gas phase."
[2] "The given experimental evidences were the follow- ing: (i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C; (ii) in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised;"
[3] "According to the authors, propyl radicals should be formed in the gas phase at high temperature in the pre-catalyst zone and then homogeneously converted to propylene."
[4] "These results seem to indicate that propylene was formed as primary product in the gas phase whereas acrolein was formed in the second step at the catalyst surface."
[5] "On the other hand, the observed selectivities, in fact, should partly reflect the ability of the considered scheelite type B-Mo-O catalysts to convert propylene to acrolein."
[6] "Two directions of improvement of the considered catalytic system emerge from the above results. The first one is the improvement of the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein in the overall process of partial oxidation of propane."
[7] "The observation of a homogeneous reaction in the pre-catalyst zone is in good accordance with previous works showing that non-catalytic vapour phase oxidation of propane takes place in the range 350-500C."
[8] "The main partial oxidation products are aldehydes (acrolein, propanal, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde) and methanol."
[9] "The most striking feature of the obtained performances is that they are similar to those obtained in the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein."
[10] "Ammonia seems either to inhibit the propylene gaseous formation or/and to promote its surface formation since conversions and selectivities to acrolein and acrylonitrile, respectively, are quite similar."
[11] "We think that this result should be associated to a competitive route of acrylonitrile formation through the oxyhydration of acrolein to acrylic acid or/and to a better desorption of adsorbed acrylonitrile in presence of an excess of water."
[12] "So there is a mutual influence between the acid-base and the oxidizing properties of the surface for the metal mixed oxides."
[13] "Indeed, in the case of propane ammoxidation on the BiMo(V)O scheelite type catalysts, ammonia seems to only provide nucleophilic surface species which attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to acetonitrile."
[14] "The situation is more complex. When the concentration of ammonia is increased in the propane feed gas for example, propane conversion and COx selectivity decrease, propylene selectivity increases whereas a maximum is observed for acrylonitrile selectivity."
[15] "The main route involves propylene intermediate for the BiMo(V)O, VSbO, NiMoTeO, CoMoTeO and VPTeO catalysts. Propylene production occurs on the surface of the catalysts except for the BiMo(V)O catalyst for which propylene is formed in the gas phase."
[16] "Propyl species are first formed (in analogy with the ODHR of propane to propylene) and that α- and β-allyl species are then successively formed (in analogy with the mechanisms of propylene oxidation to organic compounds)."
[17] "The role of water depends on the nature of the catalyst and even, probably, on the nature of the reaction. Indeed, in the case of propane ammoxidation on the BiMo(V)O scheelite type catalysts, ammonia seems to only provide nucleophilic surface species which attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to acetonitrile."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves considering the interactions among various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the intricate balance of catalyst properties, such as acidic, basic, and redox functionalities. The reaction mechanisms often involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, necessitating a specific surface structure to optimize selectivity.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing unwanted side reactions and enhancing the formation of desired products. Catalysts with well-defined acidic and basic sites are essential for the efficient activation of alkane molecules and the selective formation of organic compounds.

The intervention of acidic and basic pairs of sites during each elementary step is critical for achieving high selectivity in the overall oxidation process. This concerted action helps minimize activation energies and ensures a balanced reaction pathway.

Comparative studies of propane and propylene partial oxidation could provide insights into optimizing catalyst design and improving the overall process efficiency. Understanding the structure of the required surface and the mechanisms involved would enable the development of more active and selective catalysts for the partial oxidation of alkanes to valuable products.

Ammonia's role varies depending on the catalyst type and reaction context. In propane ammoxidation, ammonia provides nucleophilic surface species that attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to form acetonitrile. Increased ammonia concentration affects surface properties, influencing propane activation and product selectivity.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes requires a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and product selectivity. Addressing these challenges through detailed research and optimization efforts holds promise for advancing the technology and efficiency of alkane oxidation processes.
