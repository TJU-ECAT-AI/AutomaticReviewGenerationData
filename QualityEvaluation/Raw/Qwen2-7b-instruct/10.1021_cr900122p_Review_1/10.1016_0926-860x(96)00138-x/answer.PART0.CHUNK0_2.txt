[1] "The most important results obtained by Moro-oka's group [20] are reported in Table 3. The main products are acrolein, propylene and carbon oxides."
[2] "The addition of water in the feed gas tended to decrease the activities and to increase the selectivity of organic products, notably that of acrylic acid."
[3] "The nature of the active phase in this system is still discussed. According to Kung et al. [136,143] both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyrovanadate (c-MgzV207) phases are selective in the partial oxidation of propane."
[4] "The basic catalyst surface has also been claimed [143,147-149] to increase the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes. Thus, on supported vanadium or molybdenum oxides, it was shown that incorporating alkaline metals decreased both the conversion of propane and the yields of products but increased the selectivity of propylene at the expense of the selectivity of the COx."
[5] "The nature of the active sites of the VMgO catalysts is also still under debate [135,138-140,145]. According to Volta et al. [138,139] vanadium occupies isolated tetrahedral VO4 sites in Mg3V208, VO6 octahedra linked through edges in a-MgV206 and V207 units consisting of pairs of corner-sharing VO4 tetrahedra in c-MgV207."
[6] "It is proposed that high propylene selectivity needs both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites and the overall process is probably initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
[7] "The main products are acrolein, propylene and carbon oxides."
[8] "The addition of water in the feed gas tended to decrease the activities and to increase the selectivity of organic products, notably that of acrylic acid."
[9] "The nature of the active sites of the VMgO catalysts is also still under debate [135,138-140,145]. According to Volta et al.

1. The main products obtained from the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are acrolein, propylene, and carbon oxides.
2. Adding water to the feed gas reduces the activity but increases the selectivity for organic products, notably acrylic acid.
3. Both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyrovanadate (c-MgzV207) phases are selective for propane oxidation according to Kung et al.'s findings.
4. Basic catalyst surfaces increase alkene selectivity in alkanes' oxidative dehydrogenation. Incorporating alkaline metals decreases propane conversion and product yields but boosts propylene selectivity.
5. Vanadium in VMgO catalysts occupies isolated tetrahedral VO4 sites in Mg3V208, VO6 octahedra linked through edges in a-MgV206, and V207 units with pairs of corner-sharing VO4 tetrahedra in c-MgV207, as stated by Volta et al.
6. High propylene selectivity necessitates both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites, and the process is initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface.
