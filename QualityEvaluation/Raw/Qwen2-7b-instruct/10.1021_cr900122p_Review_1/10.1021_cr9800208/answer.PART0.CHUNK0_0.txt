[1] "The function of niobium compounds in catalysis can be that of promoter or active phase, support, solid acid catalyst, or redox material."
[2] "Niobium oxide has been used as an oxide support for such metals as Ru, Rh, Pt, Re, Ni, Cr, W, Co, V, P, Ge, Mo, Sb, Pb, Bi, and Fe."
[3] "When used in this manner, the properties of the niobia are improved by the addition of these elements, while its high selectivity is still maintained."
[4] "Niobia catalysts may contain niobium oxide as a two-dimensional niobium oxide overlayer (surface niobia species), an oxide support (niobia-supported surface redox sites), or as mixed oxides (a solid solution or compound of niobium oxide)."
[5] "Niobium compounds and materials are becoming important as catalysts for various reactions, and interest in them is growing."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a challenging process due to the need for high selectivity and conversion, often requiring the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges include the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H, which collectively influence process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by creating distinct environments for reaction steps, thus preventing unwanted side reactions and promoting the desired transformation.

氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）是一个具有挑战性的过程，因为需要高转化率和选择性，通常需要各种催化剂的协同作用，包括单体金属氧化物和负载系统。挑战包括C-H键的激活、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H的抽象，这些因素共同影响过程效率。通过隔离反应位点，可以解决选择性问题，从而创建不同的环境来促进所需转换，同时防止不希望的副反应。
