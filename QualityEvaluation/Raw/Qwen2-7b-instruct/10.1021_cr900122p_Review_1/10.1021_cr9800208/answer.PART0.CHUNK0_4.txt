[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O)."
[2] "Since ethane is the second most major component of natural gas and is also a main product in many methane-coupling reactions, its transformation to ethene at low temperature is of considerable interest."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a process that converts alkanes into alkenes efficiently. Ethane, being a significant component of natural gas and a product in methane-coupling reactions, is of interest for its transformation to ethene at low temperatures. Niobium oxide, when treated at 373 K, demonstrates high Brnsted acidity and can act as an effective catalyst for acid-catalyzed reactions under mild conditions. Studies have shown that a mixture of molybdenum, vanadium, and niobium oxides in a specific ratio (19:5:1) provides an active and selective catalyst. Moreover, niobium oxide-supported catalysts exhibit higher activity in the hydrogenolysis of ethane compared to pure titanium oxide and aluminum oxide.

氧化脱氢化（ODH）是将烷烃转化为烯烃的一种能效较高的途径。乙烷作为天然气的主要成分之一，在甲烷耦合反应中的主要产物，其在低温下转化为乙烯具有重要价值。当铌酸盐在373 K下处理后，显示出强的布恩斯特酸性，并可以作为温和条件下酸催化反应的有效催化剂。研究表明，钼、钒和铌氧化物以特定比例（19:5:1）混合使用时，能够提供活性和选择性的催化剂。此外，铌酸盐支持的催化剂在乙烷氢解反应中的活性高于纯二氧化钛和氧化铝。
