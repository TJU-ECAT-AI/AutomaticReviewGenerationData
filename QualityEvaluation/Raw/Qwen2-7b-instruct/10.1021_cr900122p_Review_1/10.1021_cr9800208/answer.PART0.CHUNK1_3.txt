[1] "The reactivity of a series of amines having various structures and different numbers of hydrogen atoms on the α- and β-carbon atoms was examined by Cattenot et al. using four transition metal sulfides: NbS3, MoS2, RuS2, and Rh2S3."
[2] "In the HDN of pyridine, niobium trisulfide is slightly more active than MoS2."
[3] "The stability of the niobium trisulfide catalyst toward reduction depended on the H2S partial pressure under the test conditions."
[4] "The catalytic activity of an unsupported mixed NiNb sulfide was similar to that observed for NiMoS."
[5] "In the n-pentylamine conversion, the rate of C5 hydrocarbon formation is much higher on niobium sulfide than on molybdenum sulfide and does not vary when the H2S partial pressure is increased 10-fold."

1. Cattenot et al. studied the reactivity of amines using four transition metal sulfides: NbS3, MoS2, RuS2, and Rh2S3.

2. Niobium trisulfide shows slightly higher activity than molybdenum disulfide in the hydrogenation dealkylation (HDN) of pyridine.

3. The stability of the niobium trisulfide catalyst is influenced by the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) partial pressure under test conditions.

4. The mixed NiNb sulfide catalyst had similar activity to the NiMoS catalyst.

5. The rate of pentyl hydrocarbon formation from n-pentylamine is significantly faster with niobium sulfide compared to molybdenum sulfide, and this rate remains unchanged when the H2S partial pressure is increased 10 times.

1. 卡特诺等研究了一系列具有不同结构和α-、β-碳原子上不同氢原子数的胺的反应性，使用了四种过渡金属硫化物：NbS3、MoS2、RuS2 和 Rh2S3。

2. 在吡啶的氢化脱烷基（HDN）过程中，铌三硫化物的活性略高于钼硫化物。

3. 铌三硫化物催化剂的稳定性受测试条件下氢硫化物（H2S）分压的影响。

4. 混合NiNb硫化物催化剂的活性与NiMoS相似。

5. n-戊基胺转化为戊基烃的速率在铌硫化物中明显更快，而在钼硫化物中的速率较低。当增加H2S分压10倍时，这种速率保持不变。
