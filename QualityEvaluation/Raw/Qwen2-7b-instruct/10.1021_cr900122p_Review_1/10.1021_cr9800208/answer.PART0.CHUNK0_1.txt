The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the conversion of hydrocarbons into alkenes, typically in the presence of oxygen. This process is crucial for the production of alkenes, which are essential feedstocks in the chemical industry. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a significant role in the efficiency of this reaction. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complexity of the reaction pathways, which involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The role of site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating reaction sites, the catalysts can prevent unwanted side reactions, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process. For instance, the presence of surface niobia species on titania catalysts can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity, while generating dual sites on the surface can lead to a substantial increase in the turnover frequency (TOF) of the SCR process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及将碳氢化合物转化为烯烃，通常在氧气的存在下。这一过程对烯烃的生产具有高度的能效吸引力，是化学工业中关键的步骤。各种催化剂，包括单质金属氧化物和负载系统，在提高反应效率方面起着重要作用。在实现高选择性和转化率的过程中，面临的挑战主要源于反应途径的复杂性，涉及C-H键的活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H的抽取。通过隔离反应位点，催化剂可以防止不必要的副反应，从而提高氧化脱氢过程的整体效率。例如，在钛酸盐催化剂上存在的表面铌酸盐物种可以增强催化活性和选择性，而生成表面双位点可以导致选择性催化还原过程的显著提高。
