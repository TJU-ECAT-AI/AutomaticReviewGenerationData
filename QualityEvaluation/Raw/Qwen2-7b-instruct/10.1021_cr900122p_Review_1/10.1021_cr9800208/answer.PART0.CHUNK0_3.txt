[1] "Nickel niobate (NiNb2O6) supported on SiO2 showed a TOF (turnover frequency) in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene101 similar to that of Pt/Nb2O5 at the highest platinum loading but produced a higher selectivity for benzene (100%). These results demonstrate that selectivity is improved by the NiNb interaction."
[2] "The presence of all three oxides is necessary in order to have an active and selective catalyst. The best results, according to Somorjai et al., 142 have been obtained using a mixture with a MoVNb ratio of 19:5:1. Their studies suggest that the active phase is based on molybdenum and vanadium. Niobium enhances the intrinsic activity of this combination and improves the reaction selectivity by inhibiting the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[3] "The influence of the surface metal oxide and acid species of surface-modified niobium oxide catalysts with low loading (1 wt %) on the catalytic activity and selectivity obtained during methanol oxidation was studied by Jehng et al.108 (Table 5). The niobia's surface phosphate and sulfate species increase the methanol conversion and induce 100% selectivity to the dehydration product CH3OCH3."
[4] "The addition of niobia to the most commonly used metal oxide, FeOx, causes a remarkable enhancement of the SCR activity, such that the conversion reaches 90% at 573 K."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the need for both redox and acidic sites on the catalytic surface, which often conflict in terms of reactivity and stability. The role of niobium in catalysts such as NiNb2O6, MoVNb, and Pt/Nb2O5 highlights the importance of synergistic interactions between metals. For instance, the NiNb interaction enhances selectivity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene, while the MoVNb ratio of 19:5:1 demonstrates the necessity of all three oxides for an active and selective catalyst. Niobium, in particular, can inhibit the total oxidation of ethane, contributing to improved selectivity.

In methanol oxidation, surface niobium oxide species, especially those in the form of phosphate and sulfate, can increase conversion and induce 100% selectivity to the dehydration product CH3OCH3. This showcases the impact of niobium's acidic properties in controlling the reaction pathway and enhancing selectivity.

In the context of selective catalytic reduction (SCR), the addition of niobium to common metal oxides like FeOx can significantly boost activity, reaching 90% conversion at 573 K. This exemplifies how niobium can be used to optimize catalyst performance in addressing selectivity issues.

Collectively, these factors—metal interactions, acidic properties, and site isolation—play crucial roles in influencing the efficiency of ODH processes. Niobium's multifaceted contributions, from enhancing activity to improving selectivity, underscore its potential in optimizing catalyst design for alkanes transformations.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及复杂催化剂之间的相互作用，包括单质金属氧化物和负载系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于催化表面需要同时具备还原性和酸性位点，这些位点在反应活性和稳定性方面往往存在冲突。NiNb、MoVNb和Pt/Nb2O5中铌的存在表明不同金属之间协同作用的重要性。例如，NiNb的结合可以提高环己烷脱氢到苯的产物选择性，而MoVNb比例为19:5:1则说明所有三种氧化物对于活性和选择性催化剂的必要性。铌特别能够抑制乙烷的完全氧化，从而提高选择性。

在甲醇氧化过程中，表面铌氧化物物种，尤其是磷酸盐和硫酸盐形式，可以增加转化率并诱导100%选择性到脱水产物CH3OCH3。这展示了铌的酸性性质如何控制反应路径并增强选择性。

在选择性催化还原（SCR）的背景下，向常见金属氧化物如FeOx添加铌可以显著提升活性，达到90%转化率在573 K。这说明铌可用于优化催化剂设计以解决选择性问题。

总体而言，金属相互作用、酸性特性和位点隔离等因素共同影响烷烃转换过程的效率。铌的多面贡献，从提高活性到改善选择性，强调了其在优化催化剂设计方面的潜力。
