The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process involves the use of various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to convert alkanes into alkenes. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include complex reaction pathways and the formation of unwanted byproducts. Catalysts like niobium trisulfide (NbS3) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have been studied for their ability to activate C-H bonds and generate alkyl intermediates, leading to the formation of alkenes. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction environment to specific regions of the catalyst surface, thus enhancing the desired reaction pathway and reducing byproduct formation. The Lewis acidity of the catalyst surface, particularly in niobium oxide catalysts containing 5 wt% Nb2O5, is critical for maximizing the rates of sulfur and nitrogen removal in hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) processes. Additionally, the development of catalysts capable of efficiently decomposing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) into harmless compounds is essential for reducing global environmental pollution. Obtaining high selectivity in the conversion of alcohols to thiol compounds, especially in the presence of sulfur and oxygen-containing compounds, remains a significant challenge. The use of niobium-containing molecular sieves, such as MCM-41, with optimized silicon-to-niobium ratios can exhibit high selectivity in the synthesis of methanethiol, even under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, niobium catalysts can be utilized in photooxidized processes, suggesting their potential in applications requiring light-driven reactions.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及使用各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载系统，将烷烃转化为烯烃。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括复杂的反应途径和副产品的形成。像铌三硫化物（NbS3）和钼二硫化物（MoS2）这样的催化剂已被研究用于激活C-H键并生成烷基中间体，导致烯烃的形成。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过将反应环境限制在催化剂表面的特定区域，从而增强所需反应路径并减少副产物的形成。特别是对于铌氧化物催化剂含有的5wt% Nb2O5表面的Lewis酸性，对于最大化硫和氮在氢化氮过程中去除速率至关重要。此外，高效分解氯氟碳化合物（CFCs）以生成无害化合物对于减少全球环境污染是必要的。获得高选择性的醇到硫醇转化，尤其是在存在硫和氧含化合物的情况下，仍然是一个重大挑战。使用硅与铌比优化的MCM-41型分子筛，可以表现出在温和反应条件下高选择性合成甲硫醇的能力。此外，铌催化剂可以用于光氧化化过程，表明它们在需要光驱动反应的应用中有潜力。
