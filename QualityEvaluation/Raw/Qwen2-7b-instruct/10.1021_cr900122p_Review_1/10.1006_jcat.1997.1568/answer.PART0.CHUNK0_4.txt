[1] "In the area of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, several systems have emerged in recent years holding some promise for further study and development, particularly when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane."
[2] "Vanadium based systems activate propane at fairly low temperatures (down to 400C), and it has been proposed that their effectiveness might stem from the metalloradical character of vanadium."
[3] "Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."
[4] "The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields."
[5] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiCo molybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."
[6] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion involve understanding the intricate interplay between catalyst properties and reaction kinetics. For instance, the use of metal molybdates, which exhibit high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperatures, offers an alternative to vanadium-based catalysts. This highlights the importance of catalyst design in enhancing the efficiency of ODH processes. The role of site isolation becomes critical in addressing selectivity issues, as it helps in controlling the reaction pathways and improving product purity. Redox elements such as vanadium, iron, cerium, and chromium can enhance the activity of NiCo molybdates, especially chromium, which retains high selectivity even at higher conversions, thus potentially enabling lower process temperatures. This suggests that the choice of catalyst components significantly influences the overall process efficiency in ODH reactions.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的分析中，各种催化剂，包括单体金属氧化物和支撑系统，在过程中扮演着至关重要的角色。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战涉及到理解催化剂特性和反应动力学之间的复杂互动。例如，使用钼酸盐金属，由于它们在相对较低温度下表现出对丙烷激活的高活性，为基于钒的催化剂提供了替代方案。这强调了催化剂设计在提高ODH过程效率中的重要性。隔离站点的作用变得至关重要，因为它有助于控制反应途径并改善产品纯度。还原剂元素如钒、铁、铈和铬可以增强NiCo钼酸盐的活性，尤其是铬，即使在更高的转化率下也能保持高选择性，因此有可能降低过程温度。这表明催化剂组分的选择显著影响ODH反应的整体过程效率。
