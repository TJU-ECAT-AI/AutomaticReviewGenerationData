          [1] "More recently (2), research aims have shifted from functionalizing olefins to functionalizing the more abundant and less expensive paraffinic feedstocks, in an effort to meet future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs."
          [2] "In the area of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, several systems have emerged in recent years holding some promise for further study and development, particularly when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane."
          [3] "Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."
          [4] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."
          [5] "The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields."
          [6] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiCo molybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

          Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts including metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this field often involve understanding complex reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation being key to addressing selectivity issues. Metal molybdates, especially those based on nickel and cobalt, show promise as alternatives to vanadium-based catalysts for activating light paraffins. They demonstrate high activity at relatively low temperatures, making them suitable for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor, potentially with a second component consisting of well-known olefin-converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdates.

          在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的研究中，各种催化剂，包括金属氧化物和支持系统，在实现高选择性和转化方面起着关键作用。这一领域的挑战经常涉及理解复杂的反应机制，如C-H键活化、形成M-烷基中间体和2H抽取。这些因素共同影响过程效率，位点隔离是解决选择性问题的关键。镍和钴基钼酸盐作为基于钒的催化剂的替代品显示出对轻质烷烃激活的潜力，尤其是在相对较低的温度下表现出高活性，这使得它们适合在单个反应器中直接将丙烷转化为丙烯酸或丙烯腈，并且可能与包含已知多组分混合金属钼酸盐的第二部分组合，用于催化烯烃生成。

          In the context of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, the development of effective catalysts is essential for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Metal molybdates, particularly those based on nickel and cobalt, have shown promise due to their ability to activate propane at relatively low temperatures. The choice of metal and the surface area of the catalyst significantly affect propane conversion and the yield of propylene. The addition of redox elements like vanadium, iron, cerium, and chromium can enhance the activity of NiCo molybdates, with chromium showing particular promise in retaining high selectivity at higher conversion rates, which may lead to the possibility of operating at lower process temperatures.

          在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的背景下，有效催化剂的发展对于实现高选择性和转化至关重要。基于镍和钴的金属钼酸盐显示出潜力，因为它们能够在相对较低的温度下激活丙烷。所选金属和催化剂的表面积显著影响丙烷转化和丙烯产量。添加还原剂元素如钒、铁、铈和铬可以增强NiCo钼酸盐的活性，特别是铬在更高转化率下保留高选择性，这可能导致操作温度降低的可能性。
