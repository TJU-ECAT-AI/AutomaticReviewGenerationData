[1] "In the area of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, several systems have emerged in recent years holding some promise for further study and development, particularly when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane."
[2] "Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."
[3] "While Hardman (10) studied primarily CoMoO4 based catalysts for the oxydehydration of propane to propylene, and Mazzochia et al. (11) primarily NiMoO4, we undertook a broader investigation of propane oxydehydrogenation, studying single and binary molybdates of the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn; some ternary molybdates of the for- mulaNi0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4,whereX = P,Bi,Fe,Cr,V,and Ce; and systems of the formula Ni0.5Co0.5Y0.002MoO4, where Y = K or Cs."
[4] "Propane conversion and yields of propylene produced vary greatly with the choice of the A metal of the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst."
[5] "The effect is largest for the Nimolybdate system whose optimum lies at stoichiometry. The optimum activity of Comolybdate lies at molybdenum lean compositions."
[6] "Binary NiComolybdates are less sensitive to molybdenum level, offering a conveniently stable catalytic system for further mechanistic and technological optimization studies."
[7] "Ad- dition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a pos- sibility for desired lower process temperature operation."
[8] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."
[9] "Futuristically,it holds promise as the paraffin activating component of a two com- ponent catalyst system for the direct conversion, in a single reactor,of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile, with the second compo- nent being composed of one of the well known olefin converting,multicomponent mixed metal molybdates."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include understanding the reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by affecting the rate of reaction, energy consumption, and product purity. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the active sites of the catalyst are isolated from other reactive species, thus enhancing the specificity of the reaction towards the desired product.

2. The use of metal molybdates, particularly those based on nickel and cobalt, shows promise in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their ability to activate propane at relatively low temperatures. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on the choice of metal and the surface area of the catalyst. Binary and ternary molybdate compositions can offer optimized activity and selectivity, depending on the specific conditions and desired product.

3. The addition of redox elements like vanadium, iron, cerium, and chromium to nickel-cobalt molybdate systems can enhance their activity, with chromium showing particular promise due to its ability to retain high selectivity at higher conversion rates. This suggests that chromium could enable a reduction in the operating temperature of the process, potentially leading to energy savings and improved efficiency.

4. The nickel-cobalt molybdate system represents an alternative to vanadium-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins. This system could be integrated into a two-component catalyst system for the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor. The second component of such a system would likely consist of a well-known olefin-converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdate, enabling a comprehensive approach to the conversion of propane into valuable organic compounds.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢涉及到各种催化剂，包括本体金属氧化物和负载型系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战包括理解反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽取。这些因素共同影响过程效率，通过影响反应速率、能量消耗和产品纯度来影响。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，确保催化剂活性位点与其它反应性物种分离，从而增强对目标产物的特异性。

2. 金属钼酸盐，特别是镍和钴基的，显示出在低温度下激活丙烷的潜力，在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中具有应用前景。催化剂的有效性取决于所选金属和催化剂的表面积。二元和三元钼酸盐组成可以提供优化的活性和选择性，具体取决于特定条件和所需产物。

3. 将还原性元素如钒、铁、铈和铬添加到镍钴钼酸盐系统中可以增强其活性，其中铬特别有希望，因为它能够在较高转化率下保持高选择性。这表明铬可能允许过程温度的降低，从而可能带来能效提升和成本节约。

4. 镍钴钼酸盐系统代表了与基于钒的催化剂相比，用于轻质烷烃活化的替代方案。该系统可以集成到单个反应器中的双组分催化剂系统中，直接将丙烷转化为丙烯酸或丙烯腈。该系统的第二部分很可能由一种已知的多组分混合金属钼酸盐组成，用于催化烯烃生成，从而提供全面的方法来将丙烷转化为有价值的有机化合物。
