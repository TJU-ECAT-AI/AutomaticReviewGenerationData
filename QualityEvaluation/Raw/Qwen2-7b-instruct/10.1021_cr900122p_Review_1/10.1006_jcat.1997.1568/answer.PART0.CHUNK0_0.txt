[1] "Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."
[2] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."
[3] "Propane conversion and yields of propylene produced vary greatly with the choice of the A metal of the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst."
[4] "At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."
[5] "The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields. The effect is largest for the Nimolybdate system whose optimum lies at stoichiometry. The optimum activity of Comolybdate lies at molybdenum lean compositions."
[6] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts including metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion involve intricate interactions among catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the chemistry of alkane activation. Catalysts like metal molybdates show promise due to their ability to activate alkanes at relatively low temperatures, comparable to vanadium-based systems. The interplay between metal composition, particularly nickel and cobalt, affects the efficiency of the process. Site isolation within the catalyst structure appears to enhance selectivity, allowing for more controlled activation of specific alkane functions. The molybdenum content significantly influences activity and product yields, with optimal performance often found at stoichiometric ratios. Redox elements, such as chromium, when added to nickel-cobalt molybdates, improve activity while maintaining selectivity at higher conversions, potentially enabling operation at lower temperatures. Overall, these factors collectively shape the process efficiency, with careful selection and tuning of catalyst properties critical for achieving desired outcomes in ODH reactions.
