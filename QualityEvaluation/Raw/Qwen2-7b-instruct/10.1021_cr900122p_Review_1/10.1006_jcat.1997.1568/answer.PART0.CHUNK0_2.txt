[1] "More recently (2), research aims have shifted from functionalizing olefins to functionalizing the more abundant and less expensive paraffinic feedstocks, in an effort to meet future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs."
[2] "One of the newer approaches has been selective oxydehydrogenation of lower alkanes, a two-electron oxidation, to functionalize parafins to the corresponding olefins."
[3] "Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."
[4] "While Hardman (10) studied primarily CoMoO4 based catalysts for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and Mazzochia et al. (11) primarily NiMoO4, we undertook a broader investigation of propane oxydehydrogenation, studying single and binary molybdates of the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn; some ternary molybdates of the for- mulaNi0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4,whereX = P,Bi,Fe,Cr,V,and Ce; and systems of the formula Ni0.5Co0.5Y0.002MoO4, where Y = K or Cs."
[5] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."
[6] "Futuristically,it holds promise as the paraffin activating component of a two component catalyst system for the direct conversion, in a single reactor,of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile, with the second component being composed of one of the well known olefin converting,multicomponent mixed metal molybdates."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts including metal oxides and supported systems are employed to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in achieving these objectives often involve intricate reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These mechanisms play critical roles in determining process efficiency. Site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues, allowing for targeted reactions and minimizing unwanted side products. Metal molybdates, especially those based on nickel and cobalt, show promising alternatives to vanadium-based catalysts for activating light paraffins. They possess the capability to function within a two-component catalyst system for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile, showcasing their potential for efficient and integrated chemical production processes.
