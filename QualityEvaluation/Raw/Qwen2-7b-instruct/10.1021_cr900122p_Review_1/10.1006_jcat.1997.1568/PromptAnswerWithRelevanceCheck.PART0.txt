[1] "Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."
[2] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."
[3] "Propane conversion and yields of propylene produced vary greatly with the choice of the A metal of the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst."
[4] "At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."
[5] "The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields. The effect is largest for the Nimolybdate system whose optimum lies at stoichiometry. The optimum activity of Comolybdate lies at molybdenum lean compositions."
[6] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), various catalysts including metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion involve intricate interactions among catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the chemistry of alkane activation. Catalysts like metal molybdates show promise due to their ability to activate alkanes at relatively low temperatures, comparable to vanadium-based systems. The interplay between metal composition, particularly nickel and cobalt, affects the efficiency of the process. Site isolation within the catalyst structure appears to enhance selectivity, allowing for more controlled activation of specific alkane functions. The molybdenum content significantly influences activity and product yields, with optimal performance often found at stoichiometric ratios. Redox elements, such as chromium, when added to nickel-cobalt molybdates, improve activity while maintaining selectivity at higher conversions, potentially enabling operation at lower temperatures. Overall, these factors collectively shape the process efficiency, with careful selection and tuning of catalyst properties critical for achieving desired outcomes in ODH reactions.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it is evident that the field has shifted focus from olefin functionalization to paraffin activation due to the abundance and cost-effectiveness of paraffins. This shift aims to cater to future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs. Researchers have explored multiple systems for paraffin oxydehydrogenation, particularly targeting propane, i-butane, and n-butane. A broad investigation of molybdate catalysts, including single and binary molybdates of the formula AMoO4 (where A is Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn), ternary molybdates, and systems with a mix of metals like Ni and Co, has been conducted. These studies suggest that the NiCo molybdate system could serve as an alternative to vanadium-based catalysts for activating light paraffins. Moreover, it is seen as promising for the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor, in conjunction with other olefin-converting catalysts. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as catalyst activity, selectivity, and conversion rates. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by optimizing the reaction environment for specific alkane activation.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include understanding the reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by affecting the rate of reaction, energy consumption, and product purity. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the active sites of the catalyst are isolated from other reactive species, thus enhancing the specificity of the reaction towards the desired product.

2. The use of metal molybdates, particularly those based on nickel and cobalt, shows promise in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their ability to activate propane at relatively low temperatures. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on the choice of metal and the surface area of the catalyst. Binary and ternary molybdate compositions can offer optimized activity and selectivity, depending on the specific conditions and desired product.

3. The addition of redox elements like vanadium, iron, cerium, and chromium to nickel-cobalt molybdate systems can enhance their activity, with chromium showing particular promise due to its ability to retain high selectivity at higher conversion rates. This suggests that chromium could enable a reduction in the operating temperature of the process, potentially leading to energy savings and improved efficiency.

4. The nickel-cobalt molybdate system represents an alternative to vanadium-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins. This system could be integrated into a two-component catalyst system for the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor. The second component of such a system would likely consist of a well-known olefin-converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdate, enabling a comprehensive approach to the conversion of propane into valuable organic compounds.
