[1] "More recently (2), research aims have shifted from functionalizing olefins to functionalizing the more abundant and less expensive paraffinic feedstocks, in an effort to meet future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs."
[2] "In the area of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, several systems have emerged in recent years holding some promise for further study and development, particularly when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane."
[3] "While Hardman (10) studied primarily CoMoO4 based catalysts for the oxydehydration of propane to propylene, and Mazzochia et al. (11) primarily NiMoO4, we undertook a broader investigation of propane oxydehydrogenation, studying single and binary molybdates of the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn; some ternary molybdates of the for- mulaNi0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4,whereX = P,Bi,Fe,Cr,V,and Ce; and systems of the formula Ni0.5Co0.5Y0.002MoO4, where Y = K or Cs."
[4] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins. Futuristically, it holds promise as the paraffin activating component of a two component catalyst system for the direct conversion, in a single reactor, of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile, with the second component being composed of one of the well known olefin converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdates."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it is evident that the field has shifted focus from olefin functionalization to paraffin activation due to the abundance and cost-effectiveness of paraffins. This shift aims to cater to future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs. Researchers have explored multiple systems for paraffin oxydehydrogenation, particularly targeting propane, i-butane, and n-butane. A broad investigation of molybdate catalysts, including single and binary molybdates of the formula AMoO4 (where A is Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn), ternary molybdates, and systems with a mix of metals like Ni and Co, has been conducted. These studies suggest that the NiCo molybdate system could serve as an alternative to vanadium-based catalysts for activating light paraffins. Moreover, it is seen as promising for the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor, in conjunction with other olefin-converting catalysts. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as catalyst activity, selectivity, and conversion rates. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by optimizing the reaction environment for specific alkane activation.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，研究领域已从烯烃功能化转向利用更为丰富且成本较低的烷烃原料，以满足未来化工、纤维和聚合物的需求。研究人员探索了多个烷烃氧化脱氢系统，特别是针对丙烷、异丁烷和正丁烷。对钼酸盐催化剂，包括单组分和双组分钼酸盐（如AMoO4，其中A为Ni、Co、Mg、Mn和/或Zn）、三元钼酸盐以及镍钴组合等，进行了广泛研究。研究表明，镍钴钼酸盐系统可能成为轻质烷烃活化的一种替代范式，与基于钒的催化剂相比。此外，该系统在单个反应器中直接将丙烷转化为丙烯酸或丙烯腈具有前景，同时与另一种已知的多组分混合金属钼酸盐协同工作，用于烯烃转化。过程效率受催化剂活性、选择性和转化率等因素影响。通过优化反应环境，实现特定烷烃活化，位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面发挥着关键作用。
