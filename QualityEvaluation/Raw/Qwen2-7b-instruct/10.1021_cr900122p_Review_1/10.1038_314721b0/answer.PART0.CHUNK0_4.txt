[1] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
[2] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The synthesis of ethylene and ethane through the partial oxidation of methane over lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) has been successful. The catalyst demonstrates high activity in extracting hydrogen from methane to form ·CH3 radicals. These radicals couple to produce C2 compounds, specifically ethylene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6).

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In many of the existing processes, nitrogen dioxide (N2O) is the required oxidant instead of oxygen (O2). Our laboratory has reported success in converting methane (CH4) to C2 compounds with high yields under conventional catalytic conditions.
