[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
[2] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
[3] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."
[4] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

The synthesis of ethylene and ethane through the partial oxidation of methane over lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) has been successfully achieved. This method leverages the high activity of Li/MgO for hydrogen abstraction from methane, forming ·CH3 radicals. The coupling of these radicals results in the production of C2 compounds, specifically ethylene and ethane, with high yields under conventional catalytic conditions.

通过锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li/MgO）对甲烷的部分氧化，成功合成了乙烯和乙烷。这种方法利用了Li/MgO在氧气存在的高活性，从甲烷中提取氢，形成·CH3自由基。这些自由基的耦合产生了C2化合物，特别是乙烯和乙烷，并在常规催化条件下获得了高产率。
