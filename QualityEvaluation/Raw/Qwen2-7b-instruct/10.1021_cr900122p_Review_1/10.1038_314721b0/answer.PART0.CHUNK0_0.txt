[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
[2] "Moreover, in several of these processes the required oxidant is N2O rather than O2."
[3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
[4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."

1. The synthesis of ethylene and ethane through partial oxidation of methane over lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) has been shown to be an efficient process due to the high activity of the catalyst in abstracting hydrogen from methane to form ·CH3 radicals. This process results in the production of C2 compounds, specifically C2H6 and C2H4, which are formed by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals.

2. The challenge in achieving high selectivity and conversion in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes lies in the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges include the difficulty in activating C-H bonds, forming M-alkyl intermediates, and efficiently removing hydrogen atoms through 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by affecting the rate and direction of chemical reactions.

3. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues in ODH processes. By isolating active sites on the catalyst surface, the risk of unwanted side reactions is reduced, thereby improving the selectivity towards desired products. This is achieved through the design of catalysts with well-defined active sites that promote the specific reaction pathways leading to the formation of target products.

1. 使用锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li/MgO）进行甲烷的部分氧化，以合成更有用的化学物质如乙醇、乙烯和苯，已经进行了广泛的研究，尽管这些产品的产率较低。由于该催化剂在从甲烷中提取氢原子形成·CH3自由基时表现出高活性，这一过程能够高效地产生C2化合物，即C2H6和C2H4。这两个化合物通过催化剂上形成的两个气体·CH3自由基之间的耦合而产生。

2. 在烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中实现高选择性和转化的挑战在于各种催化剂（包括体金属氧化物和支持系统）之间的复杂相互作用。挑战包括C-H键的活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及有效移除氢原子通过2H抽取。这些因素共同影响工艺效率，因为它们影响化学反应的速度和方向。

3. 场点隔离在解决ODH过程的选择性问题中起着关键作用。通过设计具有明确活性位点的催化剂，可以减少非期望副反应的风险，从而提高目标产物的选择性。这通过设计具有特定反应路径促进目标产物形成的催化剂表面活性位点来实现。
