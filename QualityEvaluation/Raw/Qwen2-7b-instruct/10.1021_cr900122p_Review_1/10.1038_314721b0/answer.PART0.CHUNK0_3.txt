[1] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
[2] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."
[3] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

The synthesis of ethylene and ethane from methane through partial oxidation involves the use of lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as a catalyst in the presence of oxygen. The process demonstrates high activity in abstracting hydrogen from methane to form methyl radicals. These radicals then couple to produce ethylene and ethane. This method achieves high yields of C2 compounds under conventional catalytic conditions.

在我们的实验室中，最近的工作表明，在氧气的存在下，锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li/MgO）具有高活性，可以从甲烷中提取氢形成·CH3自由基。这表明由催化剂上形成的两个气态·CH3自由基之间的耦合可以产生乙烷和乙烯。这种方法在常规催化条件下能够高效地将甲烷转化为C2化合物。
