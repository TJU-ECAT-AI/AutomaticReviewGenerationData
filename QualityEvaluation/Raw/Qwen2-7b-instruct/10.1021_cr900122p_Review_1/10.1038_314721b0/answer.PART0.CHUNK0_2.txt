[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
[2] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
[3] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document highlights the use of lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as an effective catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane. It suggests that under conventional catalytic conditions, this catalyst can efficiently convert methane into higher-value C2 compounds such as ethylene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6). The catalyst's ability to abstract hydrogen from methane to form ·CH3 radicals plays a crucial role in this process. The document also mentions the potential for coupling between these radicals to produce the desired C2 compounds. However, the document does not explicitly discuss the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion or propose detailed reaction mechanisms.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），文献强调了锂掺杂的镁氧化物（Li/MgO）作为甲烷部分氧化的有效催化剂。它表明，在常规催化条件下，该催化剂可以高效地将甲烷转化为更高的价值C2化合物，如乙烯（C2H4）和乙烷（C2H6）。催化剂从甲烷中提取氢形成·CH3自由基的能力在这一过程中起着关键作用。文献还提到了这些自由基之间的耦合可能产生所需C2化合物的可能性。然而，文献没有明确讨论实现高选择性和转化率的挑战，也没有提出详细的反应机制。
