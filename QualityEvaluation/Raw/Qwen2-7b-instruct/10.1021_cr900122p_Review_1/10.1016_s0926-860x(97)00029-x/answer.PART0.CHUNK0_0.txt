[1] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
[2] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
[3] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
[4] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
[5] "However, if we only consider the coordination of vS+-species and/or the distance between two active sites as responsible of the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, it is very difficult to explain the different catalytic behavior of both SIO2- and A1203-supported vanadia catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane."
[6] "In this way, while crystalline V2Os-like structures are obtained at relatively low vanadium coverages (10% of the theoretical monolayer) on an acid metal oxide as SiO2 [61], metal vanadates are formed, at relatively high vanadium content and surface coverages of the support, on basic metal oxide supports [57]."
[7] "While isolated tetrahedral VS+-species of the (SiO)3V=O type has been proposed as selective sites in VOJSiO2 catalysts [14,15], while both isolated and polymeric tetrahedral V 5+ species are mainly present on selective VOJA1203 catalysts [19,96]."
[8] "From these results it was concluded that the use of basic metal oxides induced the formation of tetrahedral V 5+ species which could be considered as the selective sites in the ODH of alkanes."
[9] "It can be expected that a stronger olefin adsorption on acid sites during the ODH of n-butane will favor the isomerization (at low alkane conversions) and the deep oxidation (at high alkane conversions)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves multiple factors influencing process efficiency and selectivity. The nature of the catalyst, including whether it is a bulk metal oxide or supported system, significantly impacts the reaction outcome. The mechanical strength, thermal stability, and surface area of supported metal oxides offer advantages over bulk oxides. The catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxides, however, is influenced by the properties of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Enhanced selectivity is achieved by mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides, particularly on basic supports, which promotes the formation of desired olefins. The coordination and environment of vanadium species modify their redox properties, affecting catalytic behavior. Considering only the coordination and distance between active sites is insufficient to explain the differing behaviors of catalysts supported on different metal oxides, especially for n-butane and ethane. The formation of vanadium species on the surface varies with the acidity of the support, with V2O5-like structures appearing on more acidic supports at lower vanadium coverages and metal vanadates on more basic supports at higher coverages. The selectivity in ODH reactions can be attributed to tetrahedral V 5+ species, which are prevalent on basic supports. The acid-base character of the catalyst surface influences the selectivity, as it affects the rate of olefin adsorption, desorption, and isomerization. Stronger olefin adsorption on acid sites leads to isomerization at low conversions and deep oxidation at high conversions.

氧化脱氢反应（ODH）涉及多个因素影响过程效率和选择性。催化剂的性质，包括是否为块状金属氧化物或支持系统，显著影响反应结果。支持金属氧化物的机械强度、热稳定性和表面积优于块状氧化物的优势。支持的钒氧化物的催化行为受到支持金属氧化物的特性和钒加载的影响。通过混合或在其他金属氧化物上支持钒氧化物，特别是基本支持物，可以实现对所需烯烃的增强选择性。表面范德华物种的协调和环境修改了它们的还原氧化性，影响催化行为。仅考虑配位和活性位点之间的距离不足以解释不同金属氧化物支持的催化剂的不同行为，尤其是对于丁烷和乙烷。在表面上形成的钒物种随酸度的变化而变化，在更酸性的支持上，在较低的钒覆盖下形成V2O5类似结构，在更基本的支持上，在更高的覆盖下形成金属钒化物。选择性ODH反应可以归因于基本支持物上的四面体V 5+物种。催化剂表面的酸碱性影响选择性，因为它影响烯烃的吸附、脱附和异构化速率。在低转化率时，强烯烃吸附导致异构化，在高转化率时，深度氧化。
