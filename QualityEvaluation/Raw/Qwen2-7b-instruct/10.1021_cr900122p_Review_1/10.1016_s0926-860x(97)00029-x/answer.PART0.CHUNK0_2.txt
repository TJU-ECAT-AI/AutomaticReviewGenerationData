1. This paper discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of short chain alkanes using supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Supported vanadium oxides exhibit selectivity in various catalytic reactions, such as methanol oxidation, methane oxidation, olefin oxidation, aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation, and NOx selective catalytic reduction. The use of supported metal oxides offers benefits in terms of mechanical strength, thermal stability, and surface area. The dispersion and structure of vanadium oxide are influenced by the acid-base characteristics of the support material. 

2. At low vanadium coverages (10% of the theoretical monolayer), crystalline V2Os-like structures are formed on acidic supports like SiO2, whereas metal vanadates are formed on basic supports at higher vanadium contents. The catalytic behavior of supported catalysts is influenced by the vanadium loading, which also depends on the alkane being fed.

3. Studies have focused on monolayer systems to optimize the dispersion of active sites and better understand the impact of the support on catalyst behavior. The catalytic performance of supported catalysts is affected by the vanadium loading, which also varies with the alkane fed.

4. Both isolated tetrahedral V5+ species and dymeric/polymeric tetrahedral V5+ species are identified as active and selective sites in the ODH of alkanes. The reaction kinetics and mechanism, however, have received limited attention in the literature.

1. 本文探讨了在支持的钒氧化物催化剂上进行短链烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）。支持的钒氧化物在甲醇氧化、甲烷氧化、烯烃氧化、芳香族碳氢化合物氧化和NOx选择性催化还原等反应中显示出选择性。使用支持金属氧化物提供了机械强度、热稳定性和表面积的优势。范德华氧化物的分散和结构受到支持材料酸碱特性的影响。

2. 在较低的钒覆盖率（理论单分子层的10%）下，酸性支持如SiO2上形成结晶的V2Os-like结构，而在基本支持材料上，在较高的钒含量和表面覆盖率时形成金属钒酸盐。支持催化剂的催化性能受钒负载的影响，这种影响也取决于所使用的烷烃。

3. 已经关注单分子层系统来优化活性位点的分散并更好地理解支撑材料的影响。支持催化剂的催化性能受钒负载的影响，这种影响也取决于所使用的烷烃。

4. 隔离的四面体V5+物种和多聚四面体V5+物种都被认为是烷烃的ODH中的活性和选择性位点。然而，关于反应动力学和机制的研究在文献中受到了限制。
