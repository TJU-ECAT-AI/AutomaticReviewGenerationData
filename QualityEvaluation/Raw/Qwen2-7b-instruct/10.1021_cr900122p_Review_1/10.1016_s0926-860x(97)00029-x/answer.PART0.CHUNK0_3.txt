The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts involves the influence of the acid-base character of the metal oxide support on the dispersion of vanadium species. Tetrahedral VS+ species are identified as active and selective sites for the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number, aggregation state, and presence of acid/base sites on the catalyst surface play crucial roles in determining the catalytic behavior and selectivity. The authors conclude that considering these factors is essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions.

[1] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."
[2] "In this paper, we can conclude that supported vanadium oxide catalysts appear to be selective materials in the ODH reactions."
[3] "Several factors can contribute to their catalytic behavior, i.e. coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of vanadium species), reducibility of active sites and acid-base character of catalysts and metal oxide support."
[4] "The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support."
[5] "In addition, and concluding from the most selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins."

The reducibility, structure, and acid-base character of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the catalytic properties in the ODH of C3-C4 alkanes, significantly depend on the metal oxide used and the vanadium loading. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are found to be selective materials in ODH reactions. The catalyst's behavior is influenced by factors such as the coordination number, dispersion of active sites, reducibility of active sites, and the acid-base character of the catalyst and metal oxide support. For optimal performance, vanadium must be highly dispersed on the metal oxide support. Additionally, stabilizing vanadium in a low coordination number helps to limit the consecutive reactions of formed olefins.

在本论文中，我们可以得出结论，支持的钒氧化物催化剂在ODH反应中似乎是选择性的材料。还原性、结构和催化剂及其金属氧化物支持的酸碱性特征，以及C3-C4烷烃的ODH催化性能，很大程度上取决于所使用的金属氧化物和支持的钒负载量。支持的钒氧化物催化剂在ODH反应中显示出选择性。催化剂的行为受到配位数、活性位点间距离（钒物种的分散）、活性位点的还原性和催化剂及金属氧化物支持的酸碱性等多因素的影响。为了达到最佳性能，钒必须高度分散在金属氧化物支持上。此外，通过稳定钒在较低的配位数，可以限制形成烯烃的连续反应。
