[1] "This paper summarizes the main data appeared in the last years on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions are also an attractive alternative to classical dehydrogenations."
[3] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
[4] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
[5] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
[6] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
[7] "The characteristics of catalysts supported on A1203 and TiO2 are in agreement with their acid character."
[8] "In order to explain the importance of the V-loading and thus of the VOx species on the selectivity to ODH reactions, Fig. 3 shows the variation of the selectivity to C4-olefins with the vanadium loading during the ODH of n-butane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[9] "While isolated tetrahedral VS+-species of the (SiO)3V=O type has been proposed as selective sites in VOJSiO2 catalysts [14,15], while both isolated and polymeric tetrahedral V 5+ species are mainly present on selective VOJA1203 catalysts [19,96]."
[10] "However, if we only consider the coordination of vS+-species and/or the distance between two active sites as responsible of the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, it is very difficult to explain the different catalytic behavior of both SIO2- and A1203-supported vanadia catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the key factors influencing the process efficiency and selectivity include the nature of the metal oxide support, the dispersion and coordination state of the vanadium species, and the acid-base character of the catalysts. High mechanical strength, thermal stability, and surface area provided by supported metal oxides offer advantages in catalyst design. The selectivity of bulk V205 can be enhanced by mixing or supporting it on other metal oxides, leading to improved olefin formation rates. The catalytic behavior is significantly affected by the type of metal oxide support and vanadium loading, with tetrahedral V5+ species being identified as active sites in ODH reactions. Acid-base character of the catalysts and metal oxide support plays a crucial role in determining selectivity to olefins, depending on the alkane fed. Site isolation and the presence of V=O double bonds in vanadium species contribute to selective O-insertion reactions, highlighting the importance of site dispersion and coordination state in addressing selectivity issues.
