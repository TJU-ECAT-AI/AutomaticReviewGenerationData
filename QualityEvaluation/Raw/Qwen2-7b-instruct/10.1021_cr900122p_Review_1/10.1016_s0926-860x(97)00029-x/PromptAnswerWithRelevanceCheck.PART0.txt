[1] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
[2] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
[3] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
[4] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
[5] "However, if we only consider the coordination of vS+-species and/or the distance between two active sites as responsible of the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, it is very difficult to explain the different catalytic behavior of both SIO2- and A1203-supported vanadia catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane."
[6] "In this way, while crystalline V2Os-like structures are obtained at relatively low vanadium coverages (10% of the theoretical monolayer) on an acid metal oxide as SiO2 [61], metal vanadates are formed, at relatively high vanadium content and surface coverages of the support, on basic metal oxide supports [57]."
[7] "While isolated tetrahedral VS+-species of the (SiO)3V=O type has been proposed as selective sites in VOJSiO2 catalysts [14,15], while both isolated and polymeric tetrahedral V 5+ species are mainly present on selective VOJA1203 catalysts [19,96]."
[8] "From these results it was concluded that the use of basic metal oxides induced the formation of tetrahedral V 5+ species which could be considered as the selective sites in the ODH of alkanes."
[9] "It can be expected that a stronger olefin adsorption on acid sites during the ODH of n-butane will favor the isomerization (at low alkane conversions) and the deep oxidation (at high alkane conversions)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves multiple factors influencing process efficiency and selectivity. The nature of the catalyst, including whether it is a bulk metal oxide or supported system, significantly impacts the reaction outcome. The mechanical strength, thermal stability, and surface area of supported metal oxides offer advantages over bulk oxides. The catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxides, however, is influenced by the properties of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Enhanced selectivity is achieved by mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides, particularly on basic supports, which promotes the formation of desired olefins. The coordination and environment of vanadium species modify their redox properties, affecting catalytic behavior. Considering only the coordination and distance between active sites is insufficient to explain the differing behaviors of catalysts supported on different metal oxides, especially for n-butane and ethane. The formation of vanadium species on the surface varies with the acidity of the support, with V2O5-like structures appearing on more acidic supports at lower vanadium coverages and metal vanadates on more basic supports at higher coverages. The selectivity in ODH reactions can be attributed to tetrahedral V 5+ species, which are prevalent on basic supports. The acid-base character of the catalyst surface influences the selectivity, as it affects the rate of olefin adsorption, desorption, and isomerization. Stronger olefin adsorption on acid sites leads to isomerization at low conversions and deep oxidation at high conversions.

氧化脱氢反应（ODH）涉及多个因素影响过程效率和选择性。催化剂的性质，包括是否为块状金属氧化物或支持系统，显著影响反应结果。支持金属氧化物的机械强度、热稳定性和表面积优于块状氧化物的优势。支持的钒氧化物的催化行为受到支持金属氧化物的特性和钒加载的影响。通过混合或在其他金属氧化物上支持钒氧化物，特别是基本支持物，可以实现对所需烯烃的增强选择性。表面范德华物种的协调和环境修改了它们的还原氧化性，影响催化行为。仅考虑配位和活性位点之间的距离不足以解释不同金属氧化物支持的催化剂的不同行为，尤其是对于丁烷和乙烷。在表面上形成的钒物种随酸度的变化而变化，在更酸性的支持上，在较低的钒覆盖下形成V2O5类似结构，在更基本的支持上，在更高的覆盖下形成金属钒化物。选择性ODH反应可以归因于基本支持物上的四面体V 5+物种。催化剂表面的酸碱性影响选择性，因为它影响烯烃的吸附、脱附和异构化速率。在低转化率时，强烯烃吸附导致异构化，在高转化率时，深度氧化。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves examining the interaction between catalysts, primarily focusing on the differences between bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complexity of the reactions, including the need for precise control over the dispersion of vanadium species, the reducibility of active sites, and the acid-base character of the catalyst and metal oxide support. The role of site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues, aiming to prevent consecutive reactions that could lead to the formation of undesired products.

The dispersion of vanadium on the metal oxide support significantly impacts the catalytic properties, with tetrahedral VS+-species being identified as active and selective sites for the ODH of alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of vanadium species further influence the reaction pathways, with octahedral species facilitating the incorporation of oxygen atoms into the olefinic intermediate, potentially leading to selective or non-selective oxidation products. Acid-base sites, strongly dependent on the nature of the metal oxide support, play a critical role in determining the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products, depending on the alkane fed. 

The rate of olefin formation and desorption is influenced by the acid-base character of the catalysts, considered as key selectivity-determining steps. High selectivity during the ODH of n-butane on catalysts with a basic character contrasts with lower selectivity observed during the ODH of ethane on catalysts with an acid character. The presence of V=O double bonds on catalysts with high vanadium content is responsible for selective O-insertion reactions, enhancing the formation of desired oxydehydrogenation products.

In summary, the design of efficient catalytic systems for the ODH reactions requires careful consideration of the dispersion of vanadium species, the stabilization of vanadium in a low coordination number to limit consecutive reactions, and the presence of V=O double bonds for selective O-insertion. The environment of vanadium species, including the strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions, the appearance of acid and/or basic sites, and the alkane fed, collectively influence process efficiency and selectivity.

分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及催化剂之间的相互作用，主要关注的是纯金属氧化物和支撑系统之间的差异。实现高选择性和转化的挑战来自于反应的复杂性，包括精确控制钒物种的分散、活性位点的可还原性和催化剂和支持金属氧化物的酸碱性质。隔离位点在解决选择性问题中至关重要，旨在防止可能导致非期望产物形成的连续反应。

金属氧化物支持上钒的分散显著影响催化性能，四面体VS+-物种被识别为C2至C4烷烃ODH的活性和选择性位点。钒物种的配位数和聚集状态进一步影响反应途径，八面体物种促进氧原子插入烯烃中间体，可能形成选择性或非选择性氧化产物。酸碱位点，强烈依赖于金属氧化物支持的性质，在决定氧脱氢化产物的选择性方面起着关键作用，这取决于所使用的烷烃。

烯烃形成和脱附的速度受到催化剂酸碱性质的影响，被认为是决定选择性的关键步骤。n-丁烷的高选择性ODH发生在具有基本特性的催化剂上，而n-乙烷的低选择性发生在具有酸性特性的催化剂上。在高钒含量的催化剂上存在的V=O双键对选择性O插入反应负责，增强预期的氧脱氢化产物的形成。

总之，设计高效的催化系统用于ODH反应需要仔细考虑钒物种的分散、将钒稳定在低配位数以限制连续反应以及存在V=O双键以进行选择性O插入。钒物种的环境，包括桥接V-O支持氧离子的强度和可还原性、出现酸性和/或碱性位点以及所使用的烷烃，共同影响过程效率和选择性。

Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are found to be selective materials in ODH reactions. The catalyst's behavior is influenced by factors such as the coordination number, dispersion of active sites, reducibility of active sites, and the acid-base character of the catalyst and metal oxide support.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the key factors influencing the process efficiency and selectivity include the nature of the metal oxide support, the dispersion and coordination state of the vanadium species, and the acid-base character of the catalysts. High mechanical strength, thermal stability, and surface area provided by supported metal oxides offer advantages in catalyst design. The selectivity of bulk V205 can be enhanced by mixing or supporting it on other metal oxides, leading to improved olefin formation rates. The catalytic behavior is significantly affected by the type of metal oxide support and vanadium loading, with tetrahedral V5+ species being identified as active sites in ODH reactions. Acid-base character of the catalysts and metal oxide support plays a crucial role in determining selectivity to olefins, depending on the alkane fed.
