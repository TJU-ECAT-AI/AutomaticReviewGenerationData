Formaldehyde production has been related to the density and activity of three types of active sites present on the W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of silica surface, terminal W=O sites and WOW functionalities. These results agree with those previously reported by the authors for W/HZSM-5 catalysts.

The effect of the tungsten oxide phase as a promoter of the catalytic activity of the silica surface is quite different in the two catalyst series. In the LSiW series, the tungsten overlayer enhances for any W loading both the SSA and SPHCOH of the silica. On the other hand, in the HSiW catalysts with tungsten contents up to 7.1 wt%, the SSA of the bare silica is improved whereas higher W loading induces a negative effect.

The tungsten oxide layer acts as a promoter of the silica surface's catalytic activity differently in the two catalyst series. In the LSiW series, the tungsten overlay boosts both the SSA and SPHCOH of the silica for any tungsten loading. Conversely, in the HSiW catalysts containing tungsten up to 7.1 wt%, the SSA of the bare silica improves, but higher tungsten loading leads to a negative effect.

钨氧化层作为促进二氧化硅表面催化活性的作用，在两个催化剂系列中有所不同。在LSiW系列中，无论钨负载如何，钨覆盖层都能增强二氧化硅的SSA和SPHCOH。相反，在含有钨至7.1 wt%的HSiW催化剂中，裸露的二氧化硅的SSA得到改善，而更高的钨负载则产生负面影响。

The presence of the LSiW catalysts with W loading higher than 4.0 wt% of W=O terminal sites in WO3 crystallites would be responsible for the high HCOH selectivity exhibited by these catalysts (Table 2).
For the HSiW catalysts, on account of the high surface area of the support, the SPHCOH will be a function of both density and activity of three types of surface sites, namely: active sites of silica surface; WOW bridging functionalities, that enable total oxidation of either CH4 or CO [3,12,13,26]; and W=O terminal sites.

The presence of LSiW catalysts with tungsten loading greater than 4.0 wt% of W=O terminal sites in WO3 crystals is responsible for the high HCOH selectivity shown by these catalysts (Table 2). For the HSiW catalysts, given the high surface area of the support, the SPHCOH depends on the density and activity of three types of surface sites: active sites of the silica surface, bridging WOW functionalities enabling complete oxidation of either CH4 or CO [3,12,13,26], and W=O terminal sites.

LSiW催化剂中钨加载大于4.0 wt%的W=O末端基团存在于WO3晶体中，这是这些催化剂表现出高HCOH选择性的原因（表2）。对于HSiW催化剂，由于支撑体的高表面面积，SPHCOH取决于三种表面位点的密度和活性：硅酸盐表面的活性位点，能够完全氧化CH4或CO的WOW桥接功能[3,12,13,26]；以及W=O末端基团。

A close relationship between the dispersion of the tungsten species and the catalyst reducibility is observed. Thus, highly reducible tungsten oxide phase of the low surface catalysts enhances the activity of the bare silica whereas hardly reducible tungsten species of the high surface catalysts exert a negative effect on the silica activity.

A direct correlation is observed between the dispersion of tungsten species and catalyst reducibility. Consequently, the highly reducible tungsten oxide phase in low surface area catalysts boosts the activity of the bare silica, whereas the hardly reducible tungsten species in high surface area catalysts negatively impact the silica's activity.
