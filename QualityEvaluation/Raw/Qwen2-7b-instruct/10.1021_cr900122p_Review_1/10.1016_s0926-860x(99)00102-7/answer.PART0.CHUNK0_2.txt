[1] "The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/SiO2 catalysts has been widely studied in the last years."
[2] "Despite the literature reported, there is practically no paper in which the simultaneous influence of both silica surface area and metal oxide loading on the catalytic pattern is specifically studied."
[3] "Both bare silica samples lead to similar methane conversion values, although the high surface area silica exhibits a higher selectivity to formaldehyde."
[4] "The SSA values achieved with W/HZSM-5 catalysts are between those of the HSiW and LSiW catalyst series."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from factors such as the efficiency of C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by affecting the rates of desired reactions versus unwanted side reactions. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing interactions between different reaction pathways. For instance, the presence of a well-dispersed tungsten oxide overlayer on high surface area catalysts can enhance the activity of the bare silica, whereas a highly reducible tungsten oxide phase on low surface area catalysts can enhance the activity of the bare silica. Formaldehyde production is related to the density and activity of three types of active sites present in W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of silica surface, terminal W=O sites, and WOW bridging functionalities. These findings align with those reported for W/HZSM-5 catalysts, highlighting the importance of catalyst design in optimizing ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统。实现高选择性和转化的挑战来自于诸如C-H键激活的效率、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H的抽象等因素。这些因素共同影响过程效率，通过影响期望反应速率与副反应速率之间的关系来影响。站点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过最小化不同反应途径之间的相互作用。例如，在高表面面积催化剂上存在的分散良好的钨氧化物覆盖层可以增强裸硅酸盐的活性，而在低表面面积催化剂上存在高度可还原的钨氧化物相则可以增强裸硅酸盐的活性。甲醛生成与W/SiO2催化剂中存在的三种类型的活性位点密度和活性有关：硅酸盐表面活性位点、末端W=O位点以及使CH4或CO完全氧化的WOW桥接功能。这些发现与W/HZSM-5催化剂的一致性强调了催化剂设计在优化ODH过程中的重要性。
