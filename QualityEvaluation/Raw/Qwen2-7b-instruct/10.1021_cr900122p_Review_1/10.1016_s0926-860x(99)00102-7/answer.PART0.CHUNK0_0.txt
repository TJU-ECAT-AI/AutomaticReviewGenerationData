[1] "Two samples of silica with different surface area have been used in the preparation of silica-supported tungsten oxide catalysts with W loading ranging from 0.8 to 15.8 wt%."
[2] "It has been shown that both surface area and tungsten loading affect the nature and dispersion of the tungsten oxide species and, therefore, the catalytic behavior of the samples."
[3] "Formaldehyde production has been related to the density and activity of three types of active sites present on the W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of silica surface, terminal W=O sites and WOW functionalities."
[4] "A close relationship between the dispersion of the tungsten species and the catalyst reducibility is observed. Thus, highly reducible tungsten oxide phase of the low surface catalysts enhances the activity of the bare silica whereas hardly reducible tungsten species of the high surface catalysts exert a negative effect on the silica activity."
[5] "Formaldehyde production has been related to the density and activity of three types of active sites present in W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of silica surface, terminal W=O sites, both leading to HCOH formation, and WOW bridging functionalities that enable total oxidation of either CH4 or CO."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The efficiency of ODH is influenced by several factors, including the selectivity and conversion rates, which can be challenging to achieve simultaneously. Catalysts with high surface area and appropriate tungsten loading can lead to the formation of tungsten oxide species that are crucial for the reaction mechanism. These species can activate C-H bonds, create M-alkyl intermediates, and facilitate 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the active sites are isolated from non-reactive regions of the catalyst. This isolation helps to direct the reaction pathways towards the desired product, thereby improving the overall process efficiency.

The nature of the tungsten oxide species, their dispersion, and reducibility are key factors affecting the catalytic behavior of the samples. Highly reducible tungsten oxide phases enhance the activity of the bare silica, while hardly reducible tungsten species in high surface catalysts have a negative impact on the silica activity. The relationship between the dispersion of tungsten species and catalyst reducibility is critical in determining the effectiveness of the catalyst in promoting the ODH process.

The density and activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, including those of the silica surface, terminal W=O sites, and WOW functionalities, contribute significantly to the selectivity and conversion in the ODH process. Terminal W=O sites are particularly important in the production of formaldehyde, while WOW functionalities enable the total oxidation of either methane or carbon monoxide. Understanding these interactions allows for the optimization of catalyst design and operating conditions to achieve high selectivity and conversion in the ODH process.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及多种催化剂，包括体金属氧化物和支撑系统之间的复杂交互作用。在ODH过程中，选择性和转化率的平衡是实现高效率的关键挑战。具有大表面积和适当钨负载的催化剂可以促进反应机制中所需钨氧化物种的形成。这些物种可以活化C-H键、产生M-烷基中间体，并促进2H摘除。位点隔离对于解决选择性问题至关重要，它确保活性位点与催化剂上的非反应区域分离，从而引导反应路径，提高整体过程效率。

钨氧化物种的性质、分散性和还原性是决定样品催化行为的关键因素。高度可还原的钨氧化物相可以增强裸露硅酸盐的活性，而高表面积催化剂中的几乎不可还原的钨物种对硅酸盐活性有负面影响。钨物种分散性和催化剂还原性之间的关系对促进ODH过程的催化剂的有效性至关重要。

催化剂表面密度和活性位点的数量和活性，包括硅酸盐表面、末端W=O位点和WOW功能性的活性位点，对选择性和转化率有很大影响。末端W=O位点特别重要，因为它们有助于甲醛的生成，而WOW功能允许完全氧化甲烷或一氧化碳。理解这些相互作用允许优化催化剂设计和操作条件，以实现ODH过程中的高选择性和转化率。
