Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/SiO2 catalysts. A. de Lucas, J.L. Valverde*, P. Canizares, L. Rodriguez. Applied Catalysis A: General 184 (1999) 143-152.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves the conversion of hydrocarbons to alkenes through breaking of C-H bonds. The efficiency of this process depends on the selectivity and conversion achieved, which are influenced by the choice of catalyst, its composition, and the reaction conditions.

Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, are used in ODH processes. The choice of catalyst significantly affects the selectivity and conversion rates. Supported systems often exhibit better performance due to enhanced dispersion of the active species and improved accessibility of the substrate. 

Achieving high selectivity in ODH presents a challenge, as it requires the selective activation and abstraction of C-H bonds without unwanted side reactions. The role of site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues. Site isolation refers to the confinement of reactive sites to prevent non-selective pathways. This is particularly important in ODH, where the risk of forming unwanted products, such as alcohols or other non-alkene compounds, is high.

The reaction mechanisms typically involve C-H bond activation, followed by the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, where M represents the metal component of the catalyst. This leads to the abstraction of a hydrogen atom (2H-abstraction), resulting in the formation of alkenes. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, the strength of the metal-carbon bond, and the kinetic stability of the intermediates.

In summary, the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing non-selective pathways and enhancing the specificity of the reaction.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及通过断裂C-H键将烃类转化为烯烃。此过程的效率依赖于实现高选择性和转化率，这受到催化剂选择、其组成和反应条件的影响。各种催化剂，包括单体金属氧化物和支持系统，在ODH过程中被使用。催化剂的选择显著影响选择性和转化率，支持系统的性能通常更优，由于活性物种的分散增强和底物可及性的改善。实现高选择性是一个挑战，需要选择性激活和抽离C-H键而不发生不希望的副反应。位点隔离，即限制活性位点以防止非选择性路径，对于解决选择性问题至关重要。在ODH中，形成非-烯烃化合物等不期望产物的风险较高，这是特别重要的。反应机制通常涉及C-H键的活化，随后是M-烷基中间体的形成，其中M代表催化剂中的金属成分。这导致了一个氢原子（2H抽离）的抽象，从而形成了烯烃。此过程的效率受催化剂的性质、金属-碳键的强度以及中间体的热动力学稳定性的影响。
