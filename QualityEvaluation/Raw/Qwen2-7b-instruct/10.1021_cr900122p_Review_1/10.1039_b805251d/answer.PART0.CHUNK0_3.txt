The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a process involving the conversion of alkanes into alkenes and COx (CO and CO2) through primary and secondary reactions. Catalysts used in this process can range from bulk metal oxides to supported systems, each influencing the efficiency of the reaction differently. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the complexity of the reaction pathways, including C-H bond activation, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. 

In the case of MoOx and VOx, the catalytic process proceeds via reduction-oxidation cycles, which involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms following the Mars and van Krevelen pathways. The efficiency of these reactions is influenced by the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during the activation of C-H bonds. This ability is reflected in the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains, which decrease in energy order Nb > W > Mo > V as the size of the oxide domains and the reducibility of the support increase.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the catalytic sites are distinct and not overly crowded. This is important because it helps prevent side reactions and ensures that the primary reaction pathway is followed efficiently. The extent of reduction during catalysis also impacts selectivity, as it is influenced by the reductant/oxidant ratio and the kinetic relevance of the CH bond activation steps.

Metal identity has a significant impact on both the LMCT absorption edge energy and the propane ODH turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the electronic properties of the catalyst, such as the energy level of the LUMO, are critical determinants of the reaction efficiency. By controlling these properties through the choice of metal and support, it is possible to tailor the catalyst for optimal performance in the ODH process.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及主反应和副反应，其速率可以通过停留时间对生成烯烃和COx（CO和CO2）的形成速率的影响来测量。催化剂可以是块状金属氧化物或支持系统，每种系统都会以不同的方式影响反应效率。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通常来自于复杂反应途径的影响，包括C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-摘除。

钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（VOx）的催化过程通过还原-氧化循环进行，这些循环涉及通过Mars和van Krevelen提出的路径去除和替换晶格氧原子。这些反应的效率受到氧化物域在C-H键活化期间接受电子的能力的影响。这种能力体现在MOx域最低未占据状态的能量水平上，这些能量水平遵循Nb > W > Mo > V的顺序递减，随着氧化物域的大小和支持材料的可还原性增加。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，确保催化位点不拥挤，有助于防止副反应并确保主要反应途径的有效执行。催化过程中的减少程度也影响选择性，因为它受还原剂/氧化剂比例和C-H键活化步骤的动态相关性的影响。

金属身份对两者都有重大影响：LMCT吸收边缘能量和丙烷ODH转速。这种相关性表明，催化剂的电子性质，如LUMO的能量水平，是决定反应效率的关键因素。通过控制这些性质，即选择金属和支持，有可能为ODH过程定制催化剂以获得最佳性能。
