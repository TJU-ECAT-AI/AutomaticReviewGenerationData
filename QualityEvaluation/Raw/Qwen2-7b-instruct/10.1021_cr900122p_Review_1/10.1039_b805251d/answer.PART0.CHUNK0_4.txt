[1] "Alkane and alkanol oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on supported MOx domains involve kinetically relevant CH bond breaking steps. These steps lead to the formal reduction of metal centers in oxide domains and to marked effects of domain size, through their concomitant effects on electronic properties and reduction dynamics."
[2] "Supported MOx catalysts with different metal atoms (V, Mo, W, Nb), surface densities, and supports show a common increase in oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates with decreasing energies for oxygen-to-metal charge transitions."
[3] "These universal trends reflect a concurrent decrease in the activation barriers for kinetically relevant CH bond activation steps as the energy level of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains decreases."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves key steps such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of this process is influenced by various factors including the selectivity and conversion rates, the role of different catalysts (bulk metal oxides and supported systems), and the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Catalysts with different metal atoms (V, Mo, W, Nb), surface densities, and supports show a common increase in oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates with decreasing energies for oxygen-to-metal charge transitions. This reflects a concurrent decrease in the activation barriers for kinetically relevant CH bond activation steps as the energy level of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains decreases.

烷氧化脱氢反应涉及关键步骤如C-H键激活、M-烷基中间体和2H抽象。此过程的效率受到各种因素的影响，包括选择性和转化率、不同催化剂（本体金属氧化物和支持系统）的作用以及在实现高选择性和转化率方面的挑战。站点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着至关重要的作用。不同金属原子（V、Mo、W、Nb）、表面密度和支持系统的催化剂显示出共同的氧化脱氢转化率增加趋势，随着氧到金属电荷转移能级的降低。这反映了作为MOx域最低未占据状态的能量水平的并发下降导致的激活壁垒的降低，同时对动力学相关CH键激活步骤。
