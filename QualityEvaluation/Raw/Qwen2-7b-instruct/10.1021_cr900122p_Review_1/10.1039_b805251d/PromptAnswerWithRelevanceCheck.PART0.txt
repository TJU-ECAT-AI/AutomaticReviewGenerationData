[1] "Alkane and alkanol oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on supported MOx domains involve kinetically relevant CH bond breaking steps. These steps lead to the formal reduction of the metal centers in oxide domains and to marked effects of domain size, through their concomitant effects on electronic properties and reduction dynamics."

[2] "Supported MOx catalysts with different metal atoms (V, Mo, W, Nb), surface densities, and supports show a common increase in oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates with decreasing energies for oxygen-to-metal charge transitions. These universal trends reflect a concurrent decrease in the activation barriers for kinetically relevant CH bond activation steps as the energy level of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains decreases."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves intricate mechanisms and multiple factors that influence its efficiency, including the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. The process typically entails primary and secondary reactions, with the rates being dependent on the residence time of the reactants. 

In the context of catalysts, both bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in ODH. The reduction-oxidation cycles involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms, as proposed by Mars and van Krevelen, are key in this process. The reaction rates are often limited by the reduction step, which requires the activation of the weakest C-H bond in alkanes on pairs of lattice oxygen atoms located at the surface of reducible oxide domains. The ability of these domains to accept electrons plays a pivotal role, as it is governed by the position of the LUMO (DE2) as depicted in Scheme 3.

The size and dimensionality of the oxide domains, as well as the electronic properties of the catalyst, significantly influence the efficiency of ODH. Larger domains tend to have lower LUMO states and higher electron affinity, which facilitates the acceptance of electrons during the reduction step. This ability is reflected in the concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and the stabilization of transition states, indicating that larger domains can more efficiently activate the C-H bonds, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

Site isolation, a phenomenon where active sites are separated, plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. In the context of ODH, site isolation helps in preventing unwanted side reactions and promoting the desired formation of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2). By maintaining selective sites, the catalyst can achieve higher conversion and selectivity, thus enhancing the overall process efficiency.

In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is a complex process influenced by multiple factors. The choice of catalyst, its electronic properties, the size and dimensionality of the active sites, and the effectiveness of site isolation all contribute to its efficiency and selectivity. Understanding these interplays is crucial for developing more efficient catalysts and improving the process performance in industrial applications.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及复杂的机制和多个因素，影响其效率，包括催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化的挑战以及提出的反应机制。该过程通常包含初级和次级反应，其速率依赖于停留时间对烯烃和COx（CO和CO2）形成速率的影响。

在催化剂方面，包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统在内的各种催化剂都起着关键作用。Mars和van Krevelen首次提出的去离子和氧原子置换循环是这一过程的关键。反应速率往往受限于还原步骤，该步骤需要在可还原氧化物纳米粒子表面的氧原子对上激活烷烃中最弱的C-H键。这些纳米粒子接受电子的能力对催化性能具有重要影响，这取决于LUMO的位置（DE2），如方案3所示。

氧化物纳米粒子的大小和维度以及催化剂的电子性质显著影响ODH的效率。较大的纳米粒子倾向于具有较低的LUMO状态和更高的电负性，从而更容易在还原步骤中接受电子。这种能力体现在吸收边能量的并发变化和过渡态对C-H键断裂、OH和CO键形成的稳定化中，表明较大的纳米粒子可以更有效地激活C-H键，从而提高催化性能。

位点隔离，即活性位点分离现象，在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。在ODH的背景下，位点隔离有助于防止不需要的副反应并促进所需的烯烃和COx（CO和CO2）的形成。通过保持选择性位点，催化剂可以实现更高的转化率和选择性，从而增强整体过程效率。

综上所述，烷烃氧化脱氢是一个复杂的过程，受多个因素的影响。催化剂的选择、其电子性质、活性位点的大小和维度以及位点隔离的有效性都对效率和选择性有重要影响。理解这些交互作用对于开发更高效的催化剂和改善工业应用中的过程性能至关重要。

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it becomes clear that the efficiency of the process hinges on the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by affecting the energy barriers for key steps, such as CH bond activation, which is crucial for the reaction progress. Site isolation plays a pivotal role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the location and reactivity of active sites, thereby guiding the reaction pathway and product distribution.

In supported MOx catalysts, the size of the metal oxide domains, the metal atom type, surface density, and the nature of the support all contribute to the catalyst's reactivity. As the energy level of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains decreases, the activation barriers for kinetically relevant CH bond activation steps decrease, leading to increased turnover rates. This trend is observed universally across different metal atoms (V, Mo, W, Nb) and supports, reflecting the importance of electronic properties and reduction dynamics in determining the catalyst's performance.

While the general features influencing the reactivity of MOx-based catalysts in acid and oxidation chemistries are understood, the detailed understanding of the interplay between structure, composition, and energetics of intermediates and transition states remains a challenge. This complexity is particularly pronounced in reactions involving multiple steps and competing pathways, necessitating a deep insight into the specific structures of adsorbed species and transition states responsible for the observed chemical transformations.

在分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统）之间的相互作用对过程效率产生了显著影响。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于反应机制的复杂性，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-抽象。这些因素共同影响过程效率，通过影响关键步骤的能量壁垒，特别是C-H键活化步骤，这对于反应进展至关重要。

在支持的MOx催化剂中，金属氧化物纳米粒子的大小、金属原子类型、表面密度和支持性质都对催化剂的活性产生贡献。随着MOx纳米粒子最低未占据能级能量水平的降低，与键解离相关的激活能降低，导致了较高的转速。这一趋势普遍存在于不同金属原子（V、Mo、W、Nb）和支撑材料中，反映了电子特性和还原动力学对于催化剂性能的重要性。

虽然MOx基催化剂在酸性和氧化化学反应中的活性特征的总体特征是可理解的，但理解结构、组成与中间体和过渡态的热力学之间的相互作用仍是一个挑战。这种复杂性特别体现在涉及多个步骤和竞争路径的反应中，需要深入洞察吸附物种和过渡态的具体结构，以解释观察到的化学转化。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a process involving the conversion of alkanes into alkenes and COx (CO and CO2) through primary and secondary reactions. Catalysts used in this process can range from bulk metal oxides to supported systems, each influencing the efficiency of the reaction differently. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often stem from the complexity of the reaction pathways, including C-H bond activation, the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. 

In the case of MoOx and VOx, the catalytic process proceeds via reduction-oxidation cycles, which involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms following the Mars and van Krevelen pathways. The efficiency of these reactions is influenced by the ability of oxide domains to accept electrons during the activation of C-H bonds. This ability is reflected in the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains, which decrease in energy order Nb > W > Mo > V as the size of the oxide domains and the reducibility of the support increase.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the catalytic sites are distinct and not overly crowded. This is important because it helps prevent side reactions and ensures that the primary reaction pathway is followed efficiently. The extent of reduction during catalysis also impacts selectivity, as it is influenced by the reductant/oxidant ratio and the kinetic relevance of the CH bond activation steps.

Metal identity has a significant impact on both the LMCT absorption edge energy and the propane ODH turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the electronic properties of the catalyst, such as the energy level of the LUMO, are critical determinants of the reaction efficiency. By controlling these properties through the choice of metal and support, it is possible to tailor the catalyst for optimal performance in the ODH process.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及主反应和副反应，其速率可以通过停留时间对生成烯烃和COx（CO和CO2）的形成速率的影响来测量。催化剂可以是块状金属氧化物或支持系统，每种系统都会以不同的方式影响反应效率。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通常来自于复杂反应途径的影响，包括C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-摘除。

钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（VOx）的催化过程通过还原-氧化循环进行，这些循环涉及通过Mars和van Krevelen提出的路径去除和替换晶格氧原子。这些反应的效率受到氧化物域在C-H键活化期间接受电子的能力的影响。这种能力体现在MOx域最低未占据状态的能量水平上，这些能量水平遵循Nb > W > Mo > V的顺序递减，随着氧化物域的大小和支持材料的可还原性增加。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，确保催化位点不拥挤，有助于防止副反应并确保主要反应途径的有效执行。催化过程中的减少程度也影响选择性，因为它受还原剂/氧化剂比例和C-H键活化步骤的动态相关性的影响。

金属身份对两者都有重大影响：LMCT吸收边缘能量和丙烷ODH转速。这种相关性表明，催化剂的电子性质，如LUMO的能量水平，是决定反应效率的关键因素。通过控制这些性质，即选择金属和支持，有可能为ODH过程定制催化剂以获得最佳性能。
