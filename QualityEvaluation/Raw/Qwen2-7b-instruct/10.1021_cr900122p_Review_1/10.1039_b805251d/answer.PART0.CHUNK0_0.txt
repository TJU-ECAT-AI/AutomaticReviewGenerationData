[1] "Alkane and alkanol oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on supported MOx domains involve kinetically relevant CH bond breaking steps. These steps lead to the formal reduction of the metal centers in oxide domains and to marked effects of domain size, through their concomitant effects on electronic properties and reduction dynamics."

[2] "Supported MOx catalysts with different metal atoms (V, Mo, W, Nb), surface densities, and supports show a common increase in oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates with decreasing energies for oxygen-to-metal charge transitions. These universal trends reflect a concurrent decrease in the activation barriers for kinetically relevant CH bond activation steps as the energy level of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains decreases."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves breaking of C-H bonds, leading to the formal reduction of metal centers in the oxide domains. The size of the domains plays a crucial role, influencing electronic properties and reduction dynamics. Different MOx catalysts, with varying metal atoms, surface densities, and supports, exhibit an increase in turnover rates with decreasing energy levels for oxygen-to-metal charge transitions. This decrease in energy levels is associated with a reduction in activation barriers for the key C-H bond activation steps.

烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及到C-H键的断裂，导致金属中心在氧化物域中的正式还原。域的大小起着关键作用，影响电子性质和还原动力学。不同的MOx催化剂，具有不同的金属原子、表面密度和支持物，表现出随着氧到金属电荷转换能量水平的降低而增加的转化率。这种能量水平的降低与关键C-H键激活步骤的活化势垒的减少有关。
