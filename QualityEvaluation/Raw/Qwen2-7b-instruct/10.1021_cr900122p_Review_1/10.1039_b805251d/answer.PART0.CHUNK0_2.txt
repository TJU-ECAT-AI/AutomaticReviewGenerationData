[1] "Alkane and alkanol oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on supported MOx domains involve kinetically relevant CH bond breaking steps. These steps lead to the formal reduction of metal centers in oxide domains and to marked effects of domain size, through their concomitant effects on electronic properties and reduction dynamics."
[2] "Supported MOx catalysts with different metal atoms (V, Mo, W, Nb), surface densities, and supports show a common increase in oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates with decreasing energies for oxygen-to-metal charge transitions. These universal trends reflect a concurrent decrease in the activation barriers for kinetically relevant CH bond activation steps as the energy level of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains decreases."
[3] "The general features determining the reactivity of MOx based catalysts in acid and oxidation chemistries are more or less evident from these studies. The detailed understanding of the interplay of structure, composition, and the energies and entropies of intermediates and transition states in acid or oxidation elementary steps, which ultimately determine overall selectivities and rates, remains a challenge for all but a few simple reactions."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it becomes clear that the efficiency of the process hinges on the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency by affecting the energy barriers for key steps, such as CH bond activation, which is crucial for the reaction progress. Site isolation plays a pivotal role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the location and reactivity of active sites, thereby guiding the reaction pathway and product distribution.

In supported MOx catalysts, the size of the metal oxide domains, the metal atom type, surface density, and the nature of the support all contribute to the catalyst's reactivity. As the energy level of the lowest unoccupied states of the MOx domains decreases, the activation barriers for kinetically relevant CH bond activation steps decrease, leading to increased turnover rates. This trend is observed universally across different metal atoms (V, Mo, W, Nb) and supports, reflecting the importance of electronic properties and reduction dynamics in determining the catalyst's performance.

While the general features influencing the reactivity of MOx-based catalysts in acid and oxidation chemistries are understood, the detailed understanding of the interplay between structure, composition, and energetics of intermediates and transition states remains a challenge. This complexity is particularly pronounced in reactions involving multiple steps and competing pathways, necessitating a deep insight into the specific structures of adsorbed species and transition states responsible for the observed chemical transformations.

在分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支持系统）之间的相互作用对过程效率产生了显著影响。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于反应机制的复杂性，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H-抽象。这些因素共同影响过程效率，通过影响关键步骤的能量壁垒，特别是C-H键活化步骤，这对于反应进展至关重要。

在支持的MOx催化剂中，金属氧化物纳米粒子的大小、金属原子类型、表面密度和支持性质都对催化剂的活性产生贡献。随着MOx纳米粒子最低未占据能级能量水平的降低，与键解离相关的激活能降低，导致了较高的转速。这一趋势普遍存在于不同金属原子（V、Mo、W、Nb）和支撑材料中，反映了电子特性和还原动力学对于催化剂性能的重要性。

虽然MOx基催化剂在酸性和氧化化学反应中的活性特征的总体特征是可理解的，但理解结构、组成与中间体和过渡态的热力学之间的相互作用仍是一个挑战。这种复杂性特别体现在涉及多个步骤和竞争路径的反应中，需要深入洞察吸附物种和过渡态的具体结构，以解释观察到的化学转化。
