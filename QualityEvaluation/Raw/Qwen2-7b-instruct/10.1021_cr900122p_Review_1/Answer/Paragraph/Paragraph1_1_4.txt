Comprehensive analysis of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes: catalysts, challenges, reaction mechanisms, and process optimization.

            Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) include difficulties in C-H bond activation and alkyl intermediate generation, leading to byproduct formation. Key reaction mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation enhances selectivity by localizing reactions. La-based catalysts, like LaOCl, LaCl3, and La phases, are active for methane conversion to methyl chloride in the presence of hydrogen chloride and oxygen, showing high selectivity toward CH3Cl. These catalysts are stable over time, demonstrating their effectiveness in ODH processes. The proposed mechanism involves surface chlorine species activation by oxygen, leading to enhanced selectivity and process efficiency.

            More recently (2), research aims have shifted from functionalizing olefins to functionalizing the more abundant and less expensive paraffinic feedstocks, in an effort to meet future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs. In the area of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, several systems have emerged in recent years holding some promise for further study and development, particularly when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane. Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature. Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins. The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields. Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiCo molybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation.

            Supported Vanadium Oxide Catalysts. Molecular Structural Characterization and Reactivity Properties. These studies focus on the collective impact of catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts demonstrate their role in molecular structural characterization and reactivity properties, highlighting the importance of site isolation in enhancing selectivity. Insights from these studies underscore the pivotal role of catalysts and the need for optimized process parameters.

            These results parallel those of gas-phase studies involving 0- and alkanes. Although these reactions were carried out in a stoichiometric rather than a catalytic manner, we may expect that 0- is an important intermediate in the partial oxidation of alkanes. The partial oxidation of methane into more reactive chemicals such as methanol, ethylene, and other aliphatics is a current problem of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis. High molecular stability, however, makes it difficult to convert CH4 into other useful chemicals. Using molybdenum supported on silica, Lipatkina et al. also investigated the stoichiometric reaction of 0- with CH4 and confirmed the formation of CH3 radicals. Recent results from our laboratory have demonstrated that alkyl radicals, formed by the reaction between surface 0- ions and alkanes over Mo/SiO2 catalyst, are part of a catalytic cycle.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes. Propane combustion rates, however, are less affected by VOx surface density, which leads to a decrease in k2/k1 ratios as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, which causes the yield losses observed as conversion increases, is large (540) on VOx-based catalysts. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).

            Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach, and mechanistic problems have proved particularly challenging. Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica, alumina, titania, or AIPO4. Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts. We report here a study of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia in which the samples were characterized with Raman spectroscopy to understand the changes in the selectivities for maleic anhydride in the oxidation of butane. Phosphorus modification notably enhances the selectivity of catalysts, particularly in the partial oxidation of butane, leading to significant improvements in product selectivity even at low conversions.

            Recent reports have demonstrated that N20 is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. In an attempt to understand the role of 0- in the partial oxidation of methane, we investigated both the stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with 0- and the catalytic oxidation of CH4 with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica. Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C. Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The amounts of CH,OH and H2C0 increased with increasing amounts of water, and no decrease in activity has been observed in the presence of water. This may involve CH30- ions, and indeed zlkoxide ions are formed when C,-C,alkanes react with 0- ions on MgO. One cannot, however, exclude the possibility that at elevated temperatures hydroxyl radicals derived from water or Si-OH groups react with CH3- radicals to form CH,OW.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a challenging process due to the high activation barriers for C-H bond cleavage. The role of catalysts in ODH is crucial, especially in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems have been widely explored for ODH, each with their own advantages and limitations. Catalyst loading, support material, and reaction conditions significantly impact the efficiency of ODH. Proposed mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction pathways. High selectivity and conversion in ODH require careful optimization of the catalyst and reaction parameters.

            Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (eq 4). We also tested the V2O5·6SiO2 (34 wt % V2O5) xerogel that had been calcined at 500 C for its catalytic properties. Reactions conditions: 0.025 g of catalyst, 0.500 g of quartz chips, ambient pressure, feed ratio O2/C3H8/He of 8:25:200, flow rate range 30233 mL min-1. The selectivities and activities for propene formation, extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, were 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C.

            The extent of the CO, effect depends very much on the basicity of the catalyst. Similar increases in E, from 134 kJmol-' to 218 kJmol-' were found for methane conversion when CO, was added to the reagents during oxidative coupling. The role of CO, in improving C, selectivity from CH,, or C,H, selectivity from C,H,, is illustrated by the results in Table 3. The origin of this effect is not obvious, but the results suggest that CO, may poison sites that are uniquely capable of promoting the further oxidation of C,H, to CO,. The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH,.

            The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increased with increasing Cr content, and content of the support, and a maximal conversion was reached after 515 min on-stream. The initial reduction of Cr6 after exposing the catalyst to n-butane was responsible for the formation of and CO/CO2 cracking products and (C1, C2 C3). The dehydrogenation activity was proportional to the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction. Although the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2 species cannot be ruled out, it seems that Cr3 was more active than Cr2.

            在实现高选择性和转化率方面，氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）面临的挑战包括C-H键活化和烷基中间体生成的困难，导致副产品的形成。关键的反应机制涉及C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽取。位点隔离通过定位反应路径来增强选择性。镧（La）基催化剂，如LaOCl、LaCl3和La相（具有中间程度的氯化），在氢氯化物和氧气的存在下，对于甲烷转换为甲基氯化物是活跃的，显示出CH3Cl的高选择性。这些催化剂在长时间内保持稳定，证明了它们在ODH过程中的有效性。所提出的机制涉及表面氯物种由氧气激活，导致选择性的提高和过程效率的提升。

            更近（2），研究目标已转向利用更丰富且成本较低的芳香族原料进行功能化，以满足未来化学、纤维和聚合物需求。在芳烃氧化脱氢化领域，近年来出现了一些有前景的系统，特别适用于丙烷、异丁烷和正丁烷的应用。钼基化合物特别吸引人，因为它们在相对较低温度下表现出对丙烷激活的高活性。我们的研究表明，镍钴钼体系可作为V基催化剂用于轻质烷烃激活的替代品。钼含量极大地影响着催化活性和有用产物的产率。向NiCo钼化合物添加还原元素V、Fe、Ce和Cr可以增强活性，其中Cr添加表现出最大的潜力，保持高选择性并在较高转化率下实现期望的较低操作温度运行。

            支持的钒氧化物催化剂。分子结构表征和反应性质。这些研究侧重于催化剂的影响，包括整体金属氧化物和支持系统，对氧化脱氢烷烃过程的全面影响。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通过C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽取等反应机制得到解决。支持的钒氧化物催化剂显示了分子结构表征和反应性质的作用，强调了位点隔离在提高选择性方面的关键作用。这些研究结果强调了催化剂的作用及其对过程参数优化的需要。

            这些结果与涉及0-和烷烃的气体相研究一致。尽管这些反应是在定量而非催化的情况下进行的，但我们可能预期0-是烷烃部分氧化的重要中间体。甲烷的部分氧化转化为更活泼的化学物质，如甲醇、乙烯和其他直链化合物，是一个在异质催化中极具重要意义的问题。然而，由于大分子稳定性，将CH4转化为其他有用的化学品变得困难。使用二氧化硅支持的钼，Lipatkina等人也研究了0-与CH4的定量反应，并证实了CH3自由基的形成。最近来自我们实验室的结果表明，表面0-离子与烷烃在Mo/SiO2催化剂上反应形成的烷基自由基构成了一个催化循环。

            目前的挑战被讨论。可调的、选择性的碳氢化合物功能化仍然难以实现，而机制问题尤其具有挑战性。近年来，一些小组尝试在硅胶、氧化铝、钛酸盐或AIPO4上支持V-P-O催化剂。不幸的是，大多数支持的V-P-O催化剂在文献中报道的选择性，与未支持的催化剂相比，对马来酸酐生产的相对较低。我们在这里报告了一项研究，使用磷酸修饰的硅胶支持的钒，在氧化乙烷的但烷氧化中，通过拉曼光谱法理解了甲酸酐选择性的变化。磷酸修饰显著提高了催化剂的选择性，特别是在丁烷的部分氧化中，导致产品选择性在低转化率下显著改善。

            最近的报告表明，N20是支持钼氧化物的非常有效的氧化剂，在乙烷的氧化脱氢化过程中。试图理解在甲烷氧化中0-的作用，我们调查了CH4与0-的定量反应以及N20在二氧化钼上对CH4的催化氧化。甲醇在脱附温度超过300°C时被观察为主要产品。在实验条件下，硅胶的活性降低了大约10倍。水的量增加了，CH,OH和H2C0的量也随之增加，并且在水的存在下没有观察到活性下降。这可能涉及到CH30-离子，并且确实Zlk氧化物离子是在MgO上C,-C,烷烃反应时形成的。然而，不能排除在高温下水或Si-OH基团产生的羟基自由基与CH3-自由基反应形成CH,OW的可能性。

            氧化脱氢烷烃（ODH）是一个具有挑战性的过程，由于C-H键裂解的高活化壁垒。催化剂在ODH中的作用至关重要，特别是为了实现高选择性和转化率。整体金属氧化物和支持系统已经广泛地探索ODH，每种都有自己的优点和限制。催化剂负载、支撑材料和反应条件显著影响ODH的效率。ODH的提议机制包括C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成和2H抽取。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着至关重要的作用，通过限制反应途径。实现ODH高选择性和转化率需要仔细优化催化剂和反应参数。

            钒硅胶是丙烷氧化脱氢化最有效的催化剂之一(eq 4)。我们还测试了在500°C煅烧的34% V2O5硅胶多孔凝胶的催化性能。反应条件：0.025克催化剂、0.500克石英碎片、大气压力、O2/C3H8/He的进料比为8:25:200、流量范围30233毫升/分钟。丙烯形成的选择性和活动性，在0%丙烷转化率下外推，分别为86.6%和2.1毫摩尔/克小时在400°C，82.1%和5.6毫摩尔/克小时在450°C，以及73.2%和19毫摩尔/克小时在500°C。

            CO,的效果的大小很大程度上取决于催化剂的碱性。当CO,添加到氧化耦合反应物中时，从134千焦/mol增加到218千焦/mol。CO,在提高CH,或C,H,选择性方面的角色在表3的结果中得到了说明。这种效应的起源不明确，但结果表明CO,可能毒害那些能够促进C,H,进一步氧化为CO,的独特位点。氧化耦合反应中使用的催化剂的多样性使得不可能有一种类型的中心负责CH,的活化。

            支持的铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢化活性随着Cr含量的增加和支撑物含量的增加而增加，并在515分钟后达到最大转化率。暴露于n-丁烷的催化剂后Cr6的初始还原是形成和CO/CO2裂解产物以及(C1, C2 C3)的原因。脱氢化活性与Cr3形成成正比。虽然Cr2物种的脱氢化活性不能排除，似乎Cr3比Cr2更活跃。

5. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Further investigation into the environmental impacts of ODH processes, including the release of pollutants and the consumption of resources, could guide the development of more sustainable practices. This includes the optimization of process parameters to minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

6. **Scale-up and Industrial Application**: Scaling up ODH processes from lab to industrial size presents numerous challenges, including heat and mass transfer limitations, scaling laws, and equipment design. Collaborations between academia and industry are essential to overcome these hurdles and ensure the successful commercial implementation of ODH technologies.

By addressing these areas, researchers and engineers can advance the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, contributing to more efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically viable chemical processes.
