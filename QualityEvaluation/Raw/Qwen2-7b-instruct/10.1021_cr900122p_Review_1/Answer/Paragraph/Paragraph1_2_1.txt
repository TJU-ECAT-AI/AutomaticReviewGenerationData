        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jp9933875\].

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes struggles with low alkene yields due to secondary combustion, typically around 30%. Factors like vanadium oxide (VOx) surface density and Lewis acidity significantly affect catalyst performance. Higher redox properties and less acidic metal oxides enhance catalytic activity, reducing yield losses and increasing propene yield. The k3/k1 ratio, indicating yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. Understanding these dynamics aids in optimizing the ODH process, aiming to improve selectivity and conversion through site isolation strategies.

        Supported Vanadium Oxide Catalysts. Molecular Structural Characterization and Reactivity Properties. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) explores catalysts, notably supported vanadium oxide, addressing challenges in high selectivity and conversion. Reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation and 2H-abstraction, with M-alkyl intermediates. Site isolation is pivotal in tackling selectivity issues, as highlighted by studies on supported catalysts and molecular structural characterization. This approach optimizes ODH processes efficiently.

        Recent reports2 have demonstrated that N20 is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. Investigating oxygen ions (O-) in methane oxidation reveals their role in catalytic reactions with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica. Methanol emerges as the primary product at desorption temperatures above 300°C, with silica gel showing significantly lower activity than other catalysts. The presence of water enhances methanol production (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO), demonstrating its importance in the reaction mechanism. The formation of CH30- ions and zincoxide ions (ZnO2) upon reacting alkane molecules with O- ions on magnesium oxide (MgO) underscores the complexity of the reaction pathway. The possibility of hydroxyl radicals reacting with CH3 radicals to form CH3OW suggests a potential mechanism for the reaction's efficiency, emphasizing the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

        Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach. Mechanistic problems have proved particularly challenging. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, despite advancements. Homogeneous transition metal catalysts struggle to perform tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization, with underlying mechanisms—C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction—remaining particularly elusive. These challenges impact process efficiency, necessitating further research to address them effectively. Current studies highlight the importance of catalyst design and the need for a better understanding of reaction mechanisms to optimize the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

        One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step. Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant. The conversion of propene into acrolein and acrylonitrile (ammoxidation) using bismuthmolybdate catalysts is a well-known process. In all these processes, propene, whether the reactant or generated in situ, is converted via a CH bond activation involving a H-abstraction to generate a stabilized propenyl radical. Several catalysts can be used, including the well-known ammoxidation catalyst MoBiOx, but more complex systems have been developed involving multicomponent oxides based on MoVNbTaSbTe.... While Malkyl intermediates might be formed at lower temperatures, (120) the key step of this reaction is a H-abstraction, the formation of radical intermediates, and subsequent gas phase reactions.

        Bulk Metal Halides It is noteworthy that bulk metal halides and, in particular, LaCl3 catalyze several processes involving CH bond activation: for instance, the selective transformation of methane into chloromethane (Scheme 8) (125) and the hydrogenchlorine exchange between chlorinated hydrocarbons; for example, CHCl3 and CHCl3 are transformed into 2CH2Cl2 (eq 7). However, other active species such as small chromium oxide clusters are likely participating in the overall process. The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, (138, 139) to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species. Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a).

        Analyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts via calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides showcases the role of catalyst properties, particularly active site characteristics, in selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. With samples prepared at varying Cu/Th atomic ratios, the catalytic process involves oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane at 823 K under atmospheric pressure. Key findings reveal an increase in ethylene production selectivity with copper content, peaking at Cu/Th = 0.25, beyond which selectivity decreases. For propane, conversion rates are closely tied to copper concentration in ThO2 when Cu/Th < 0.25, stabilizing for higher ratios. Propene selectivity rises sharply with copper content, reaching a maximum at Cu/Th = 0.1 before declining with increased atomic ratios, demonstrating the pivotal role of site isolation in enhancing selectivity and conversion.

        More detailed elucidations of structurereactivity relationships are important for the development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts. The environment of the iron sites can further be modified by the presence of acidic groups or alkali metal ions. In a previous paper, we showed that the FeIII in the framework of MCM-41 was more efficient than the FeOx clusters for the conversion of CH4 to HCHO by O2. The partial oxidation of CH4 and the epoxidation of C3H6 were carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor (quartz tube) operated at atmospheric pressure. It should be noted that only ca. 0.1 wt% Fe could be incorporated into SBA-15 by the direct synthesis irrespective of the amount of iron added in the synthesis mixture possibly because SBA-15 was prepared in a strong acid medium.

        Effcient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts' development hinges on structural-reactivity insights. Tailoring iron site environments through acidic groups or alkali metals boosts activity and selectivity. Iron(III) in MCM-41 outperforms clusters for methane to formic acid conversion. Under atmospheric pressure, fixed-bed reactors execute methane partial oxidation and propene epoxidation. Challenges include synthesizing SBA-15 with limited iron, affecting catalytic efficiency. These aspects collectively inform catalyst optimization and process efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation.

        More recently (2), research aims have shifted from functionalizing olefins to functionalizing the more abundant and less expensive paraffinic feedstocks, in an effort to meet future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs. In the area of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, several systems have emerged in recent years holding some promise for further study and development, particularly when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane. Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature. Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins. The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields. Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiCo molybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation.

        Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes leverages various catalysts, notably metal oxides and supported systems, to enhance selectivity and conversion rates. Key challenges include understanding complex reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is pivotal for addressing selectivity issues. Recent studies highlight metal molybdates, particularly those incorporating nickel and cobalt, as viable alternatives to vanadium-based catalysts, offering high activity at low temperatures. These catalysts facilitate the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor, with the addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhancing activity, especially with chromium, promising higher selectivity at increased conversions and potentially lower process temperatures.

        Analyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, catalysts including bulk metal oxides and supported systems are crucial for efficiency. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through site isolation, enhancing process control. Mechanisms like C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction influence efficiency. Different catalysts, notably MgO and lithium-doped MgO, demonstrate varied activities due to their unique properties. Oxygen ions at low coordination sites facilitate hydrogen abstraction and radical formation, while lithium doping creates active sites for efficient reactions. Understanding these factors enables optimizing the process for better performance.

        The extent of the CO2 effect depends very much on the basicity of the catalyst. Similar increases in E, from 134 kJmol-' to 218 kJmol-' were found for methane conversion when CO2 was added to the reagents during oxidative coupling. The role of CO2 in improving C, selectivity from CH4, or C,H, selectivity from C,H, is illustrated by the results in Table 3. The origin of this effect is not obvious, but the results suggest that CO2 may poison sites that are uniquely capable of promoting the further oxidation of C,H, to CO2. One of the manifestations of this role of CO2 is the effect of residence time on selectivity. The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH4. The effect of the simultaneous presence of CH4 and 0, over the catalyst is illustrated by the results of Figure 5. The early discovery of Li/MgO as an effective oxidative coupling catalyst focused attention on [Li+O-] centers as possible sites for the activation of CH4. The [Li+O-] centers have also been observed in Li/ZnO catalysts, and the analogous [Na+O-] centers have been found in Na/CaO. Based upon high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and co-worker concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates function as the active centers on Li/MgO.

        The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increased with increasing Cr content, and content of the support, and a maximal conversion was reached after 515 min on-stream. The initial reduction of Cr6 after exposing the catalyst to n-butane was responsible for the formation of and CO/CO2 cracking products and (C1, C2 C3). The dehydrogenation activity was proportional to the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction. Although the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2 species cannot be ruled out, it seems that Cr3 was more active than Cr2.

        Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (eq 4). We also tested the V2O5·6SiO2 (34 wt % V2O5) xerogel that had been calcined at 500 C for its catalytic properties. Reactions conditions: 0.025 g of catalyst, 0.500 g of quartz chips, ambient pressure, feed ratio O2/C3H8/He of 8:25:200, flow rate range 30233 mL min-1. The selectivities and activities for propene formation, extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, were 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C. These results underscore the catalysts' capability for efficient ODH processes, particularly noting high selectivity at lower temperatures, indicative of controlled C-H bond activation and effective propene formation without secondary combustion.

        Introduction and Scope: The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions. ODH Reaction of Light Alkanes: The present global demand for light alkenes and their shortage is the consequence of their primary use as monomers/comonomers and a relative decrease in their production due to changes in operating conditions in catalytic cracking units. Types of Catalysts Used in ODH of Light Alkanes: One of them is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, which overcomes most of the obstacles mentioned above. Catalysts for ODH of Ethane: The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%). Mechanism of ODH of Alkanes: On the basis of the literature data, the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps: 1) Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption). 2) Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species. 3) Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene. Kinetic Models for ODH of Light Alkanes: The main models used for the kinetic description of oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes are: 1) Eley-Rideal model, 2) Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, 3) rake model, 4) Mars Van Krevelen modelthe redox model, and the 5) power law model. Kinetics of ODH of Ethane: Many papers have been devoted to the study of the catalytic properties of various materials used in ODHE, but few have considered the kinetic aspects of this reaction.

        The possible involvement of Pd(I1)-vinyli-dine and Pd(I1)-allenyl complexes could be excluded (26, 27). In the addition of alk-oxyarenes to activated alkenes, the involve-ment of the carbocations from alkenes may be possible. This process offers a general, simple, and efficient method for converting simple arenes directly to potentially useful compounds in one step under mild conditions. This method should have many applications in organic and medical chemistry and possibly be applied by chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

        Activity and spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that La-based catalysts (LaOCl, LaCl3, and La phases with an intermediate extent of chlorination) are active for methane conversion to methyl chloride in the presence of hydrogen chloride and oxygen (Figures 24). These La-based catalysts appear to be very stable: no deactivation was detected after three weeks of testing. Although LaCl3 was known as a catalyst promoter for hydrocarbon chlorination, it was never considered as a catalyst by itself because it was believed that a reducible metal was required for a catalytic site. At methane conversions below 12 mol %, the catalyst was 100% selective toward CH3Cl. Only trace amounts of CHCl3 were detected, and CCl4 was never detected. Based on this evidence, methane chlorination is proposed to proceed through the surface chlorine species that can be activated by oxygen. DFT calculations suggest that O2 can activate surface Cl- species by dissociatively adsorbing and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1 (Figure 5). The proposed catalytic cycle, thus, involves oxidation of a surface chlorine without any changes in the oxidation state of the underlying metal (eqs 1012), which is significantly different from known mechanisms of oxidative chlorination.

        The study highlights vanadium silicalite's effectiveness in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), achieving high propene selectivities (86.6%, 82.1%, and 73.2%) at 400, 450, and 500°C, respectively. Under conditions including a 0.025 g catalyst dosage, 0.500 g quartz chips, ambient pressure, and an O2/C3H8/He feed ratio of 8:25:200, the catalysts demonstrated significant propene production rates (2.1 mmol g-1 h-1, 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1, and 19 mmol g-1 h-1) across the specified temperatures. These results underscore the catalysts' capability for efficient ODH processes, particularly noting high selectivity at lower temperatures, indicative of controlled C-H bond activation and effective propene formation without secondary combustion.

        氧化脱氢反应（ODH）的烷烃面临低烯烃产率的问题，通常在30%左右，主要是由于次级燃烧限制了初级烯烃产品的产率。因素如二氧化钒（VOx）表面密度和拉曼酸性显著影响催化剂性能。更高氧化还原性质和较少酸性的金属氧化物可以增强催化活性，减少产率损失并提高丙烯产率。k3/k1比率，在转化增加时导致观察到的产率损失是大的（540），在VOx基催化剂上。了解这些动态有助于优化ODH过程，通过隔离位点策略优化选择性和转化率。

        支持的钒氧化物催化剂。分子结构表征和反应性质。在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，研究了包括支持的钒氧化物在内的催化剂，以解决高选择性和转化的挑战。反应机制包括C-H键活化和2H抽象，以及M-烷基中间体。位点隔离对于解决选择性问题至关重要，这在支持催化剂和分子结构表征的研究中得到了强调。这种方法优化了ODH过程的效率。

        最近的报告表明，N20是乙烷在二氧化钼支持的硅胶上的非常有效的氧化剂。在氧气离子（O-）在甲烷氧化中的作用研究中，揭示了它们在氧气氧化钼支持的硅胶上的催化反应。在300°C以上的脱附温度下，甲醇作为主要产物出现，硅胶的活性远低于其他催化剂。水的加入增强了甲醇（CH3OH）的生产，并增加了H2CO的数量，显示了其在反应机制中的重要性。CH30-离子和ZnO2（ZnO2）的形成，当烷烃分子与MgO上的O-离子反应时，表明了反应路径的复杂性。CH3OW的可能性表明反应效率的一种机制，强调了位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的重要作用。

        当前的挑战包括：难以实现可调的、选择性的碳氢化合物功能化；机制问题特别具有挑战性。烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）面临着实现高选择性和转化的重大挑战，尽管取得了进步。均相过渡金属催化剂在执行可调、选择性碳氢化合物功能化方面存在困难，其中C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽象等基本机制尤其难以解释。这些挑战影响了过程效率，需要进一步研究来解决这些问题。当前的研究强调了催化剂设计和对反应机制的更好理解对于优化ODH过程的重要性。

        一个关键问题是，烷二烯产品的氧化往往比起始烷烃更容易（更快）。ODH可以在各种批量金属氧化物（例如V2O5）上进行，但每次通过的产率很低。在所有情况下，CH键的断裂导致形成烷基物种。在乙烯转化为丙烯（eq 4）中，二氧化钒是效率最高的催化剂之一。我们还测试了34 wt % V2O5的V2O5·6SiO2无定形凝胶，在500°C下煅烧后的催化性能。反应条件：0.025克催化剂，0.500克石英芯片，大气压力，O2/C3H8/He进气比为8:25:200，流速范围为30233毫升/分钟。丙烯形成的选择性和活性，外推至0%丙烷转化，分别在400°C时为86.6%，在450°C时为82.1%，在500°C时为73.2%，每克小时分别为2.1毫米，5.6毫米和19毫米。这些结果强调了催化剂的能力，特别是注意到较低温度下的高选择性，暗示了受控的C-H键激活和有效的丙烯形成，而没有次级燃烧。

        引言和范围：建立化学反应机制的方法主要基于实验动力学依赖性与基于某些模型机制建立的理论方程之间的比较，这些机制被认为是对应条件下有效的。轻质烷烃的ODH反应：目前全球对轻质烯烃的需求及其短缺是由于它们作为单体/共聚物的主要用途以及催化裂解单元操作条件变化而导致其产量相对减少的结果。轻质烷烃的催化剂类型：其中之一是烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），它克服了上述大部分障碍。乙烯的催化剂：氯离子的主要效果是产生乙基自由基物种，这对于实现高于30%的乙烯产率至关重要。烷烃的ODH机制：根据文献数据，烷烃的ODH机制似乎涉及以下特征步骤：1）烷烃与催化剂表面的相互作用（弱/物理吸附）。2）CH键的断裂导致形成烷基物种。3）烷基物种与相邻表面氧的反应（b消除）和形成烯烃。轻质烷烃的ODH动力学模型：描述轻质烷烃氧化脱氢的动力学的主要模型有：1）埃利-里德模型，2）兰格缪尔-辛希尔伍德模型，3）枝模型，4）火星范克莱伦模型（还原模型），和5）幂律模型。乙烯的ODH动力学：关于各种材料在ODHE中使用的催化性质的研究论文很多，但很少考虑这一反应的动力学方面。

        可能涉及Pd(I1)-乙烯基二烯和Pd(I1)-亚乙烯基复合物的参与可以被排除（26, 27）。在芳基醚加成到活性双键的反应中，来自双键的碳正离子的参与可能是可能的。这个过程提供了一种通用、简单且高效的方法，将简单的芳环直接转化为潜在有用的化合物，在温和条件下一步完成。该方法在有机化学和医药化学中有许多应用，并可能被化学和制药行业采用。

        活性性和光谱测量表明，镧基催化剂（LaOCl、LaCl3和具有中间氯化程度的镧相）在氢氯化物和氧气的存在下对甲烷转换为甲基氯化物是活跃的（图24）。这些镧基催化剂看起来非常稳定：在测试后三周未检测到失活。虽然LaCl3一直被认为是一种促进碳氢化合物氯化的催化剂，但它从未被视为一种催化剂本身，因为人们认为需要可还原的金属来形成催化位点。在甲烷转化率低于12摩尔%时，催化剂对CH3Cl的选择性为100%。仅检测到微量的CHCl3，而CCl4从未被检测到。根据这些证据，甲烷氯化可能通过可以由氧气激活的表面氯化物进行。第一性原理计算表明，O2可以通过离解吸附和形成OCl-物种来激活表面Cl-物种，Cl的正式氧化状态从1变为+1（图5）。因此提出的催化循环涉及表面氯的氧化，而不改变底层金属的氧化状态（等式10-12），这与已知的氧化氯化机制显著不同。

        研究表明，范德萨里硅是丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中最有效的催化剂之一（等式4），实现了86.6%、82.1%和73.2%的丙烯选择性，分别在400、450和500°C下。在包括0.025克催化剂、0.500克石英芯片、大气压力和O2/C3H8/He进气比为8:25:200的条件下，催化剂在指定温度范围内分别产生了2.1毫摩尔/克小时、5.6毫摩尔/克小时和19毫摩尔/克小时的丙烯。这些结果强调了催化剂的能力，特别是在较低温度下的高选择性，暗示了受控的C-H键激活和有效的丙烯形成，而没有次级燃烧。
