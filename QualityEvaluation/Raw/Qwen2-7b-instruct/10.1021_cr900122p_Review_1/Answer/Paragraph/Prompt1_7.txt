Synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts via copper and thorium hydroxide calcination showcases the impact of varying Cu/Th ratios on catalyst efficiency. Key findings highlight an increase in ethylene selectivity with copper content up to 0.25, beyond which selectivity decreases. Propane conversion shows a direct correlation with copper concentration in ThO2 for ratios below 0.25, stabilizing at higher ratios. Propene selectivity peaks at a Cu/Th ratio of 0.1, then declines with increased ratios, underscoring the importance of site isolation for enhanced selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1007/bf02070119"},
