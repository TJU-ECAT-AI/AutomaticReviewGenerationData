            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1007/bf00812463\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1039/a801710g\] and \[10.1021/cr900122p_1\]. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) employs catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Challenges involve complex reactions and site isolation effects. Phosphorus modification boosts selectivity, notably in producing maleic anhydride through partial oxidation of butane. This enhances product selectivity, even at low conversions, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy studies on phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia catalysts. The study reveals significant changes in selectivity and VOPO4 compound formation, addressing the question on catalyst effectiveness and process optimization in ODH.

            Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions with catalysts, focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion faces challenges due to intricate mechanisms like C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation enhances selectivity by controlling reaction conditions. Chromium oxide catalysts' dehydrogenation activity rises with Cr content and support, peaking after 515 minutes. Chromium(VI) reduction initiates the process, forming alkenes through chromium(III), highlighting its role as the active species. The quotes substantiate the importance of chromium reduction and the catalytic activity's correlation with chromium(III) formation.

            Analyzing ODH, various catalysts like VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx, either in bulk or supported forms, are crucial for process efficiency. Challenges in high selectivity and conversion stem from the nature of catalysts and their ability to activate C-H bonds. Key factors include identifying active sites, the role of site isolation to address selectivity issues, and understanding common reaction intermediates. Catalysts facilitate activation through mechanisms such as H-abstraction, formation of alkyl or hydride intermediates, and insertion across metal-oxygen bonds. DFT calculations show that H-abstraction on terminal oxo species is energetically favorable, with chromium being the most efficient. Site isolation enhances product purity by preventing unwanted side reactions. In summary, effective ODH processes require precise catalyst manipulation, optimizing C-H bond activation, and controlling reaction pathways for high conversion and selectivity.

            Efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts' development hinges on understanding structural-reactivity relationships. Environmental adjustments through acidic groups or alkali metal ions enhance catalyst activity and selectivity. Iron(III) in MCM-41 excels in methane to formic acid conversion over iron oxides clusters. Atmospheric pressure facilitates partial methane oxidation and propene epoxidation in a quartz tube reactor. Despite potential for higher iron incorporation, SBA-15's synthesis in a strong acid medium limits it to 0.1 wt%. The quotes underscore the importance of these factors in catalyst performance and optimization.

            Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes struggles with low alkene yields (around 30% for propane) due to secondary combustion. Vanadium oxide (VOx) surface density impacts propane combustion rates less, affecting the k2/k1 ratio negatively as density increases. A high k3/k1 ratio, causing yield losses, is noted on VOx-based catalysts. Activation energy differences between propane ODH and propene combustion rise with increasing cation Lewis acidity. Metal oxides with high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield.

            Analyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process requires understanding catalysts' complex interactions, particularly bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion faces challenges due to C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Catalysts' ability to isolate active sites enhances process efficiency. Recent studies show that alkyl radicals, formed through reactions between surface 0- ions and alkanes over a molybdenum/silica catalyst, are integral to a catalytic cycle. These findings parallel gas-phase studies and confirm the significance of 0- in alkane oxidation. Molecular stability hinders methane conversion, highlighting the importance of optimized catalysts for enhanced yield and selectivity.

            The extent of the CO2 effect depends very much on the basicity of the catalyst. Similar increases in E, from 134 kJmol-' to 218 kJmol-', were found for methane conversion when CO2 was added to the reagents during oxidative coupling. The role of CO2 in improving C, selectivity from CH4 or C,H, selectivity from C,H, is illustrated by the results in Table 3. The origin of this effect is not obvious, but the results suggest that CO2 may poison sites that are uniquely capable of promoting the further oxidation of C,H, to CO2. One of the manifestations of this role of CO2 is the effect of residence time on selectivity. The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH4.

            Activity and spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that La-based catalysts (LaOCl, LaCl3, and La phases with an intermediate extent of chlorination) are active for methane conversion to methyl chloride in the presence of hydrogen chloride and oxygen. These La-based catalysts appear to be very stable: no deactivation was detected after three weeks of testing. Although LaCl3 was known as a catalyst promoter for hydrocarbon chlorination, it was never considered as a catalyst by itself because it was believed that a reducible metal was required for a catalytic site. At methane conversions below 12 mol %, the catalyst was 100% selective toward CH3Cl. Only trace amounts of CHCl3 were detected, and CCl4 was never detected. Based on this evidence, methane chlorination is proposed to proceed through the surface chlorine species that can be activated by oxygen. DFT calculations suggest that O2 can activate surface Cl- species by dissociatively adsorbing and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1. The proposed catalytic cycle involves oxidation of a surface chlorine without any changes in the oxidation state of the underlying metal, which is significantly different from known mechanisms of oxidative chlorination.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a challenging process due to the high activation barriers for C-H bond cleavage. The role of catalysts in ODH is crucial, especially in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems have been widely explored for ODH, each with their own advantages and limitations. Catalyst loading, support material, and reaction conditions significantly impact the efficiency of ODH. Proposed mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction pathways. High selectivity and conversion in ODH require careful optimization of the catalyst and reaction parameters.

            Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach. Mechanistic problems have proved particularly challenging. Introduction and scope: The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions. ODH reaction of light alkanes: The present global demand for light alkenes and their shortage is the consequence of their primary use as monomers/comonomers and a relative decrease in their production due to changes in operating conditions in catalytic cracking units. Types of catalysts used in ODH of light alkanes: One of them is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, which overcomes most of the obstacles mentioned above. Catalysts for ODH of ethane: The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%). Mechanism of ODH of alkanes: On the basis of the literature data, the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps: 1) Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption). 2) Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species. 3) Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene. Kinetic models for ODH of light alkanes: The main models used for the kinetic description of oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes are: 1) Eley-Rideal model, 2) Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, 3) rake model, 4) Mars Van Krevelen modelthe redox model, and the 5) power law model. Kinetics of ODH of ethane: Many papers have been devoted to the study of the catalytic properties of various materials used in ODHE, but few have considered the kinetic aspects of this reaction.
