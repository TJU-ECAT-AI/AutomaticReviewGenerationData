        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jp9933875\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1002/chin.199603284\], \[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\], and \[10.1039/c39820000078\]. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes struggles with low alkene yields due to secondary combustion, typically around 30%. Factors like vanadium oxide (VOx) surface density and Lewis acidity significantly affect catalyst performance. Higher redox properties and less acidic metal oxides enhance catalytic activity, reducing yield losses and increasing propene yield. The k3/k1 ratio, indicating yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. Understanding these dynamics aids in optimizing the ODH process, aiming to improve selectivity and conversion through site isolation strategies.

        Supported Vanadium Oxide Catalysts. Molecular Structural Characterization and Reactivity Properties. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) explores catalysts, notably supported vanadium oxide, addressing challenges in high selectivity and conversion. Reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation and 2H-abstraction, with M-alkyl intermediates. Site isolation is pivotal in tackling selectivity issues, as highlighted by studies on supported catalysts and molecular structural characterization. This approach optimizes ODH processes efficiently.

        Recent reports confirm nitrous oxide (N20) as an efficient oxidant in ethane dehydrogenation over supported molybdenum oxides, highlighting its effectiveness in the oxidative process. Investigating oxygen ions (O-) in methane oxidation reveals their role in catalytic reactions with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica. Methanol emerges as the primary product at desorption temperatures above 300°C, with silica gel showing significantly lower activity than other catalysts. The presence of water enhances methanol production (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO), demonstrating its importance in the reaction mechanism.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, despite advancements. Homogeneous transition metal catalysts struggle to perform tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization, with underlying mechanisms—C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction—remaining particularly elusive. These challenges impact process efficiency, necessitating further research to address them effectively.

        One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step. Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant.

        Conversion of propene into acrolein and acrylonitrile (ammoxidation) using bismuthmolybdate catalysts is a well-known process. In all these processes, propene, whether the reactant or generated in situ, is converted via a CH bond activation involving a H-abstraction to generate a stabilized propenyl radical. Several catalysts can be used, including the well-known ammoxidation catalyst MoBiOx, but more complex systems have been developed involving multicomponent oxides based on MoVNbTaSbTe....

        Bulk Metal Halides It is noteworthy that bulk metal halides and, in particular, LaCl3 catalyze several processes involving CH bond activation: for instance, the selective transformation of methane into chloromethane (Scheme 8) and the hydrogenchlorine exchange between chlorinated hydrocarbons; for example, CHCl3 and CHCl3 are transformed into 2CH2Cl2 (eq 7).

        Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a).

        Analyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts via calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides showcases the role of catalyst properties, particularly active site characteristics, in selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. With samples prepared at varying Cu/Th atomic ratios, the catalytic process involves oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane at 823 K under atmospheric pressure. Key findings reveal an increase in ethylene production selectivity with copper content, peaking at Cu/Th = 0.25, beyond which selectivity decreases. For propane, conversion rates are closely tied to copper concentration in ThO2 when Cu/Th < 0.25, stabilizing for higher ratios.

        Efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts' development hinges on structural-reactivity insights. Tailoring iron site environments through acidic groups or alkali metals boosts activity and selectivity. Iron(III) in MCM-41 outperforms clusters for methane to formic acid conversion. Under atmospheric pressure, fixed-bed reactors execute methane partial oxidation and propene epoxidation. Challenges include synthesizing SBA-15 with limited iron, affecting catalytic efficiency.

        Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes leverages various catalysts, notably metal oxides and supported systems, to enhance selectivity and conversion rates. Key challenges include understanding complex reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is pivotal for addressing selectivity issues. Recent studies highlight metal molybdates, particularly those incorporating nickel and cobalt, as viable alternatives to vanadium-based catalysts, offering high activity at low temperatures.

        With a C-H (first) bond energy of 104 kcaYmole and a weak interaction with most surfaces that is dominated by dispersion forces, methane seems to be the most difficult molecule among all organic substances to activate. Nevertheless, when it is reacted with water (steam reforming) over nickel catalysts, it dehydrogenates completely to produce CO and Hz by an endothermic process. The purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility of partial oxidation of methane under atmospheric pressure conditions.

        The extent of the CO, effect depends very much on the basicity of the catalyst. Similar increases in E, from 134 kJmol-' to 218 kJmol-' were found for methane conversion when CO, was added to the reagents during oxidative coupling. The role of CO, in improving C, selectivity from CH,, or C,H, selectivity from C,H,, is illustrated by the results in Table 3.

        The origin of this effect is not obvious, but the results suggest that CO, may poison sites that are uniquely capable of promoting the further oxidation of C,H, to CO,. One of the manifestations of this role of CO, is the effect of residence time on selectivity. The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH,.

        The dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increased with increasing Cr content, and content of the support, and a maximal conversion was reached after 515 min on-stream. The initial reduction of Cr6 after exposing the catalyst to n-butane was responsible for the formation of and CO/CO2 cracking products and (C1, C2 C3). The dehydrogenation activity was proportional to the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction. Although the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2 species cannot be ruled out, it seems that Cr3 was more active than Cr2.

        Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (eq 4). We also tested the V2O5·6SiO2 (34 wt % V2O5) xerogel that had been calcined at 500 C for its catalytic properties. Reactions conditions: 0.025 g of catalyst, 0.500 g of quartz chips, ambient pressure, feed ratio O2/C3H8/He of 8:25:200, flow rate range 30233 mL min-1. The selectivities and activities for propene formation, extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, were 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C.

        Introduction and Scope: The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions. ODH Reaction of Light Alkanes: The present global demand for light alkenes and their shortage is the consequence of their primary use as monomers/comonomers and a relative decrease in their production due to changes in operating conditions in catalytic cracking units. Types of Catalysts Used in ODH of Light Alkanes: One of them is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, which overcomes most of the obstacles mentioned above.

        Catalysts for ODH of Ethane: The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%). Mechanism of ODH of Alkanes: On the basis of the literature data, the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps: 1) Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption). 2) Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species. 3) Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.

        Kinetic Models for ODH of Light Alkanes: The main models used for the kinetic description of oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes are: 1) Eley-Rideal model, 2) Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, 3) rake model, 4) Mars Van Krevelen modelthe redox model, and the 5) power law model. Kinetics of ODH of Ethane: Many papers have been devoted to the study of the catalytic properties of various materials used in ODHE, but few have considered the kinetic aspects of this reaction.

        Activity and spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that La-based catalysts (LaOCl, LaCl3, and La phases with an intermediate extent of chlorination) are active for methane conversion to methyl chloride in the presence of hydrogen chloride and oxygen (Figures 24). These La-based catalysts appear to be very stable: no deactivation was detected after three weeks of testing. Although LaCl3 was known as a catalyst promoter for hydrocarbon chlorination, it was never considered as a catalyst by itself because it was believed that a reducible metal was required for a catalytic site.

        At methane conversions below 12 mol %, the catalyst was 100% selective toward CH3Cl. Only trace amounts of CHCl3 were detected, and CCl4 was never detected. Based on this evidence, methane chlorination is proposed to proceed through the surface chlorine species that can be activated by oxygen. DFT calculations suggest that O2 can activate surface Cl- species by dissociatively adsorbing and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1 (Figure 5). The proposed catalytic cycle, thus, involves oxidation of a surface chlorine without any changes in the oxidation state of the underlying metal (eqs 1012), which is significantly different from known mechanisms of oxidative chlorination.

        Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica [4-6], alumina [7,8], titania [4,7,9] or AIPO4 [10]. Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts. We report here a study of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia in which the samples were characterized with Raman spectroscopy to understand the changes in the selectivities for maleic anhydride in the oxidation of butane. Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly.

        At low conversions, PV0.0 produced primarily a mixture of 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene but very little maleic anhydride [12].

        基于\[10.1021/jp9933875\]参考文献的深度分析。从\[10.1002/chin.199603284\]、\[10.1016/s0360-0564(08)60093-0\]和\[10.1039/c39820000078\]的参考文献中获得的综合理解。氧化脱氢（ODH）烷烃在低烯烃产率方面遇到挑战，通常约为30%，这是由于副燃烧限制了烯烃产量。因素如二氧化钒（VOx）表面密度和Lewis酸度显著影响催化剂性能。更高的氧化还原特性和较少的酸性金属氧化物可以提高催化活性，减少损失并增加丙烯产量。k3/k1比率，表明随着转化率的增加而产生的损耗，对VOx基催化剂特别高。了解这些动态有助于优化ODH过程，旨在通过站点隔离策略提高选择性和转化率。

        支持的钒氧化物催化剂。分子结构表征和反应性质。烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）探索催化剂，特别是支持的钒氧化物，解决了高选择性和转化率的挑战。反应机制包括C-H键活化和2H抽象，以及M-烷基中间体。通过支持催化剂和分子结构表征研究，站点隔离在解决选择性问题方面至关重要。这种方法优化了ODH过程的效率。

        最近的研究确认，硝酸氧化氮（N20）是支持钼氧化物的高效氧化剂，用于乙烷脱氢，强调其在氧化过程中的有效性。在氧离子（O-）在甲烷氧化中探究氧离子（O-）的作用，发现它们在氧氧化物上与二氧化硅支持的硫化物进行催化反应。在300°C以上的脱附温度下，甲醇作为主要产品产生，而硅胶表现出显著较低的活性。水的存在增加了甲醇的生产（CH3OH）和二氧化碳（H2CO），表明其在反应机制中的重要性。

        烷烃氧化脱氢面临实现高选择性和转化率的重大挑战，尽管有进展。均相过渡金属催化剂难以执行可调的、选择性的碳氢化合物功能化，其中C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽象等基础机制尤其难以捉摸。这些挑战影响过程效率，需要进一步研究以有效解决它们。

        一个关键问题是，烷基产物的氧化往往更容易（更快）而不是起始烷烃的氧化。烷烃可以在各种批量金属氧化物（例如V2O5）上进行氧化脱氢，但每次通过的产率非常低。C-H键断裂导致形成烷基物种是速率决定步骤。再次，烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），尤其是乙烯，需要高于600°C的相对高温度，对于同质气体相反应可能是主导的。

        丙烯转化为丙烯醛和丙烯腈（氨氧化）使用铋钼酸盐催化剂是一个众所周知的过程。在所有这些过程中，无论是作为反应物还是在原位生成的丙烯，都通过H抽象转化为稳定的丙烯基自由基进行C-H键激活。可以使用几种催化剂，包括众所周知的氨氧化催化剂MoBiOx，但已经开发出基于MoVNbTaSbTe...的更复杂的复合氧化物系统。

        批量金属卤化物值得注意的是，特别是LaCl3催化涉及CH键激活的几个过程：例如，甲烷的选择性转化为氯甲烷（方案8）和氯化氢交换之间的氯化氢；例如，CHCl3和CHCl3被转化为2CH2Cl2（等式7）。

        尽管催化剂表面状态的复杂性，已经形成了共识：活性位点可能对应于孤立的Cr3+在一个类八面体环境中（方案9a）。

        分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），通过煅烧铜和钍氢氧化物合成的铜钍氧化物催化剂展示了催化剂属性的作用，特别是活性位点特性，在选择性氢化和脱氢中。样品在不同的Cu/Th原子比下制备，催化过程涉及在823 K下的乙烷和丙烷在大气压力下的氧化脱氢。关键发现揭示了随铜含量增加而增加的乙烷选择性，峰值出现在Cu/Th = 0.25，之后选择性降低。对于丙烷，转换率与在Cu/Th < 0.25时的铜浓度在ThO2密切相关，稳定了较高的比率。

        高效铁基异质选择性氧化催化剂的发展依赖于结构反应性见解。通过酸性基团或碱金属离子调整铁位点提高了活性和选择性。铁(III)在MCM-41中优于簇集，用于甲烷到甲醛的转换。在大气压力下，固定床反应器执行甲烷部分氧化和丙烯环氧化。合成SBA-15中的铁量有限，影响催化效率的挑战。

        烷烃氧化脱氢利用各种催化剂，特别是金属氧化物和支持系统，以提高选择性和转化率。主要挑战包括理解复杂反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽象。通过站点隔离解决选择性问题至关重要。最近的研究强调钼基合金，特别是那些包含镍和钴的催化剂，作为范德华基催化剂的可行替代品，提供低温下的高活性。

        甲烷的第一个C-H键能为104 kcaYmole，与大多数表面的弱相互作用被表面间作用力主导，使其成为最难活化的有机物质之一。然而，当它与水（蒸汽重整）在镍催化剂上反应时，它会完全脱氢化，产生CO和Hz，这是一个吸热过程。这项工作的目的是在大气压力条件下调查甲烷的部分氧化的可能性。

        CO的效应程度很大程度上取决于催化剂的碱性。在氧化耦合过程中向反应物中添加CO时，从134 kJmol-’增加到218 kJmol-’发现了相似的增加。CO在提高CH或C选择性方面的角色，从CH，或C选择性从C，选择性，如表格3所示。

        这种效果的原因尚不明显，但结果表明，CO可能毒化唯一能够促进C进一步氧化到CO的独特位点。CO的一个表现形式是停留时间对选择性的影响。氧化耦合反应使用的催化剂类型多样性使得不可能认为单一类型的中心是负责CH激活的原因。

        支持的铬氧化物催化剂的脱氢活性随Cr含量和支撑物含量的增加而增加，并在515分钟后达到最大转化率。暴露于正丁烷后，Cr6的初始还原导致形成和CO/CO裂解产物和(C1, C2 C3)。脱氢活性与Cr3形成成比例，Cr6还原。虽然Cr2物种的存在不能排除，但似乎Cr3比Cr2更活跃。

        硅酸盐型钒是丙烷氧化脱氢（eq 4）最有效的催化剂之一。我们还测试了34 wt % V2O5的多孔凝胶在500°C下煅烧后的催化性能。反应条件：0.025克催化剂，0.500克石英芯片，大气压力，氧气/丙烷/氦气比例为8:25:200，流速范围30233毫升/分钟。丙烯形成的选择性和活性，在0%丙烷转化率的情况下外推，分别为86.6%和2.1毫米/克小时在400°C，82.1%和5.6毫米/克小时在450°C，以及73.2%和19毫米/克小时在500°C。

        引言和范围：建立化学反应机制的程序主要是基于实验动力学依赖性与在相应条件下假设有效的一些模型机制和理论方程的比较。轻烷烃的ODH反应：目前全球对轻烯烃的需求和短缺是由于它们作为单体/共聚物的主要用途及其生产在催化裂解单元操作条件变化时的相对减少的结果。轻烷烃的ODH催化剂：其中之一是烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），它克服了上述大部分障碍。

        乙烷的催化剂：氯离子的主要作用是产生乙基自由基物种，这对实现30%以上的乙烯收率至关重要。烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的机制：根据文献数据，烷烃的ODH机制似乎涉及以下特征步骤：1) 与催化剂表面的烷烃相互作用（弱/物理吸附）。2) C-H键断裂导致形成烷基物种。3) 烷基物种与相邻表面氧的反应（β-消除）并形成烯烃。

        ODH轻烷烃的动力学模型：描述轻烷烃氧化脱氢的主要模型是：1) Eley-Rideal模型，2) Langmuir-Hinshelwood模型，3) 树模型，4) Mars Van Krevelen模型（还原模型）和5）幂律模型。乙烷ODH的动力学：许多论文致力于研究用于ODHE的各种材料的催化性质，但很少考虑该反应的动力学方面。

        活性与光谱测量证明，La基催化剂（LaOCl、LaCl3和具有中间氯化程度的La相）在氢氯化物和氧气存在下将甲烷转化为甲基氯化物（图24）。这些La基催化剂看起来非常稳定：测试后未检测到任何失活。尽管LaCl3作为碳氢化合物氯化物的催化剂促进剂而为人所知，但它从未被视为催化剂本身，因为人们认为可还原的金属是催化位点所需的。

        在低于12摩尔%的甲烷转化率下，催化剂对CH3Cl的纯选择性为100%。仅检测到少量的CHCl3，从未检测到CCl4。基于这些证据，甲烷氯化被认为通过可以由氧气激活的表面氯化物进行。DFT计算表明，O2可以通过分解吸附和形成OCl-物种来激活表面Cl-物种，Cl的正式氧化状态从1变为+1（图5）。因此提出的催化循环涉及表面氯化物的氧化，而不改变底层金属的氧化状态（等式1012），这与已知的氧化氯化机制显著不同。

        近年来，有几个小组试图在硅胶、[4-6]、氧化铝、[7,8]、二氧化钛、[4,7,9]或AIPO4 [10]上支持V-P-O催化剂。不幸的是，文献中报道的大多数支持V-P-O催化剂的相对选择性较差，与无支持催化剂相比，对马来酸酐的生产。在这里，我们报告了磷改性硅胶支持的钒的实验，通过拉曼光谱法研究了丁烷氧化的马来酸酐产物选择性的变化，以理解选择性变化。

        在低转化率下，PV0.0主要产生1-丁烯、反式-2-丁烯、顺式-2-丁烯和1,3-丁二烯，但几乎没有马来酸酐[12]。
