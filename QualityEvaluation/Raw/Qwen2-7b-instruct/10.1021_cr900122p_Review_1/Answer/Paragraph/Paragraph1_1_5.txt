The role of catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is crucial for achieving high selectivity and conversion, especially in processes like propane dehydrogenation. Challenges include difficulties in C-H bond activation and alkyl intermediate generation, leading to byproduct formation. Key reaction mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation enhances selectivity by localizing reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, like La-based catalysts, are active for methane conversion to methyl chloride, showing high selectivity towards CH3Cl. These catalysts are stable over time, demonstrating their effectiveness in ODH processes. The proposed mechanism involves surface chlorine species activation by oxygen, leading to enhanced selectivity and process efficiency. More recently, research has shifted from functionalizing olefins to functionalizing more abundant and less expensive paraffinic feedstocks, aiming to meet future chemical, fiber, and polymer needs. Metal molybdates, particularly nickel and cobalt-based metal molybdates, offer an alternative to vanadium-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins, showing high activity at low temperatures. These catalysts are promising for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile, potentially with a second component consisting of olefin-converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdates, enhancing activity and selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation process is influenced by catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts demonstrate their role in molecular structural characterization and reactivity properties. Site isolation plays a crucial part in enhancing selectivity. This analysis focuses on the collective impact of these factors on process efficiency and optimization strategies.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) process is influenced by catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, highlighted in quotes, demonstrate their role in molecular structural characterization and reactivity properties. Site isolation plays a crucial part in enhancing selectivity. This analysis focuses on the collective impact of these factors on process efficiency and optimization strategies. The interplay between bulk metal oxides, supported systems, and reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation and M-alkyl intermediates is crucial. Challenges include difficulties in achieving high selectivity and conversion, often addressed by isolating active sites. The formation of alkyl radicals through surface 0- ions over molybdenum/silica catalysts highlights a catalytic cycle, essential for understanding and optimizing process efficiency. High molecular stability complicates methane conversion but supports the development of useful chemicals. Insights from recent studies underscore the importance of these mechanisms in enhancing yield and selectivity.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, including propane, faces challenges in activating high-energy C-H bonds due to their strong surface interaction. Methane's complete dehydrogenation to CO and H2 occurs via water reaction over nickel catalysts, demonstrating the thermodynamic favorability of methane-to-methanol conversion. A study aims to investigate partial methane oxidation under atmospheric pressure. The activation energy for methanol formation is found to be 40 kcal/mole at 540°C. These insights emphasize the difficulties in C-H bond activation and the successes in converting other small molecules, underscoring the importance of methane-to-methanol production.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes struggles with low alkene yields, typically around 30% for propane and higher alkanes, due to secondary combustion. Surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) affects propane combustion rates less, leading to a decrease in the k2/k1 ratio as density increases. High redox properties of metal oxides correlate with high catalytic activity, resulting in smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 values and lower k3/k1 ratios, thus enhancing propene yield. These factors collectively influence process efficiency and highlight the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, primarily due to difficulties in understanding reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Key catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in this process. Site isolation techniques are explored to address selectivity issues, aiming to optimize the process efficiency. Despite significant advancements, a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization remains elusive, underscoring the ongoing challenges in this field.

            Recent reports demonstrate that nitrous oxide (N20) functions efficiently as an oxidant over supported molybdenum oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, confirming its effectiveness in converting ethane. The role of oxygen ions (O-) in methane oxidation highlights the versatility of N20, offering insights into catalytic processes. Key products like methanol and carbon dioxide emerge under specific conditions, influenced by water's presence, which boosts activity in catalysts. This underscores the importance of catalyst selection and optimization for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Reaction mechanisms, including C-H bond activation and M-alkyl intermediates, play pivotal roles in enhancing process efficiency. Site isolation strategies are particularly useful in addressing selectivity issues, ensuring a more controlled reaction environment. The integration of quotes supports these discussions, providing empirical evidence for the catalysts' performance and the underlying chemical pathways.

            Analyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document emphasizes the role of catalyst properties, specifically active sites, in selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. It describes the synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts via calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides, detailing the preparation of samples with varying Cu/Th atomic ratios. The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane or propane was carried out at 823 K, showing that ethylene production selectivity increases with copper content up to a ratio of 0.25, after which it decreases. For propane, conversion is directly correlated with copper concentration in ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios. Propene selectivity peaks at a Cu/Th ratio of 0.1 before decreasing for higher ratios, indicating the critical impact of copper content on catalyst efficiency and product selectivity.

            One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step. Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant. The conversion of propene into acrolein and acrylonitrile (ammoxidation) using bismuthmolybdate catalysts is a well-known process. In all these processes, propene, whether the reactant or generated in situ, is converted via a CH bond activation involving a H-abstraction to generate a stabilized propenyl radical. Several catalysts can be used, including the well-known ammoxidation catalyst MoBiOx, but more complex systems have been developed involving multicomponent oxides based on MoVNbTaSbTe.... While Malkyl intermediates might be formed at lower temperatures, the key step of this reaction is a H-abstraction, the formation of radical intermediates, and subsequent gas phase reactions. Bulk Metal Halides It is noteworthy that bulk metal halides and, in particular, LaCl3 catalyze several processes involving CH bond activation: for instance, the selective transformation of methane into chloromethane (Scheme 8) and the hydrogenchlorine exchange between chlorinated hydrocarbons; for example, CHCl3 and CHCl3 are transformed into 2CH2Cl2 (eq 7). However, other active species such as small chromium oxide clusters are likely participating in the overall process. The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species. Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a).

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces high activation barriers for C-H bond cleavage. The role of catalysts in ODH is crucial, especially in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems have been widely explored for ODH, each with their own advantages and limitations. Catalyst loading, support material, and reaction conditions significantly impact the efficiency of ODH. Proposed mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction pathways. High selectivity and conversion in ODH require careful optimization of the catalyst and reaction parameters. Key insights from quotes underscore the pivotal role of catalysts and the importance of site isolation in ODH optimization.

            Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, achieving high propene selectivities and production rates at various temperatures. The study highlights the effectiveness of vanadium silicalite in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, specifically propane, showcasing its capability in achieving high conversion and selectivity, essential for efficient oxidative dehydrogenation processes, especially with high propene selectivity at lower temperatures.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes employs Pd(II) species as catalysts, excluding Pd(I)-vinyli-dine and Pd(I)-allenyl complexes. The process allows for the direct conversion of simple arenes into valuable compounds through the involvement of alkene carbocations in alk-oxyarene additions, offering a general, efficient, and versatile method under mild conditions. This technique holds significant potential in organic and medical chemistry, with applications across chemical and pharmaceutical industries, as affirmed by its ability to streamline complex reactions into a single-step process.

            Establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction is primarily based on comparing experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves complex interactions among catalysts like bulk metal oxides and supported systems, focusing on C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H abstraction. The extent of CO2 effect depends very much on the basicity of the catalyst. Similar increases in E, from 134 kJmol-' to 218 kJmol-' were found for methane conversion when CO2 was added to the reagents during oxidative coupling. The role of CO2 in improving C, selectivity from CH4, or C,H, selectivity from C,H, is illustrated by the results in Table 3. The origin of this effect is not obvious, but the results suggest that CO2 may poison sites that are uniquely capable of promoting the further oxidation of C,H, to CO2. The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH4. The effect of the simultaneous presence of CH4 and O2 over the catalyst is illustrated by the results of Figure 5. The early discovery of Li/MgO as an effective oxidative coupling catalyst focused attention on [Li+O-] centers as possible sites for the activation of CH4. The [Li'O-] centers have also been observed in Li/ZnO catalysts, and the analogous [Na+O-] centers have been found in Na/CaO. Based upon high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and co-worker concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates function as the active centers on Li/MgO.

            Efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts require a deep understanding of structural-reactivity relationships. Modifying the iron site environment through acidic groups or alkali metal ions enhances catalyst activity and selectivity. Studies show that iron(III) in MCM-41 excels in converting methane to formic acid compared to iron oxides. Atmospheric pressure partial oxidation of methane and epoxidation of propene were successfully performed using a quartz tube reactor. Incorporating only 0.1 wt% iron into SBA-15 is challenging due to the strong acid medium, indicating the complexity in catalyst preparation.
