Future research endeavors might focus on the development of catalysts with enhanced selectivity, the optimization of reaction conditions to improve efficiency, and the integration of novel materials to broaden the scope of alkane dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the fundamental reaction mechanisms, including the detailed characterization of active sites and the exploration of new reaction pathways. The integration of computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), could provide valuable insights into the electronic structures and energetics of key intermediates, aiding in the rational design of catalysts and the prediction of optimal reaction conditions.

Scheme 5
Scheme 5. Oxidation of Butane into Maleic Anhydride on VPO Catalyst: (a) Reaction Intermediates; (b) Most Commonly Accepted Mechanism for the Formation of 2-Butene
The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities. ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra). Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities. In all cases, the C−H bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step. Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 °C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant. It has been proposed that C−H bond activation probably leads to M−alkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6). An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b). (98, 103) The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation.
Scheme 6
The conversion of propene into acrolein and acrylonitrile (ammoxidation) using bismuth−molybdate catalysts is a well-known process (eqs 1 and ), (106, 107) and the corresponding ammoxidation process of propane has been developed (eq 3). (92, 108) This process involves propene as a key intermediate, and the subsequent elementary steps are those of propene ammoxidation. Note however that the ammoxidation of propane requires much higher reaction temperatures (>500 °C) and longer residential time than that of propene and that the conversion of propane into propene is not catalyzed and involves mainly a gas phase reaction. In all these processes, propene, whether the reactant or generated in situ, is converted via a C−H bond activation involving a H-abstraction to generate a stabilized propenyl radical (Scheme 7). (109) Considering the number of subsequent steps, the selectivity is therefore a critical issue, and it relies on site isolation of active phases (note the difference with single-site catalysts): a too high density leads to combustion of propene and a too low density to the formation of allyl radical, thus leading to C6 byproduct. (110) Several catalysts can be used, including the well-known ammoxidation catalyst MoBiOx, but more complex systems have been developed involving multicomponent oxides based on Mo−V−Nb−Ta−Sb−Te.... (111-113) Similarly, the conversions of propane into acrylic (eq 4) and of 2-methylpropane into methacrylic acid (eq 5) have been studied in detail with similar types of catalysts: VPO, bismuth-molybdate catalysts, and multicompenent oxide catalysts, e.g. Mo−V−Te(Sb). (114, 115)
Scheme 7
Finally, oxidative coupling of methane into ethylene has also been extensively studied (eq 6), and it is catalyzed by bulk oxides and particularly alkaline earth oxides (MgO) (116, 117) or rare earth oxides (La2O3), (106) typically doped with alkali ions (Li). (118, 119) While M−alkyl intermediates might be formed at lower temperatures, (120) the key step of this reaction is a H-abstraction, the formation of radical intermediates, and subsequent gas phase reactions. (121-123) This limits the selectivity of this reaction: currently, 80% C2 selectivity at 20% conversion (with a projected maximum of 30% yield). (124)
Bulk Metal Halides
It is noteworthy that bulk metal halides and, in particular, LaCl3 catalyze several processes involving C−H bond activation: for instance, the selective transformation of methane into chloromethane (Scheme 8) (125) and the hydrogen−chlorine exchange between chlorinated hydrocarbons; for example, CHCl3 and CHCl3 are transformed into 2CH2Cl2 (eq 7). (126) In contrast to the chlorination of methane by Cl2, which involves a radical chain reaction (eq 8), the reaction catalyzed by LaCl3 yields selectively CH3Cl. The conversion of methane into chloromethane, catalyzed at 400 °C by LaCl3, requires HCl and O2, (125) and the C−H bond activation occurs at the surface of the material on LaClO sites, which are generated by the partial oxidation of the surface chloride of LaCl3 by O2. The oxide is then transformed back into the chloride material by exchange with HCl, and water is desorbed. In the absence of O2, LaClO is consumed and LaCl3 becomes inactive.

Supported Transition-Metal Oxides
These systems have been widely studied in the past decades, in particular because of their catalytic properties, which allow a broad range of catalytic alkane transformations: alkane dehydrogenation (18, 127) and oxidative dehydrogenation as well as selective oxidation of alkanes. (98, 128-131) Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting. These systems are characterized by the presence of isolated sites or small clusters at a low surface coverage; with bulk oxides being formed only at higher surface coverage (above a monolayer). (106, 110) Independently of the catalysts and the reactions, the C−H bond activation is often the rate determining step. We will discuss in a first part the dehydrogenation of alkanes and then in a second part both the oxidative dehydrogenation and selective oxidation of alkanes into oxygenates, because they have common reaction intermediates.
Dehydrogenation of Alkanes
The CATOFIN process, which is used to produce propene and isobutene from the corresponding alkanes, is performed with catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on alumina. (18, 127) Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a). (136, 137) However, other active species such as small chromium oxide clusters are likely participating in the overall process. The current proposed mechanism involves the C−H bond activation on a Cr−OS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, (138, 139) to form the alkene and a CrIII−H surface species. While the direct elimination of H2 from this species is highly disfavored, the subsequent C−H bond activation on this intermediate via a favorable σ-bond metathesis step leads to a new M−alkyl intermediate and thereby to a viable catalytic pathway (Scheme 9b). One of the problems of this process is its high endothermicity and the low associated conversion. This is compensated by the use of high reaction temperatures, which are accompanied by a deactivation of the catalyst via coke formation. Therefore, research efforts have concentrated on finding more stable catalysts using different supports (SiO2, ZrO2, ...) (106) or on using promoters such as CO2, which can displace the equilibrium and slow down coke formation for silica supported systems. (140, 141)

Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Selective Oxidation of Alkanes
It is possible to increase the yield of alkane dehydrogenation using molecular oxygen as coreactant to displace the thermodynamic equilibrium by oxidation of coproduct H2 into H2O. (131) However, despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx). The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive. (142-144) These types of catalysts can also be used to catalytically convert methane into oxygenates, e.g. formaldehyde, in the presence of O2 or N2O, albeit with a low yield (2−5%; high selectivity only obtained at low conversions): VOx, (145-147) MoOx, (148-150) WOx, (151) as well as FeOx. (152-154) While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. C−H bond activation. (155, 156) Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the C−H bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites: terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated vs polynuclear species (Scheme 8). (157-160) First, C−H bond activation on a terminal oxo species can take place via addition of the C−H bond across the M=O bond, [2 + 2]; two approaches are possible, leading to alkyl or hydride intermediates, respectively (Scheme 10a and b). Alternatively, C−H bond activation on the terminal oxo species can lead directly to the formation of the corresponding alcohol bound to the reduced metal center (oxenoïd insertion mechanism, Scheme 10c). C−H bond activation can occur via H-abstraction, generating an alkyl radical intermediate; on bis-oxo species, typically present on MoOx systems, syn and anti approaches are possible (Schemes 10d and e). H-abstraction can also occur on μ-O bridge species (Scheme 10f). Finally, C−H bond activation can also occur via [3 + 2]- or [5 + 2]-activation for sites with gem and vicinal bis-oxo species, respectively (Schemes 10g and h). These processes involve either nonredox two-electron processes (the heterolytic splitting of the C−H bond on acid−base centers), redox two-electron processes ([n + m]-processes), or a redox one-electron process generating radicals. DFT calculations on cluster models clearly show that the lowest energy barrier is usually associated with the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species (anti better than syn) with Cr (20.0 kcal mol−1) < V (35.5 kcal mol−1) < Mo (45.0 kcal mol−1) < W (56.8 kcal mol−1). (159) However, C−H bond activation leading to a metal−alkyl intermediate (Scheme 10b) can be competitive in some cases: W (43.6 kcal mol−1) < Mo (50.1 kcal mol−1) < V (57.0 kcal mol−1) < Cr (not found). So far, however, no metal−alkyl intermediate has been experimentally observed for these systems.
