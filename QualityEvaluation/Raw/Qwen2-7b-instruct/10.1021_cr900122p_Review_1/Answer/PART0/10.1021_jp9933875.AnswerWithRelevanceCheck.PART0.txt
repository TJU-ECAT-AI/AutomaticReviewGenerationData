          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."
          [2] "Propane combustion rates, however, are less affected by VOx surface density, which leads to a decrease in k2/k1 ratios as surface density increases."
          [3] "The k3/k1 ratio, which causes the yield losses observed as conversion increases, is large (540) on VOx-based catalysts."
          [4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
          [5] "Metal oxides having high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield."

          Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes faces challenges due to the limitation of alkene yields, often around 30% for propane and higher alkanes, due to the secondary combustion of primary alkene products. The surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) affects propane combustion rates less, leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, which causes yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. The difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases, with V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+. High redox properties of metal oxides correlate with high catalytic activity, while less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio, resulting in higher propene yield.

          烷烃转化为烯烃的氧化脱氢化（ODH）面临挑战，因为主要烷烃产品的二次燃烧限制了丙烷和更高烷烃的烯烃产率，通常约为30%。VOx表面密度影响丙烷燃烧速率较小，导致在表面密度增加时，丙烯燃烧与丙烷脱氢化（k2/k1）比率下降。导致随着转化率增加而观察到的产率损失的k3/k1比率在基于VOx的催化剂上非常高。随着阳离子酸性的增加，丙烷ODH与丙烯燃烧之间的激活能差增加，遵循V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+的序列。具有高还原性的金属氧化物与高催化活性相关联，而较不酸性的金属氧化物导致较小的ΔE1  ΔE3值和较小的k3/k1比率，从而获得更高的丙烯产率。

          [4] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
          [5] "The kinetics and reaction pathways for propane ODH on VOx-based catalysts have been described in detail previously. 31 The ODH rate is proportional to C3H8 partial pressures and independent of O2 partial pressures when H2O partial pressures are low; the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations."

Propane combustion rates are less affected by the surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx), leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, causing yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. The reactivity of propene is enhanced in part because the weakest C-H bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic C-H bond in propene. Propane ODH kinetics and reaction pathways on vanadium oxide (VOx)-based catalysts have been described in detail previously. The ODH rate is proportional to the partial pressure of propane (C3H8) and independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (O2) when the partial pressure of water (H2O) is low; the rates acquire a more complex dependence on propane and oxygen pressures when water is present at higher concentrations.

          烷烃转化为烯烃的氧化脱氢化（ODH）受主要烷烃产品的二次燃烧限制，使得丙烷和更高烷烃的烯烃产率通常约为30%。丙烷燃烧速率受VOx表面密度的影响较小，导致在表面密度增加时，丙烯燃烧与丙烷脱氢化（k2/k1）比率下降。导致随着转化率增加而观察到的产率损失的k3/k1比率在基于VOx的催化剂上非常高。丙烯的反应性增强部分原因是丙烷中较弱的C-H键（甲基键）比丙烯中的支链C-H键强得多。基于钒氧化物（VOx）的催化剂上的丙烷ODH动力学和反应途径已在之前的详细描述中给出。当水分压低时，丙烷ODH速率与丙烷（C3H8）分压成正比，且独立于氧气（O2）分压；当水存在较高浓度时，速率对丙烷和氧气的压力依赖关系变得更为复杂。
