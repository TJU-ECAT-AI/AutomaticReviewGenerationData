          [1] "With a C-H (first) bond energy of 104 kcaYmole and a weak interaction with most surfaces that is dominated by dispersion forces, methane seems to be the most diffi- cult molecule among all organic substances to activate."
          [2] "Nevertheless, when it is re-acted with water (steam reforming) over nickel catalysts it dehydrogenates com- pletely to produce CO and Hz by an endo- thermic process (I)."
          [3] "The purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility of partial oxidation of meth- ane under atmospheric pressure conditions."
          [4] "The methane-to-methanol conversion is a thermodynamically favorable process and in light of the successes obtained with the partial oxidation of other small molecules,ethylene and propylene, the production of methanol from methane deserves serious experimental scrutiny."
          [5] "The activation energy of 40 kcal/mole for meth- anol formation was found to be the same as for formaldehyde at temperatures above 540C."

          Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process faces challenges in activating C-H bonds, particularly methane, due to its high bond energy and weak surface interaction dominated by dispersion forces. Despite these challenges, methane can undergo complete dehydrogenation to produce CO and H2 when reacted with water over nickel catalysts. The study aims to investigate the feasibility of partial oxidation of methane under atmospheric pressure conditions. The conversion of methane to methanol is thermodynamically favorable, and its production is considered important alongside other small molecules' partial oxidation successes. The activation energy for forming methanol is found to be 40 kcal/mole at temperatures above 540°C.

          分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程时，激活C-H键面临挑战，特别是甲烷，由于其高键能和主要由范德华力主导的较弱表面相互作用。尽管存在这些挑战，但当甲烷与水在镍催化剂上反应时，仍可完全脱氢生成CO和H2。研究旨在探讨在大气压力条件下甲烷部分氧化的可能性。甲烷到甲醇的转化是热力学有利的，其生产被认为与乙烷和丙烷等其他小分子的部分氧化的成功一样重要。形成甲醇的激活能量在540°C以上时被发现为40 kcal/mole。
