          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes transforms alkanes into alkenes and hydrogen. Various catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, have been investigated for this conversion. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is difficult due to competing reactions and byproducts. Proposed mechanisms for ODH reactions involve C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation strategies can mitigate selectivity problems by decreasing the chance of unintended side reactions. The efficiency of ODH processes relies on factors like catalyst design, operational settings, and reaction kinetics.
