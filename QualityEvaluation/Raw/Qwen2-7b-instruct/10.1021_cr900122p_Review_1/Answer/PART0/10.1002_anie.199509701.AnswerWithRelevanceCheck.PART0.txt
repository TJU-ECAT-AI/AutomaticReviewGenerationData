          [1] "The extent of the CO, effect depends very much on the basicity of the catalyst."
          [2] "Similar increases in E, from 134 kJmol-' to 218 kJmol-' were found for methane conversion when CO, was added to the reagents during oxidative coupling."
          [3] "The role of CO, in improving C, selectivity from CH,, or C,H, selectivity from C,H,, is illustrated by the results in Table 3."
          [4] "The origin of this effect is not obvious, but the results suggest that CO, may poison sites that are uniquely capable of promoting the further oxidation of C,H, to CO,"
          [5] "One of the manifestations of this role of CO, is the effect of residence time on selectivity."
          [6] "The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH,"
          [7] "The effect of the simultaneous presence of CH, and 0, over the catalyst is illustrated by the results of Figure 5."
          [8] "The early discovery of Li/MgO as an effective oxidative coupling catalyst focused attention on [Li+O-] centers as possible sites for the activation of CH,"
          [9] "The [Li'O-] centers have also been observed in Li/ZnO catalysts, and the analogous [Na+O-] centers have been found in Na/CaO."
          [10] "Based upon high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and co- worker concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates function as the active centers on LiiMgO."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the interaction among various catalysts, encompassing bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion poses challenges due to the intricacies of reactions, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediate formation, and 2H abstraction. The catalyst's basicity plays a pivotal role, as evidenced by CO, enhancing selectivity when added to reagents during oxidative coupling. CO, may poison sites uniquely capable of further oxidizing C,H, to CO. The duration of residence in the catalyst bed affects selectivity, demonstrating CO's role in this aspect. The variety of catalysts indicates multiple types of active centers could contribute to CH activation, rather than a singular type. The simultaneous presence of CH and O over the catalyst is essential, impacting reaction efficiency. The early identification of Li/MgO as an effective catalyst highlights the significance of [Li+O-] centers in CH activation. Analogous centers have been observed in Li/ZnO and Na/CaO catalysts. Based on high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) analysis of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and colleagues concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates serve as the active centers on Li/MgO.

          烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程受到各种催化剂之间的相互作用影响，包括体金属氧化物和支撑系统。在实现高选择性和转化率时面临的挑战主要源于反应过程的复杂性，如C-H键的活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H的抽象。催化剂的碱性在这些过程中扮演关键角色，例如在氧化耦合反应中添加CO时，CO对反应的影响。CO可能会毒害那些特别能促进C-H进一步氧化成CO的独特位点。催化剂床中的停留时间影响选择性，体现了CO在选择性方面的作用。催化剂的多样性表明，可能有多种活性中心参与CH的激活，而不仅仅是单一类型。同时存在CH和O对催化剂的影响至关重要，它影响反应的效率。Li/MgO作为有效催化剂的早期发现强调了Li+O-中心在CH活化中的重要性。在Li/ZnO和Na/CaO催化剂中也观察到了类似中心。基于模型Li/MgO催化剂的高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）分析，Goodman及其同事得出结论，F中心（一个带有两个被捕获电子的氧化物离子空位）或F中心聚集体在Li/MgO上充当活性中心。
