Achieving significant quantities of methanol or formaldehyde has remained a challenge, even at very low conversion levels, with carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) typically dominating as the main products. The 0- ions, produced by the surface decomposition of nitrous oxide (N20), are hypothesized to function as the active catalyst species that initiates the catalytic process through a hydrogen abstraction reaction. The stoichiometric reaction of methane (CH4) with 0- was explored in a conventional gas-circulating system, employing a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at a pH of 2. Methanol was identified as the primary product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C. Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was found to be significantly less active compared to other catalysts. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO) at a conversion rate of 16% surpasses previous reports in the literature. Water is essential for maintaining the selectivities of CH3OH and H2CO, with an increase in water quantity leading to higher product yields without any observed reduction in catalyst activity.
