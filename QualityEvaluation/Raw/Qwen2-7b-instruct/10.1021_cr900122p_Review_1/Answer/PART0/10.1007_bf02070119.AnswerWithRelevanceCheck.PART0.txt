          Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the importance of catalyst properties, particularly the nature of active sites, in selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. It details the synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts through calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides, highlighting the preparation of samples with varying Cu/Th atomic ratios. The catalytic process involves oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure, with the conversion of alkanes to alkenes closely tied to the presence of copper in thoria. The study reveals that the selectivity for ethylene production increases with copper content up to a ratio of 0.25, after which it decreases. For propane, the conversion shows a direct correlation with copper concentration in ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is below 0.25, remaining constant for higher ratios. The selectivity for propene production increases sharply with copper content, reaching a peak at Cu/Th=0.1, before decreasing for higher atomic ratios.

          分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），文档讨论了催化剂性质，特别是活性位点的性质，在选择性氢化和脱氢反应中的重要性。它详细介绍了通过将铜和钍氢氧化物煅烧合成CuTh氧化物催化剂的过程，并强调了制备不同Cu/Th原子比样品的重要性。催化过程涉及在823 K下使用大气压力的动态流动微反应器对烷烃进行氧化脱氢作用，将烷烃转化为烯烃，这一过程与钍中的铜的存在密切相关。研究表明，乙烯的产率随铜含量增加至0.25的比例增加，之后减少。对于丙烷，其转化与ThO2中的铜浓度直接相关，当Cu/Th原子比小于0.25时，随着铜含量的增加保持稳定，对于更高的原子比则保持不变。丙烯的选择性随着铜含量的增加而迅速提高，达到峰值Cu/Th=0.1，然后对于更高的原子比开始下降。

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves interactions between various catalysts, particularly focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, which typically involve C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it affects how effectively the catalysts can activate alkyl groups while inhibiting unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by the balance between these factors. For instance, at lower copper-to-thorium ratios (Cu/Th < 0.1), higher conversions of propane and better selectivities for propene are observed. However, at higher copper contents, the selectivity in propene decreases due to the formation of CuO crystallites, which limit the conversion. The reaction mechanism suggests that the selectivity in propene can be attributed to Cu2+ ions localized in substitutional sites, rather than other sites, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process.

          烷烃氧化脱氢过程涉及各种催化剂之间的交互作用，特别是关注于单质金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于反应的复杂性，通常涉及C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体和2H摘除。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中扮演关键角色，因为它影响催化剂有效激活烷基团的能力，同时抑制不必要的副反应。该过程效率受到这些因素之间平衡的影响。例如，在较低铜/钍比（Cu/Th < 0.1）下，丙烷的更高转化率和更好的丙烯选择性被观察到。然而，在更高的铜含量下，丙烯的选择性降低，这是由于形成CuO晶粒，限制了转化。反应机制表明，丙烯的选择性可能归因于位于取代位点的Cu2+离子，而不是其他位点，这有助于整体过程效率。
