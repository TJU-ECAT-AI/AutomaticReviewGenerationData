          [1] "More detailed elucidations of structurereactivity relationships are important for the development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts."
          [2] "The environment of the iron sites can further be modified by the presence of acidic groups or alkali metal ions."
          [3] "In a previous paper, we showed that the FeIII in the framework of MCM-41 was more efficient than the FeOx clusters for the conversion of CH4 to HCHO by O2."
          [4] "The partial oxidation of CH4 and the epoxidation of C3H6 were carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor (quartz tube) operated at atmospheric pressure."
          [5] "It should be noted that only ca. 0.1 wt% Fe could be incorporated into SBA-15 by the direct synthesis irrespective of the amount of iron added in the synthesis mixture possibly because SBA-15 was prepared in a strong acid medium."

          The development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts relies heavily on a deeper understanding of the structural-reactivity relationships. The environment surrounding the iron sites can be further tailored by incorporating acidic groups or alkali metal ions, which impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity. A study previously demonstrated that iron(III) within the MCM-41 framework outperformed iron oxides in clusters for the conversion of methane to formic acid via oxygen. Partial oxidation of methane and the epoxidation of propene were executed under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow reactor using a quartz tube. It is noteworthy that the direct synthesis process for SBA-15 could only incorporate about 0.1 wt% iron, regardless of the iron amount added, likely due to the strong acid medium used during its preparation.

          对于高效铁基异质选择氧化催化剂的发展而言，深入理解结构-反应性关系至关重要。铁位点周围的环境可以通过引入酸性基团或碱金属离子进一步调整，这影响催化剂的活性和选择性。先前的一项研究表明，在MCM-41框架中的铁(III)相对于铁氧化物簇在通过氧气将甲烷转化为甲醛方面更有效。在常压下，使用石英管固定床流动反应器对甲烷进行部分氧化和丙烯醇氧化。值得注意的是，直接合成SBA-15时只能加载约0.1 wt%的铁，无论合成混合物中添加了多少铁，这可能是因为其制备过程中使用了强酸介质。
