          Recent studies have confirmed that nitrous oxide (N20) is an efficient oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. In efforts to elucidate the role of oxygen ions (O-) in the partial oxidation of methane, researchers examined both the stoichiometric reaction of methane with O- and the catalytic oxidation of methane with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica. At desorption temperatures above 300 °C, methanol emerged as the primary product. Under the tested conditions, silica gel exhibited markedly lower activity compared to other catalysts. The presence of water led to an increase in the production of methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO), without observing a decline in catalyst activity. It is plausible that CH30- ions are involved in the process, and when alkane molecules react with O- ions on magnesium oxide (MgO), zincoxide ions (ZnO2) are formed. There is also a possibility that at higher temperatures, hydroxyl radicals derived from water or siloxane (Si-OH) groups may react with CH3 radicals to form CH3OW.

          近期的研究已经证实，氮氧化物（N20）在使用支持在硅上的钼氧化物的条件下，是烷烃氧化脱氢的有效氧化剂。为了探讨氧气离子（O-）在甲烷部分氧化过程中的作用，研究人员研究了甲烷与O-的定量反应以及甲烷在硅上支持的钼氧化物的催化氧化与N20的反应。在脱附温度超过300 °C时，观察到主要产物为甲醇。在测试条件下，硅胶的活性远低于其他催化剂。水的存在导致了甲醇（CH3OH）和二氧化碳（H2CO）的产量增加，而催化剂活性并未降低。可以推测，CH30-离子可能参与到该过程中，当烷烃分子与MgO上的O-离子反应时，会形成锌氧化物（ZnO2）。此外，也有一个可能性是在较高温度下，来自水或硅氧烷（Si-OH）基团的羟基自由基可能会与CH3自由基反应形成CH3OW。

          [1] "Little success has been achieved in obtaining methanol or formaldehyde in substantial amounts and the main products are CO and CO, even at very low conversion levels."

          [4] "Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C."

          Achieving significant quantities of methanol or formaldehyde has proven challenging, with carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) typically emerging as the primary products even at very low conversion rates. The 0- ions, generated by the surface decomposition of nitrous oxide (N20), have been hypothesized as the active species that initiates the catalytic process through a hydrogen abstraction reaction. The stoichiometric reaction of methane (CH4) with 0- was investigated in a standard gas-circulating system, utilizing a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at a pH of 2. At desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C, methanol was observed as the main product. Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was found to be significantly less active compared to other catalysts. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO) at a conversion rate of 16% outperforms reported results in the literature. Water is essential for maintaining the selectivities of CH3OH and H2CO; as the amount of water increases, so do the quantities of these products, without any observed reduction in catalyst activity.

          在极低的转化率下，获得大量甲醇或甲醛仍然具有挑战性，通常碳一氧化碳（CO）和二氧化碳（CO2）成为主要产物。由硝酸盐表面分解产生的0-离子被假设为通过氢原子转移反应启动催化过程的活性物种。在标准气体循环系统中，通过将氨七钼酸铵浸渍到硅胶中，pH值为2来研究甲烷（CH4）与0-的定量反应。在脱附温度超过300 °C时，观察到主要产物为甲醇。在实验条件下，硅胶的活性远低于其他催化剂。在16%转化率下的甲醇（CH3OH）和二氧化碳（H2CO）的组合选择性达到了60%，这优于文献报道的结果。水对于维持CH3OH和H2CO的选择性至关重要；随着水的量增加，这些产品的数量也随之增加，而催化剂活性并未降低。

At desorption temperatures greater than 300 °C, methanol was identified as the primary product. Under the experimental conditions, silica gel exhibited substantially lower activity compared to other catalysts. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO) at a conversion rate of 16% surpasses reported findings in the literature. Water is indispensable for maintaining the selectivities of CH3OH and H2CO, with an increase in water quantity correlating to higher product yields without any decrease in catalyst performance.
