          [1] "These results parallel those of gas-phase studies involving 0- and al- kanes."
          [2] "Although these reactions were carried out in a stoichiometric rather than a catalytic manner, we may expect that 0- is an important intermediate in the partial oxidation of alkanes."
          [3] "The partial oxidation of methane into more reactive chemicals such as methanol, ethylene, and other aliphatics is a current problem of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [4] "High molecular stability, however, makes it difficult to convert CH4 into other useful chemicals."
          [5] "Using molybdenum supported on silica, Lipatkina et al. also investigated the stoichiometric reaction of 0- with CH4 and confirmed the formation of CH3. radicals."
          [6] "Recent results from our laboratory have demonstrated that alkyl radicals, formed by the reaction between surface 0- ions and alkanes over Mo/SiO2 catalyst, are part of a catalytic cycle."

          Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process involves understanding the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the intricate nature of the reactions, which involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by multiple factors, including the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, which helps in directing the reaction towards desired products rather than undesired ones. High molecular stability can make it difficult to convert methane (CH4) into other useful chemicals. Recent studies have shown that alkyl radicals, formed by the reaction between surface 0- ions and alkanes over a molybdenum/silica catalyst, are part of a catalytic cycle. Understanding these mechanisms can aid in optimizing the process for better yield and selectivity.

          分析烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程涉及理解各种催化剂（包括体金属氧化物和支持体系）之间复杂的相互作用。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战通常源于反应的复杂性，包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成以及2H抽取。这些过程的效率受多种因素的影响，包括催化剂对活性位点的隔离能力，这有助于将反应导向所需产品而不是副产品。较高的分子稳定性可能使将甲烷（CH4）转化为其他有用化学品变得困难。最近的研究表明，通过在钼/二氧化硅催化剂上反应表面0-离子和烷烃而形成的烷基自由基，是催化循环的一部分。了解这些机制有助于优化过程以获得更好的产率和选择性。

          [5] "In the present paper we report on the selective conversion of methane to ethylene and ethane at relatively high conversions, using O2 as the oxidant."
          [6] "Ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good selectivities when CH4 and O2 are passed over Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures."
          [7] "These C2 compounds are formed via the coupling of the gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced mainly by the reaction of CH4 with active [Li'O-] centers on MgO."
          [8] "The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst which does not contain metal ions having a variable oxidation state."

In this context, the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as an oxidation catalyst offers a unique platform for achieving high selectivity and conversion in the ODH process. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced by the reaction of methane with active [Li'O-] centers on magnesium oxide, leads to the formation of C2 compounds such as ethane and ethylene. This system demonstrates the potential for achieving high yields and selectivities in ODH, especially when optimized for temperature and reactant pressures.
