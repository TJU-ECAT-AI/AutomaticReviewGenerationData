          [8] "Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a)."
          [9] "These types of catalysts can also be used to catalytically convert methane into oxygenates, e.g. formaldehyde, in the presence of O2 or N2O, albeit with a low yield (25%; high selectivity only obtained at low conversions): VOx, (145-147) MoOx, (148-150) WOx, (151) as well as FeOx."
          [10] "While Malkyl intermediates might be formed at lower temperatures, (120) the key step of this reaction is a H-abstraction, the formation of radical intermediates, and subsequent gas phase reactions."

"[6] Although unsupported V-P-O has the greatest selectivity for maleic anhydride at a P : V ratio of approximately unity, the selectivity for maleic anhydride for the supported catalysts increased from 23 to 48% with a corresponding increase in the P : V ratio from 0.6 to about 2.8."
