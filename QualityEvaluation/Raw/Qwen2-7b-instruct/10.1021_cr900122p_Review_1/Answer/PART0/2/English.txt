In all these processes, propene, whether the reactant or generated in situ, is converted via a CH bond activation involving a H-abstraction to generate a stabilized propenyl radical. The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation. The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species. Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has emerged that the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment. These types of catalysts can also be used to catalytically convert methane into oxygenates, albeit with a low yield and high selectivity only obtained at low conversions.

The selectivity for maleic anhydride production in supported catalysts significantly increased with an increase in the phosphorus-to-vanadium ratio. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed the formation of VOPO4 and its hydrate, VOPO4.2H2O, indicating the involvement of these compounds in the enhanced selectivity for maleic anhydride production.

This process offers a general, simple, and efficient method for converting simple arenes directly to potentially useful compounds in one step under mild conditions. Many of the products obtained, such as coumarins, 2(1H)-quinolines, and cis-aryl-a,p-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, are biologically relevant compounds and cannot be easily accessed by other known reactions. The process is applicable in organic and medical chemistry and can be utilized by chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves understanding the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, which involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by multiple factors, including the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, which helps in directing the reaction towards desired products rather than undesired ones. In this context, the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as an oxidation catalyst offers a unique platform for achieving high selectivity and conversion in the ODH process. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced by the reaction of methane with active [Li'O-] centers on magnesium oxide, leads to the formation of C2 compounds such as ethane and ethylene. This system demonstrates the potential for achieving high yields and selectivities in ODH, especially when optimized for temperature and reactant pressures.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves interactions between various catalysts, particularly focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, which typically involve C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it affects how effectively the catalysts can activate alkyl groups while inhibiting unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by the balance between these factors. For instance, at lower copper-to-thorium ratios (Cu/Th < 0.1), higher conversions of propane and better selectivities for propene are observed. However, at higher copper contents, the selectivity in propene decreases due to the formation of CuO crystallites, which limit the conversion. The reaction mechanism suggests that the selectivity in propene can be attributed to Cu2+ ions localized in substitutional sites, rather than other sites, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process.

Achieving significant quantities of methanol or formaldehyde has proven challenging, with carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) typically emerging as the primary products even at very low conversion rates. The 0- ions, generated by the surface decomposition of nitrous oxide (N20), have been hypothesized as the active species that initiates the catalytic process through a hydrogen abstraction reaction. The stoichiometric reaction of methane (CH4) with 0- was investigated in a standard gas-circulating system, utilizing a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at a pH of 2. At desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C, methanol was observed as the main product. Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was found to be significantly less active compared to other catalysts. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO) at a conversion rate of 16% outperforms reported results in the literature. Water is essential for maintaining the selectivities of CH3OH and H2CO; as the amount of water increases, so do the quantities of these products, without any observed reduction in catalyst activity.

In the context of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, the development of effective catalysts is essential for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Metal molybdates, particularly those based on nickel and cobalt, have shown promise due to their ability to activate propane at relatively low temperatures. The choice of metal and the surface area of the catalyst significantly affect propane conversion and the yield of propylene. The addition of redox elements like vanadium, iron, cerium, and chromium can enhance the activity of NiCo molybdates, with chromium showing particular promise in retaining high selectivity at higher conversion rates, which may lead to the possibility of operating at lower process temperatures.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes transforms alkanes into alkenes and hydrogen. Various catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, have been investigated for this conversion. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is difficult due to competing reactions and byproducts. Proposed mechanisms for ODH reactions involve C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation strategies can mitigate selectivity problems by decreasing the chance of unintended side reactions. The efficiency of ODH processes relies on factors like catalyst design, operational settings, and reaction kinetics.

The high selectivity and activity of vanadium silicalite for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have been demonstrated through various experimental conditions. The selectivities and activities for propene formation, when extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, are 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C, respectively. These results indicate that vanadium silicalite is an effective catalyst for ODH, capable of efficiently converting propane into propene with high selectivity.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding how catalysts, both in bulk metal oxides and supported systems, interact with the reactants to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process often stem from difficulties in selectively activating the C-H bonds and generating desired alkyl intermediates, which can lead to byproduct formation and reduced efficiency. The proposed reaction mechanisms typically involve steps such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The role of catalyst site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by providing a localized environment for specific reactions to occur, thereby minimizing unwanted side reactions.

          The relevance of these factors to process efficiency lies in their ability to optimize the catalytic cycle for maximum product yield and purity. By carefully controlling the catalyst composition, support structure, and operating conditions, one can tailor the reaction pathways to favor the desired products. Site isolation techniques, such as incorporating Lewis acid sites or using bifunctional catalysts, can enhance selectivity by guiding the reaction flow towards the target product formation.

          The DFT calculations suggest that oxygen can activate surface chloride species by adsorbing dissociatively and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1. This process involves the oxidation of a surface chlorine without altering the underlying metal's oxidation state, differing significantly from conventional oxidative chlorination mechanisms. The proposed catalytic cycle highlights the importance of surface chemistry in driving the ODH reaction, offering insights into developing more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is hindered by the secondary combustion of primary alkene products, limiting alkene yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes. Propane combustion rates are less affected by the surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx), leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, causing yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. The reactivity of propene is enhanced in part because the weakest C-H bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic C-H bond in propene. Propane ODH kinetics and reaction pathways on vanadium oxide (VOx)-based catalysts have been described in detail previously. The ODH rate is proportional to the partial pressure of propane (C3H8) and independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (O2) when the partial pressure of water (H2O) is low; the rates acquire a more complex dependence on propane and oxygen pressures when water is present at higher concentrations.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are significant due to the competing pathways and the intricate mechanisms involved in the process. Key factors that collectively influence the process efficiency include the nature of the catalyst, its surface chemistry, the type of oxygen source, and the conditions under which the reaction is conducted. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By carefully selecting and modifying the catalyst composition, researchers aim to enhance the selectivity towards desired products. This involves understanding the specific reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which govern the pathway of the reaction. By optimizing these factors, the efficiency of the process can be improved, leading to more selective and productive catalysts for the ODH of alkanes.

          The role of supported chromium oxide catalysts in ODH is pivotal, as they are key in the production of essential commodity chemicals. These catalysts' activity and performance are closely tied to their molecular structure and interactions within the reaction environment. The study of supported chromium oxide catalysts in ODH reactions, particularly through in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopy, aids in understanding the role of different chromium species (Cr6, Cr3, and Cr2) in the catalytic process.

          As the Cr content and support composition increase, the catalytic activity of the supported chromium oxide catalysts also increases, reaching a peak after 515 minutes of operation. It is observed that the Cr3 species, formed upon the reduction of Cr6, are more active than the Cr2 species in the ODH process. The initial reduction of Cr6 leads to the formation of cracking products and CO/CO2, contributing to the conversion of alkanes.

          Collectively, these factors—catalyst type, Cr content, support composition, and the activity of chromium species—significantly impact the process efficiency of ODH. Addressing selectivity issues through site isolation strategies can optimize the conversion and yield of desired products, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the ODH process.

The review discusses the significant advancements in alkane functionalization, focusing on catalytic processes involving both organometallic and bioinorganic catalysts.

Addressing selectivity issues through site isolation strategies can optimize the conversion and yield of desired products, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the ODH process.

The review discusses the significant advancements in alkane functionalization, focusing on catalytic processes involving both organometallic and bioinorganic catalysts. It acknowledges ongoing challenges, especially the pursuit of a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization technique. This remains elusive, and understanding the underlying mechanisms presents particular difficulties.

In all these processes, propene, whether the reactant or generated in situ, is converted via a CH bond activation involving a H-abstraction to generate a stabilized propenyl radical. The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation. The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species. Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has emerged that the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment. These types of catalysts can also be used to catalytically convert methane into oxygenates, albeit with a low yield and high selectivity only obtained at low conversions.

The selectivity for maleic anhydride production in supported catalysts significantly increased with an increase in the phosphorus-to-vanadium ratio. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed the formation of VOPO4 and its hydrate, VOPO4.2H2O, indicating the involvement of these compounds in the enhanced selectivity for maleic anhydride production.

This process offers a general, simple, and efficient method for converting simple arenes directly to potentially useful compounds in one step under mild conditions. Many of the products obtained, such as coumarins, 2(1H)-quinolines, and cis-aryl-a,p-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, are biologically relevant compounds and cannot be easily accessed by other known reactions. The process is applicable in organic and medical chemistry and can be utilized by chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves understanding the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, which involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by multiple factors, including the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, which helps in directing the reaction towards desired products rather than undesired ones. In this context, the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as an oxidation catalyst offers a unique platform for achieving high selectivity and conversion in the ODH process. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced by the reaction of methane with active [Li'O-] centers on magnesium oxide, leads to the formation of C2 compounds such as ethane and ethylene. This system demonstrates the potential for achieving high yields and selectivities in ODH, especially when optimized for temperature and reactant pressures.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves interactions between various catalysts, particularly focusing on bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, which typically involve C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it affects how effectively the catalysts can activate alkyl groups while inhibiting unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by the balance between these factors. For instance, at lower copper-to-thorium ratios (Cu/Th < 0.1), higher conversions of propane and better selectivities for propene are observed. However, at higher copper contents, the selectivity in propene decreases due to the formation of CuO crystallites, which limit the conversion. The reaction mechanism suggests that the selectivity in propene can be attributed to Cu2+ ions localized in substitutional sites, rather than other sites, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process.

Achieving significant quantities of methanol or formaldehyde has proven challenging, with carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) typically emerging as the primary products even at very low conversion rates. The 0- ions, generated by the surface decomposition of nitrous oxide (N20), have been hypothesized as the active species that initiates the catalytic process through a hydrogen abstraction reaction. The stoichiometric reaction of methane (CH4) with 0- was investigated in a standard gas-circulating system, utilizing a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at a pH of 2. At desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C, methanol was observed as the main product. Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was found to be significantly less active compared to other catalysts. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO) at a conversion rate of 16% outperforms reported results in the literature. Water is essential for maintaining the selectivities of CH3OH and H2CO; as the amount of water increases, so do the quantities of these products, without any observed reduction in catalyst activity.

In the context of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, the development of effective catalysts is essential for achieving high selectivity and conversion. Metal molybdates, particularly those based on nickel and cobalt, have shown promise due to their ability to activate propane at relatively low temperatures. The choice of metal and the surface area of the catalyst significantly affect propane conversion and the yield of propylene. The addition of redox elements like vanadium, iron, cerium, and chromium can enhance the activity of NiCo molybdates, with chromium showing particular promise in retaining high selectivity at higher conversion rates, which may lead to the possibility of operating at lower process temperatures.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes transforms alkanes into alkenes and hydrogen. Various catalysts, such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems, have been investigated for this conversion. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is difficult due to competing reactions and byproducts. Proposed mechanisms for ODH reactions involve C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation strategies can mitigate selectivity problems by decreasing the chance of unintended side reactions. The efficiency of ODH processes relies on factors like catalyst design, operational settings, and reaction kinetics.

The high selectivity and activity of vanadium silicalite for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have been demonstrated through various experimental conditions. The selectivities and activities for propene formation, when extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, are 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C, respectively. These results indicate that vanadium silicalite is an effective catalyst for ODH, capable of efficiently converting propane into propene with high selectivity.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding how catalysts, both in bulk metal oxides and supported systems, interact with the reactants to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process often stem from difficulties in selectively activating the C-H bonds and generating desired alkyl intermediates, which can lead to byproduct formation and reduced efficiency. The proposed reaction mechanisms typically involve steps such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The role of catalyst site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by providing a localized environment for specific reactions to occur, thereby minimizing unwanted side reactions.

          The relevance of these factors to process efficiency lies in their ability to optimize the catalytic cycle for maximum product yield and purity. By carefully controlling the catalyst composition, support structure, and operating conditions, one can tailor the reaction pathways to favor the desired products. Site isolation techniques, such as incorporating Lewis acid sites or using bifunctional catalysts, can enhance selectivity by guiding the reaction flow towards the target product formation.

          The DFT calculations suggest that oxygen can activate surface chloride species by adsorbing dissociatively and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1. This process involves the oxidation of a surface chlorine without altering the underlying metal's oxidation state, differing significantly from conventional oxidative chlorination mechanisms. The proposed catalytic cycle highlights the importance of surface chemistry in driving the ODH reaction, offering insights into developing more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is hindered by the secondary combustion of primary alkene products, limiting alkene yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes. Propane combustion rates are less affected by the surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx), leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, causing yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. The reactivity of propene is enhanced in part because the weakest C-H bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic C-H bond in propene. Propane ODH kinetics and reaction pathways on vanadium oxide (VOx)-based catalysts have been described in detail previously. The ODH rate is proportional to the partial pressure of propane (C3H8) and independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (O2) when the partial pressure of water (H2O) is low; the rates acquire a more complex dependence on propane and oxygen pressures when water is present at higher concentrations.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we observe a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are significant due to the competing pathways and the intricate mechanisms involved in the process. Key factors that collectively influence the process efficiency include the nature of the catalyst, its surface chemistry, the type of oxygen source, and the conditions under which the reaction is conducted. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By carefully selecting and modifying the catalyst composition, researchers aim to enhance the selectivity towards desired products. This involves understanding the specific reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which govern the pathway of the reaction. By optimizing these factors, the efficiency of the process can be improved, leading to more selective and productive catalysts for the ODH of alkanes.

          The role of supported chromium oxide catalysts in ODH is pivotal, as they are key in the production of essential commodity chemicals. These catalysts' activity and performance are closely tied to their molecular structure and interactions within the reaction environment. The study of supported chromium oxide catalysts in ODH reactions, particularly through in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopy, aids in understanding the role of different chromium species (Cr6, Cr3, and Cr2) in the catalytic process.

          As the Cr content and support composition increase, the catalytic activity of the supported chromium oxide catalysts also increases, reaching a peak after 515 minutes of operation. It is observed that the Cr3 species, formed upon the reduction of Cr6, are more active than the Cr2 species in the ODH process. The initial reduction of Cr6 leads to the formation of cracking products and CO/CO2, contributing to the conversion of alkanes.
