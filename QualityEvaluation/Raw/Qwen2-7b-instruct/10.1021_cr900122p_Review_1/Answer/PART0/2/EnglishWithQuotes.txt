Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues, as it affects how effectively the catalysts can activate alkyl groups while inhibiting unwanted side reactions. The efficiency of the process is significantly influenced by the balance between these factors. For instance, at lower copper-to-thorium ratios (Cu/Th < 0.1), higher conversions of propane and better selectivities for propene are observed. However, at higher copper contents, the selectivity in propene decreases due to the formation of CuO crystallites, which limit the conversion. The reaction mechanism suggests that the selectivity in propene can be attributed to Cu2+ ions localized in substitutional sites, rather than other sites, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process.", "Doi": "10.1007/bf02070119"},
