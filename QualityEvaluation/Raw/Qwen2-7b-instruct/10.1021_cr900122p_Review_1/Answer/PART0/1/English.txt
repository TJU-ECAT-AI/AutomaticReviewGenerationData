Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it's evident that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in enhancing process efficiency. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are intertwined with the nature of the catalysts and their ability to facilitate specific reaction pathways. Key factors influencing process efficiency include the identification of active sites, the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues, and the understanding of common reaction intermediates across different reactions.

          Catalysts such as VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx, when supported on oxide materials, exhibit promising activity in both ODH and selective oxidation of alkanes into oxygenates. These systems often feature isolated sites or small clusters at low surface coverage, facilitating the activation of the C-H bond, which is the rate-determining step in these reactions. The activation process can involve a variety of mechanisms, including H-abstraction, the formation of alkyl or hydride intermediates, and the insertion of the CH bond across metal-oxygen bonds.

          DFT calculations indicate that the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species is energetically favorable, with chromium being the most efficient among the metals considered. This process contributes to the formation of alkyl radicals, which can further participate in subsequent reactions, such as gas-phase reactions or the formation of alkene products. The selectivity and yield of these reactions are influenced by the distance between active sites, suggesting the importance of site isolation to prevent unwanted side reactions and enhance product purity.

          In summary, the effectiveness of ODH processes is contingent upon the precise manipulation of catalyst properties, including the nature of active sites, the selectivity of C-H bond activation, and the control of reaction pathways to achieve high conversion and selectivity while minimizing overoxidation products.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems.

Site isolation plays a key role in addressing selectivity issues.

The ODH process involves the use of various catalysts, including Pd(II) species, and exclusion of Pd(I)-vinyli-dine and Pd(I)-allenyl complexes. It also mentions the possibility of alkene carbocations in the addition of alk-oxyarenes to activated alkenes. The process provides an efficient, straightforward, and versatile method for converting simple arenes into valuable compounds in one step under mild conditions, with potential applications in organic and medical chemistry, and use by chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process involves understanding the complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the intricate nature of the reactions, which involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by multiple factors, including the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, which helps in directing the reaction towards desired products rather than undesired ones. High molecular stability can make it difficult to convert methane (CH4) into other useful chemicals. Recent studies have shown that alkyl radicals, formed by the reaction between surface 0- ions and alkanes over a molybdenum/silica catalyst, are part of a catalytic cycle. Understanding these mechanisms can aid in optimizing the process for better yield and selectivity.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the importance of catalyst properties, particularly the nature of active sites, in selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. It details the synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts through calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides, highlighting the preparation of samples with varying Cu/Th atomic ratios. The catalytic process involves oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure, with the conversion of alkanes to alkenes closely tied to the presence of copper in thoria. The study reveals that the selectivity for ethylene production increases with copper content up to a ratio of 0.25, after which it decreases. For propane, the conversion shows a direct correlation with copper concentration in ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is below 0.25, remaining constant for higher ratios. The selectivity for propene production increases sharply with copper content, reaching a peak at Cu/Th=0.1, before decreasing for higher atomic ratios.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the interaction among various catalysts, encompassing bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion poses challenges due to the intricacies of reactions, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediate formation, and 2H abstraction. The catalyst's basicity plays a pivotal role, as evidenced by CO, enhancing selectivity when added to reagents during oxidative coupling. CO, may poison sites uniquely capable of further oxidizing C,H, to CO. The duration of residence in the catalyst bed affects selectivity, demonstrating CO's role in this aspect. The variety of catalysts indicates multiple types of active centers could contribute to CH activation, rather than a singular type. The simultaneous presence of CH and O over the catalyst is essential, impacting reaction efficiency. The early identification of Li/MgO as an effective catalyst highlights the significance of [Li+O-] centers in CH activation. Analogous centers have been observed in Li/ZnO and Na/CaO catalysts. Based on high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) analysis of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and colleagues concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates serve as the active centers on Li/MgO.

Recent studies have confirmed that nitrous oxide (N20) is an efficient oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. In efforts to elucidate the role of oxygen ions (O-) in the partial oxidation of methane, researchers examined both the stoichiometric reaction of methane with O- and the catalytic oxidation of methane with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica. At desorption temperatures above 300 °C, methanol emerged as the primary product. Under the tested conditions, silica gel exhibited markedly lower activity compared to other catalysts. The presence of water led to an increase in the production of methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO), without observing a decline in catalyst activity. It is plausible that CH30- ions are involved in the process, and when alkane molecules react with O- ions on magnesium oxide (MgO), zincoxide ions (ZnO2) are formed. There is also a possibility that at higher temperatures, hydroxyl radicals derived from water or siloxane (Si-OH) groups may react with CH3 radicals to form CH3OW.

          Different catalysts like MgO and lithium-doped MgO show varying activities due to their unique properties. Oxygen ions at low coordination sites facilitate hydrogen abstraction and radical formation. Lithium doping introduces substitutional lithium ions, creating active sites for efficient reactions. Temperature and oxygen treatment affect catalyst activity and selectivity.

          Overall, the interplay between catalysts, reaction conditions, and proposed mechanisms determines process efficiency. Site isolation through specific catalyst preparation improves selectivity and conversion rates.

Challenges in this field often involve understanding complex reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation being key to addressing selectivity issues. Metal molybdates, especially those based on nickel and cobalt, show promise as alternatives to vanadium-based catalysts for activating light paraffins. They demonstrate high activity at relatively low temperatures, making them suitable for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor, potentially with a second component consisting of well-known olefin-converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdates.

The development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts relies heavily on a deeper understanding of the structural-reactivity relationships. The environment surrounding the iron sites can be further tailored by incorporating acidic groups or alkali metal ions, which impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity. A study previously demonstrated that iron(III) within the MCM-41 framework outperformed iron oxides in clusters for the conversion of methane to formic acid via oxygen. Partial oxidation of methane and the epoxidation of propene were executed under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow reactor using a quartz tube. It is noteworthy that the direct synthesis process for SBA-15 could only incorporate about 0.1 wt% iron, regardless of the iron amount added, likely due to the strong acid medium used during its preparation.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a demanding process due to the high activation barriers for C-H bond cleavage. Catalysts play a pivotal role, especially in achieving high selectivity and conversion. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are extensively studied, each with unique pros and cons. Factors like catalyst loading, support material, and reaction conditions greatly affect ODH efficiency. Proposed mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediate formation, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is crucial for addressing selectivity issues by limiting reaction pathways. High selectivity and conversion demand meticulous optimization of catalyst and reaction parameters.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), this study demonstrates the effectiveness of vanadium silicalite catalysts. The vanadium silicalite material, known for its efficiency in propane ODH, was used as a benchmark. The catalysts were evaluated under specific conditions including a catalyst dosage of 0.025 g, 0.500 g of quartz chips as support, ambient pressure, and an O2/C3H8/He feed ratio of 8:25:200. The flow rate ranged from 30 to 233 mL/min. 

          The results showed high propene selectivities of 86.6%, 82.1%, and 73.2% at reaction temperatures of 400, 450, and 500°C, respectively. The corresponding propene production rates were 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1, 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1, and 19 mmol g-1 h-1, respectively. These findings highlight the capability of the catalysts in achieving high conversion and selectivity, essential for efficient ODH processes. The high propene selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, indicates a well-controlled reaction mechanism and effective activation of C-H bonds leading to propene formation without substantial secondary combustion.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process faces challenges in activating C-H bonds, particularly methane, due to its high bond energy and weak surface interaction dominated by dispersion forces. Despite these challenges, methane can undergo complete dehydrogenation to produce CO and H2 when reacted with water over nickel catalysts. The study aims to investigate the feasibility of partial oxidation of methane under atmospheric pressure conditions. The conversion of methane to methanol is thermodynamically favorable, and its production is considered important alongside other small molecules' partial oxidation successes. The activation energy for forming methanol is found to be 40 kcal/mole at temperatures above 540°C.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding how catalysts, both in bulk metal oxides and supported systems, interact with the reactants to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Challenges in this process often stem from difficulties in selectively activating the C-H bonds and generating desired alkyl intermediates, which can lead to byproduct formation and reduced efficiency. The proposed reaction mechanisms typically involve steps such as C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The role of catalyst site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by providing a localized environment for specific reactions to occur, thereby minimizing unwanted side reactions.

          The relevance of these factors to process efficiency lies in their ability to optimize the catalytic cycle for maximum product yield and purity. By carefully controlling the catalyst composition, support structure, and operating conditions, one can tailor the reaction pathways to favor the desired products. Site isolation techniques, such as incorporating Lewis acid sites or using bifunctional catalysts, can enhance selectivity by guiding the reaction flow towards the target product formation.

          The DFT calculations suggest that oxygen can activate surface chloride species by adsorbing dissociatively and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1. This process involves the oxidation of a surface chlorine without altering the underlying metal's oxidation state, differing significantly from conventional oxidative chlorination mechanisms. The proposed catalytic cycle highlights the importance of surface chemistry in driving the ODH reaction, offering insights into developing more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes faces challenges due to the limitation of alkene yields, often around 30% for propane and higher alkanes, due to the secondary combustion of primary alkene products. The surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) affects propane combustion rates less, leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, which causes yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. The difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases, with V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+. High redox properties of metal oxides correlate with high catalytic activity, while less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio, resulting in higher propene yield.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we find that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complexity of the reactions involved, which often include difficulties in controlling the consecutive oxidation of alkanes to carbon oxides. Site isolation, which refers to the separation of active sites on the catalyst surface, plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, it becomes possible to tailor the reaction pathways and enhance the yield of desired products. Factors influencing process efficiency include the nature of the catalyst, reaction conditions, and the interplay between the catalyst and reactants.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors like the type of catalyst, its loading, and the support material. For instance, the dehydrogenation activity of supported chromium oxide catalysts increases with increasing chromium content and support content, reaching a maximum after a certain period of operation. This highlights the importance of optimizing these parameters to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The initial reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) is critical in initiating the dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the formation of cracking products and selectively producing alkenes. The direct correlation between the amount of chromium(III) formed upon reduction of chromium(VI) and catalytic activity suggests that chromium(III) is the active species involved in the dehydrogenation process.

The document discusses the ongoing challenges in the field of alkane functionalization with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, particularly focusing on achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization. It acknowledges that despite significant advancements, the ability to perform such functionalization remains elusive.

This highlights the importance of optimizing these parameters to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The initial reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) is critical in initiating the dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the formation of cracking products and selectively producing alkenes. The direct correlation between the amount of chromium(III) formed upon reduction of chromium(VI) and catalytic activity suggests that chromium(III) is the active species involved in the dehydrogenation process.

Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are intertwined with the nature of the catalysts and their ability to facilitate specific reaction pathways. Key factors influencing process efficiency include the identification of active sites, the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues, and the understanding of common reaction intermediates across different reactions.

          Catalysts such as VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx, when supported on oxide materials, exhibit promising activity in both ODH and selective oxidation of alkanes into oxygenates. These systems often feature isolated sites or small clusters at low surface coverage, facilitating the activation of the C-H bond, which is the rate-determining step in these reactions. The activation process can involve a variety of mechanisms, including H-abstraction, the formation of alkyl or hydride intermediates, and the insertion of the CH bond across metal-oxygen bonds.

          DFT calculations indicate that the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species is energetically favorable, with chromium being the most efficient among the metals considered. This process contributes to the formation of alkyl radicals, which can further participate in subsequent reactions, such as gas-phase reactions or the formation of alkene products. The selectivity and yield of these reactions are influenced by the distance between active sites, suggesting the importance of site isolation to prevent unwanted side reactions and enhance product purity.

          In summary, the effectiveness of ODH processes is contingent upon the precise manipulation of catalyst properties, including the nature of active sites, the selectivity of C-H bond activation, and the control of reaction pathways to achieve high conversion and selectivity while minimizing overoxidation products.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the importance of catalyst properties, particularly the nature of active sites, in selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. It details the synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts through calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides, highlighting the preparation of samples with varying Cu/Th atomic ratios. The catalytic process involves oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure, with the conversion of alkanes to alkenes closely tied to the presence of copper in thoria. The study reveals that the selectivity for ethylene production increases with copper content up to a ratio of 0.25, after which it decreases. For propane, the conversion shows a direct correlation with copper concentration in ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is below 0.25, remaining constant for higher ratios. The selectivity for propene production increases sharply with copper content, reaching a peak at Cu/Th=0.1, before decreasing for higher atomic ratios.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the interaction among various catalysts, encompassing bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion poses challenges due to the intricacies of reactions, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediate formation, and 2H abstraction. The catalyst's basicity plays a pivotal role, as evidenced by CO, enhancing selectivity when added to reagents during oxidative coupling. CO, may poison sites uniquely capable of further oxidizing C,H, to CO. The duration of residence in the catalyst bed affects selectivity, demonstrating CO's role in this aspect. The variety of catalysts indicates multiple types of active centers could contribute to CH activation, rather than a singular type. The simultaneous presence of CH and O over the catalyst is essential, impacting reaction efficiency. The early identification of Li/MgO as an effective catalyst highlights the significance of [Li+O-] centers in CH activation. Analogous centers have been observed in Li/ZnO and Na/CaO catalysts. Based on high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) analysis of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and colleagues concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates serve as the active centers on Li/MgO.

Recent studies have confirmed that nitrous oxide (N20) is an efficient oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. In efforts to elucidate the role of oxygen ions (O-) in the partial oxidation of methane, researchers examined both the stoichiometric reaction of methane with O- and the catalytic oxidation of methane with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica. At desorption temperatures above 300 °C, methanol emerged as the primary product. Under the tested conditions, silica gel exhibited markedly lower activity compared to other catalysts. The presence of water led to an increase in the production of methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO), without observing a decline in catalyst activity. It is plausible that CH30- ions are involved in the process, and when alkane molecules react with O- ions on magnesium oxide (MgO), zincoxide ions (ZnO2) are formed. There is also a possibility that at higher temperatures, hydroxyl radicals derived from water or siloxane (Si-OH) groups may react with CH3 radicals to form CH3OW.

Metal molybdates, especially those based on nickel and cobalt, show promise as alternatives to vanadium-based catalysts for activating light paraffins. They demonstrate high activity at relatively low temperatures, making them suitable for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor, potentially with a second component consisting of well-known olefin-converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdates.

The development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts relies heavily on a deeper understanding of the structural-reactivity relationships. The environment surrounding the iron sites can be further tailored by incorporating acidic groups or alkali metal ions, which impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity. A study previously demonstrated that iron(III) within the MCM-41 framework outperformed iron oxides in clusters for the conversion of methane to formic acid via oxygen. Partial oxidation of methane and the epoxidation of propene were executed under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow reactor using a quartz tube. It is noteworthy that the direct synthesis process for SBA-15 could only incorporate about 0.1 wt% iron, regardless of the iron amount added, likely due to the strong acid medium used during its preparation.

Proposed mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, metal-alkyl intermediate formation, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation is crucial for addressing selectivity issues by limiting reaction pathways. High selectivity and conversion demand meticulous optimization of catalyst and reaction parameters.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), this study demonstrates the effectiveness of vanadium silicalite catalysts. The vanadium silicalite material, known for its efficiency in propane ODH, was used as a benchmark. The catalysts were evaluated under specific conditions including a catalyst dosage of 0.025 g, 0.500 g of quartz chips as support, ambient pressure, and an O2/C3H8/He feed ratio of 8:25:200.

The corresponding propene production rates were 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1, 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1, and 19 mmol g-1 h-1, respectively. These findings highlight the capability of the catalysts in achieving high conversion and selectivity, essential for efficient ODH processes. The high propene selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, indicates a well-controlled reaction mechanism and effective activation of C-H bonds leading to propene formation without substantial secondary combustion.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process faces challenges in activating C-H bonds, particularly methane, due to its high bond energy and weak surface interaction dominated by dispersion forces.

The study aims to investigate the feasibility of partial oxidation of methane under atmospheric pressure conditions. The conversion of methane to methanol is thermodynamically favorable, and its production is considered important alongside other small molecules' partial oxidation successes. The activation energy for forming methanol is found to be 40 kcal/mole at temperatures above 540°C.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding how catalysts, both in bulk metal oxides and supported systems, interact with the reactants to achieve high selectivity and conversion.

          The DFT calculations suggest that oxygen can activate surface chloride species by adsorbing dissociatively and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1. This process involves the oxidation of a surface chlorine without altering the underlying metal's oxidation state, differing significantly from conventional oxidative chlorination mechanisms. The proposed catalytic cycle highlights the importance of surface chemistry in driving the ODH reaction, offering insights into developing more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes faces challenges due to the limitation of alkene yields, often around 30% for propane and higher alkanes, due to the secondary combustion of primary alkene products. The surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) affects propane combustion rates less, leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, which causes yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. The difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases, with V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+. High redox properties of metal oxides correlate with high catalytic activity, while less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio, resulting in higher propene yield.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), we find that various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in the process. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion arise due to the complexity of the reactions involved, which often include difficulties in controlling the consecutive oxidation of alkanes to carbon oxides. Site isolation, which refers to the separation of active sites on the catalyst surface, plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, it becomes possible to tailor the reaction pathways and enhance the yield of desired products. Factors influencing process efficiency include the nature of the catalyst, reaction conditions, and the interplay between the catalyst and reactants. The proposed reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, collectively contribute to the overall efficiency of the process. These mechanisms involve the activation of alkane molecules through the breaking of C-H bonds, the formation of alkyl species, and the subsequent reaction of these species with surface oxygen to form alkenes. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues lies in its ability to control the reaction pathways and optimize the conversion of alkanes to alkenes, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems.

          Catalysts such as VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx, when supported on oxide materials, exhibit promising activity in both ODH and selective oxidation of alkanes into oxygenates. These systems often feature isolated sites or small clusters at low surface coverage, facilitating the activation of the C-H bond, which is the rate-determining step in these reactions. The activation process can involve a variety of mechanisms, including H-abstraction, the formation of alkyl or hydride intermediates, and the insertion of the CH bond across metal-oxygen bonds.

          DFT calculations indicate that the H-abstraction process on terminal oxo species is energetically favorable, with chromium being the most efficient among the metals considered. This process contributes to the formation of alkyl radicals, which can further participate in subsequent reactions, such as gas-phase reactions or the formation of alkene products. The selectivity and yield of these reactions are influenced by the distance between active sites, suggesting the importance of site isolation to prevent unwanted side reactions and enhance product purity.

          In summary, the effectiveness of ODH processes is contingent upon the precise manipulation of catalyst properties, including the nature of active sites, the selectivity of C-H bond activation, and the control of reaction pathways to achieve high conversion and selectivity while minimizing overoxidation products.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the document discusses the importance of catalyst properties, particularly the nature of active sites, in selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. It details the synthesis of CuTh oxide catalysts through calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides, highlighting the preparation of samples with varying Cu/Th atomic ratios. The catalytic process involves oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure, with the conversion of alkanes to alkenes closely tied to the presence of copper in thoria. The study reveals that the selectivity for ethylene production increases with copper content up to a ratio of 0.25, after which it decreases. For propane, the conversion shows a direct correlation with copper concentration in ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is below 0.25, remaining constant for higher ratios. The selectivity for propene production increases sharply with copper content, reaching a peak at Cu/Th=0.1, before decreasing for higher atomic ratios.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the interaction among various catalysts, encompassing bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Achieving high selectivity and conversion poses challenges due to the intricacies of reactions, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediate formation, and 2H abstraction. The catalyst's basicity plays a pivotal role, as evidenced by CO, enhancing selectivity when added to reagents during oxidative coupling. CO, may poison sites uniquely capable of further oxidizing C,H, to CO. The duration of residence in the catalyst bed affects selectivity, demonstrating CO's role in this aspect. The variety of catalysts indicates multiple types of active centers could contribute to CH activation, rather than a singular type. The simultaneous presence of CH and O over the catalyst is essential, impacting reaction efficiency. The early identification of Li/MgO as an effective catalyst highlights the significance of [Li+O-] centers in CH activation. Analogous centers have been observed in Li/ZnO and Na/CaO catalysts. Based on high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) analysis of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and colleagues concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates serve as the active centers on Li/MgO.

Recent studies have confirmed that nitrous oxide (N20) is an efficient oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. In efforts to elucidate the role of oxygen ions (O-) in the partial oxidation of methane, researchers examined both the stoichiometric reaction of methane with O- and the catalytic oxidation of methane with N20 over molybdenum oxide supported on silica. At desorption temperatures above 300 °C, methanol emerged as the primary product. Under the tested conditions, silica gel exhibited markedly lower activity compared to other catalysts. The presence of water led to an increase in the production of methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO), without observing a decline in catalyst activity. It is plausible that CH30- ions are involved in the process, and when alkane molecules react with O- ions on magnesium oxide (MgO), zincoxide ions (ZnO2) are formed. There is also a possibility that at higher temperatures, hydroxyl radicals derived from water or siloxane (Si-OH) groups may react with CH3 radicals to form CH3OW.

Metal molybdates, especially those based on nickel and cobalt, show promise as alternatives to vanadium-based catalysts for activating light paraffins. They demonstrate high activity at relatively low temperatures, making them suitable for direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile in a single reactor, potentially with a second component consisting of well-known olefin-converting, multicomponent mixed metal molybdates.

The development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts relies heavily on a deeper understanding of the structural-reactivity relationships. The environment surrounding the iron sites can be further tailored by incorporating acidic groups or alkali metal ions, which impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity. A study previously demonstrated that iron(III) within the MCM-41 framework outperformed iron oxides in clusters for the conversion of methane to formic acid via oxygen. Partial oxidation of methane and the epoxidation of propene were executed under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow reactor using a quartz tube. It is noteworthy that the direct synthesis process for SBA-15 could only incorporate about 0.1 wt% iron, regardless of the iron amount added, likely due to the strong acid medium used during its preparation.

The corresponding propene production rates were 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1, 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1, and 19 mmol g-1 h-1, respectively. These findings highlight the capability of the catalysts in achieving high conversion and selectivity, essential for efficient ODH processes. The high propene selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, indicates a well-controlled reaction mechanism and effective activation of C-H bonds leading to propene formation without substantial secondary combustion.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the process faces challenges in activating C-H bonds, particularly methane, due to its high bond energy and weak surface interaction dominated by dispersion forces.

The study aims to investigate the feasibility of partial oxidation of methane under atmospheric pressure conditions. The conversion of methane to methanol is thermodynamically favorable, and its production is considered important alongside other small molecules' partial oxidation successes. The activation energy for forming methanol is found to be 40 kcal/mole at temperatures above 540°C.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding how catalysts, both in bulk metal oxides and supported systems, interact with the reactants to achieve high selectivity and conversion.

          The relevance of these factors to process efficiency lies in their ability to optimize the catalytic cycle for maximum product yield and purity. By carefully controlling the catalyst composition, support structure, and operating conditions, one can tailor the reaction pathways to favor the desired products. Site isolation techniques, such as incorporating Lewis acid sites or using bifunctional catalysts, can enhance selectivity by guiding the reaction flow towards the target product formation.

          The DFT calculations suggest that oxygen can activate surface chloride species by adsorbing dissociatively and forming OCl- species, with the formal oxidation state of Cl changing from 1 to +1. This process involves the oxidation of a surface chlorine without altering the underlying metal's oxidation state, differing significantly from conventional oxidative chlorination mechanisms. The proposed catalytic cycle highlights the importance of surface chemistry in driving the ODH reaction, offering insights into developing more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes faces challenges due to the limitation of alkene yields, often around 30% for propane and higher alkanes, due to the secondary combustion of primary alkene products. The surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) affects propane combustion rates less, leading to a decrease in the ratio of propene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k2/k1) as surface density increases. The k3/k1 ratio, which causes yield losses as conversion increases, is notably high on VOx-based catalysts. The difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases, with V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+.
