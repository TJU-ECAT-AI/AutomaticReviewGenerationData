          "[1] Several groups in recent years have attempted to support V-P-O catalysts on silica [4-6], alumina [7,8], titania [4,7,9] or AIPO4 [10]."
          "[2] Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."
          "[3] We report here a study of phosphorus-modified silica-supported vanadia in which the samples were characterized with Raman spectroscopy to understand the changes in the selectivities for maleic anhydride in the oxidation of butane."
          "[4] Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly."
          "[5] At low conversions, PV0.0 produced primarily a mixture of 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene but very little maleic anhydride [12]."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include interactions between catalysts and alkane molecules, complex reaction pathways, and site isolation effects. Phosphorus modification enhances selectivity in the production of maleic anhydride, especially in the partial oxidation of butane, where the catalyst shows improved selectivity for maleic anhydride even at low conversions. The study employs Raman spectroscopy to analyze changes in selectivity and the formation of VOPO4 compounds.

          烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化的挑战包括催化剂与烷烃分子之间的相互作用、复杂的反应途径以及位点隔离效应。磷化处理提高了马来酸酐的生产选择性，特别是在正丁烷的部分氧化中，即使在低转化率下，催化剂也显示出对马来酸酐的改善选择性。研究使用拉曼光谱分析了选择性的变化和VOPO4化合物的形成。

          "[6] Although unsupported V-P-O has the greatest selectivity for maleic anhydride at a P : V ratio of approximately unity, the selectivity for maleic anhydride for the supported catalysts increased from 23 to 48% with a corresponding increase in the P : V ratio from 0.6 to about 2.8."
          "[7] Changes in the samples could be observed with Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of the samples."
          "[8] Treatment of 2.8 wt% V/SiO2 with triethylphosphate resulted in the formation of VOPO4, which was hydrated to VOPO4.2H20 upon exposure to moisture."

          The selectivity for maleic anhydride production in supported catalysts significantly increased with an increase in the phosphorus-to-vanadium ratio. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed the formation of VOPO4 and its hydrate, VOPO4.2H2O, indicating the involvement of these compounds in the enhanced selectivity for maleic anhydride production.

          "[9] From these results, one would expect that if the samples were prepared in a reducing atmosphere, fine crystallites of supported (VO)2P207 could be produced with catalytic properties similar to the unsupported samples."

      <English>
          If the samples were prepared under a reducing atmosphere, it is expected that fine crystallites of supported (VO)2P207 could be produced, which would exhibit similar catalytic properties to the unsupported samples. This suggests that controlling the preparation conditions could potentially improve the catalyst's performance.

          如果样品是在还原气氛下制备的，预计可以生产出具有与未支撑样品相似催化性质的细晶粒支持的(VO)2P207。这表明控制制备条件可能能够提高催化剂的性能。
