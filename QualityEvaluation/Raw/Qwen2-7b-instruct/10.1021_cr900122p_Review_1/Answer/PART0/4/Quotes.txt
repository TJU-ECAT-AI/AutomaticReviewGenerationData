          [2] "These results parallel those of gas-phase studies involving O- and alkanes."
          [3] "Using molybdenum supported on silica, Lipatkina et al. also investigated the stoichiometric reaction of O- with CH4 and confirmed the formation of CH3. radicals."
          [4] "Recent results from our laboratory have demonstrated that alkyl radicals, formed by the reaction between surface O- ions and alkanes over Mo/SiO2 catalyst, are part of a catalytic cycle."

          [6] "Ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good selectivities when CH4 and O2 are passed over Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures."
          [7] "These C2 compounds are formed via the coupling of the gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced mainly by the reaction of CH4 with active [Li'O-] centers on MgO."
          [8] "The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst which does not contain metal ions having a variable oxidation state."

[1] "Little success has been achieved in obtaining methanol or formaldehyde in substantial amounts and the main products are CO and CO, even at very low conversion levels."
          [2] "The 0- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N20, have been postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction."
          [3] "The stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with 0- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at pH = 2."
          [4] "Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 째C."
          [5] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active."
          [6] "The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."
