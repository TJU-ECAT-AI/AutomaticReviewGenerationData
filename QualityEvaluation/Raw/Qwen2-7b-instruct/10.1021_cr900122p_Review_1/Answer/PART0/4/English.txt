Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves understanding the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the complex nature of the reactions, which involve C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by multiple factors, including the catalyst's ability to isolate active sites, which helps in directing the reaction towards desired products rather than undesired ones. In this context, the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as an oxidation catalyst offers a unique platform for achieving high selectivity and conversion in the ODH process. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced by the reaction of methane with active [Li'O-] centers on magnesium oxide, leads to the formation of C2 compounds such as ethane and ethylene. This system demonstrates the potential for achieving high yields and selectivities in ODH, especially when optimized for temperature and reactant pressures.

Obtaining significant quantities of methanol or formaldehyde has remained elusive, even at very low conversion rates, with carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) predominating as the main products. The 0- ions, produced by the surface decomposition of nitrous oxide (N20), are believed to act as the active catalyst species that initiates the catalytic process through a hydrogen abstraction reaction. The stoichiometric reaction of methane (CH4) with 0- was investigated in a standard gas-circulating system, with the catalyst being prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta-molybdate at a pH of 2. At desorption temperatures greater than 300 °C, methanol was identified as the primary product. Under the experimental conditions, silica gel exhibited substantially lower activity compared to other catalysts. The combined selectivity of 60% for methanol (CH3OH) and carbon dioxide (H2CO) at a conversion rate of 16% surpasses reported findings in the literature. Water is indispensable for maintaining the selectivities of CH3OH and H2CO, with an increase in water quantity correlating to higher product yields without any decrease in catalyst performance.
