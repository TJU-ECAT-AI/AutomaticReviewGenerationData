Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves examining the role of catalysts such as bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion often arise due to the difficulty in controlling the reaction pathways and preventing unwanted side reactions. The proposed reaction mechanisms, including C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, collectively contribute to process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the active sites and minimizing the formation of non-target products. The Hg(II)-sulfuric acid system exemplifies the development of catalytic systems capable of selective, low-temperature oxidation of methane, offering a promising avenue for improving ODH processes.
