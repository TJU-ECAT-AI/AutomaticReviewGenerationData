[1] "The net transformation of the established steps is the selective oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen."
[2] "Understanding the molecular basis for such a system would be valuable to the continuing search for even more efficient methane oxidation catalysts."
[3] "Three key steps in the catalytic sequence have been established."
[4] "The working model based on the available data is shown in Scheme 2."
[5] "Our observations do not imply that Hg(OSO3H)2 is the species that activates methane."
[6] "At this time, the identity of this species is unknown."

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
