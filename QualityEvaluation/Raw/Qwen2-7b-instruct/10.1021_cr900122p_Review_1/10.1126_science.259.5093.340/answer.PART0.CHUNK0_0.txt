The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the conversion of hydrocarbon molecules into shorter-chain hydrocarbons or functionalized compounds through the breaking of C-H bonds. Challenges in ODH include achieving high selectivity and conversion, as well as the development of efficient catalysts. The use of bulk metal oxides and supported systems can offer different levels of activity and selectivity depending on their composition and structure. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining the reaction to specific sites on the catalyst surface, thereby preventing unwanted side reactions. Catalysts such as mercury (Hg(II)) and thallium (Tl(III)) can be used for selective oxidation of methane due to their ability to mediate electrophilic reactions through intermediate alkyl metal species. The high yield and mild conditions of the Hg(II)-sulfuric acid system suggest that it is well-suited for studying the mechanism of alkane oxidation, including the activation of C-H bonds and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates. The reoxidation step, where mercurous bisulfate is converted back to mercuric bisulfate, indicates the efficiency of the sulfuric acid as an oxidant in this system.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及将碳氢化合物分子转化为较短链的碳氢化合物或功能化化合物，通过断裂C-H键。ODH面临的挑战包括实现高选择性和转化率，以及高效催化剂的开发。使用大块金属氧化物和支持系统可以提供不同的活性和选择性，具体取决于它们的组成和结构。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过将反应限制在催化剂表面的特定位点，从而防止不必要的副反应。汞（Hg(II)）、铊（Tl(III)）等催化剂可用于选择性氧化甲烷，因为它们能够通过中间烷基金属物种介导电负性反应。Hg(II)-硫酸系统的高产率和温和条件表明，它非常适合研究烷烃氧化的机制，包括C-H键的活化和M-烷基中间体的形成。再氧化步骤，其中将二价汞硫酸盐还原为一价汞硫酸盐，表明硫酸作为这种系统中的氧化剂的效率。
