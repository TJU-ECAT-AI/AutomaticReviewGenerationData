1. Quantum chemical cluster models of Cr(III)silica sites have been employed to investigate the oxidative addition of ethane, a process involving the activation of C-H bonds.

2. Ethane fails to form a molecular complex with chromium on DeRossi-type Cr(III) sites, indicating a reactive rather than physi-sorptive interaction.

3. The computational analysis for the gen-2bridge model reveals that the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of CH activation are 162 and 283 kJ mol1, respectively.

4. The dehydrogenation cycle necessitates an immediate secondary reaction step after the initial CH activation.

5. The stereochemical rearrangement is identified as the reaction step with the highest energy barriers among the elementary reactions.

6. The initial step of oxidative addition of ethane has a computed activation energy of 160 kJ mol1.

7. On sites where chromium is connected to the silica surface via two oxygen bridges, hydrogen transfer predominantly occurs through a stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex.

8. The regeneration of the reactant two-bridge (DeRossi) site from chromium(V)cyclopropane involves the desorption of ethene.

9. Oxidative addition appears to be an improbable pathway for catalytic dehydrogenation in Cr(III)silica catalysts.

1. 研究人员使用量子化学簇模型研究了Cr(III)二氧化硅位点上的乙烷氧化脱氢作用，涉及C-H键的活化。

2. 乙烷在DeRossi型Cr(III)位点上未能形成分子复合物，显示了反应性的而非物理吸附的相互作用。

3. 对gen-2桥模型的计算分析表明，CH活化过程的焓和吉布斯自由能分别为162和283 kJ/mol。

4. 完成脱氢循环需要立即进行第二个反应步骤，即在初始CH活化之后。

5. 比较所有基本反应步骤，立体化学重排被确定为具有最高能量壁垒的步骤。

6. 考虑到初始步骤，即乙烷的氧化添加，其计算得到的活化能为160 kJ/mol。

7. 在铬通过两个氧桥连接到二氧化硅表面的位点上，氢转移主要通过ethylyydridochromium(V)复杂体的立体化学重排进行。

8. 从铬(V)环戊烷中再生反应物两个桥接（DeRossi）位点涉及乙烯的脱附。

9. 考虑到Cr(III)二氧化硅催化剂，氧化添加似乎不是催化脱氢作用的可能途径。
