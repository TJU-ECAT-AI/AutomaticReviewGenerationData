[1] "The importance of the choice of oxide carrier for the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction is the subject of a forthcoming publication [25]."
[2] "Significantly lower activation energy was found for an alternative mechanism in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium surface species."
[3] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges, the preferred mode of -hydrogen transfer is via a stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand with release of H2."
[4] "The kinetic bottleneck of this reaction mechanism is given by the first step, which is associated with CH activation but more precisely with the transition state of the rearrangement step. The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are high, ca 220 and 350 kJ mol1, respectively, and close to the activation energies previously computed for a different mechanism of CH activation,namely -bond metathesis, on specific three-bridge chromium sites.23 Both of these seem inferior to a third mechanism of dehydrogenation, which involves CH activation by -bond metathesis on a hydridochromium(III) species. The computed activation energy of the latter mechanism is <100 kJ mol1,23 and the two-bridge models investigated here may act as precursors to this more active species."

1. The selection of oxide carrier plays a crucial role in the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction, a topic that will be covered in a future publication.
2. An alternative mechanism with notably lower activation energy involves CH activation occurring at a reactive hydridochromium surface species.
3. On sites with chromium linked to the silica surface via two oxygen bridges, the favored hydrogen transfer process is a stereorearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand and release of H2.
4. The initial step of the reaction mechanism, specifically the transition state of the rearrangement process, acts as the kinetic bottleneck. With a high computed enthalpy and free energy of activation, approximately 220 and 350 kJ/mol respectively, this mechanism is less favorable compared to other methods. The two-bridge models examined here could potentially lead to more active species that utilize -bond metathesis for CH activation.

1. 氧化物载体的选择对于催化脱氢反应至关重要，这一主题将在后续出版物中探讨。
2. 另一种机制具有显著较低的活化能，其中在活性氢化铬表面物种上进行CH活化。
3. 在通过两个氧桥与硅酸盐表面相连的铬离子上，氢转移过程优选的是乙基氢化铬(V)复合物的立体重排，随后氢转移到氢化基团并释放H2。
4. 反应机制的初始步骤，特别是重排过程的过渡状态，充当了动力学瓶颈。计算得到的热力学能和自由能活化分别约为220和350 kJ/mol，这使得此机制相对于其他方法不那么有利。这里研究的两种桥模型可能可以发展为更活跃的物种，这些物种使用-键异构化进行CH活化。
