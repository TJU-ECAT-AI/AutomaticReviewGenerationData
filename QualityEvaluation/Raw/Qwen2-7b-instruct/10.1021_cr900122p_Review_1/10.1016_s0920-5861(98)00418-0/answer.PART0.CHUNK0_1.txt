2.1.1. Multicomponent complex mixed metal molybdates Over the past 20 years several generations of multi-component molybdates have been developed, and the compositions are becoming ever more sophisticated and complex, giving ever better yields of the desired acrylonitrile product. The last three catalyst generations, summarized according to their empirical formulae, are presented in Table 1.

Analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves understanding the interaction between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are numerous, including difficulties in C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the 2H-abstraction process. The efficiency of the process is influenced by these factors, particularly in terms of catalyst selectivity and activity. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by ensuring that the active sites for dehydrogenation and other reactions are physically separated, preventing unwanted side reactions and enhancing the overall yield of the desired product.
