[1] "These processes are not only important from a commercial standpoint and their contribution to the well-being of modern mankind, but they also present the opportunity for significant fundamental research."
[2] "Over the past 20 years several generations of multi-component molybdates have been developed, and the compositions are becoming ever more sophisticated and complex, giving ever better yields of the desired acrylonitrile product."
[3] "For example, it is by now well known that the primarily function of bismuth [1,2] in these compositions is its ability to activate the surface adsorbed propylene through the abstraction of an a-hydrogen."
[4] "The function of molybdenum is to chemisorb propylene and activate the ammonia molecule by generating chemisorbed NH-species which are capable of inserting into the chemisorbed allylic intermediate, creating the acrylonitrile precursors."
[5] "The necessity of having two functionally distinct phases to attain high acrylonitrile yield efficiency is illustrated in Fig. 3 [8]."
[6] "It is obvious that the Fe3 containing Bi-molybdate active phase, as well as the Fe2 containing M2-molybdate regeneration phase, must be present at the same time to attain high acrylonitrile product yields."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion stem from the need to efficiently activate C-H bonds, generate M-alkyl intermediates, and perform 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence process efficiency by affecting the rate of reaction, energy consumption, and product purity. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by confining reactive species to specific regions of the catalyst, thus enhancing the formation of desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions. Future advancements aim to optimize catalyst composition, enhance selectivity, and improve the environmental profile of ODH processes.
