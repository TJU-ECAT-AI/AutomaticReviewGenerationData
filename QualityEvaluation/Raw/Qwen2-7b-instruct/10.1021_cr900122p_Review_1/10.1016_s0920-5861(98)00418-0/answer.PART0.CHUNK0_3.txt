[1] "Over the past 20 years several generations of multi-component molybdates have been developed, and the compositions are becoming ever more sophisticated and complex, giving ever better yields of the desired acrylonitrile product."
[2] "The necessity of having two functionally distinct phases to attain high acrylonitrile yield efciency is illustrated in Fig. 3 [8]."
[3] "There is also ample latitude left in optimizing the texture of these complex ammoxidation catalysts."
[4] "Surely there are other approaches to be pursued to achieve higher desired product yields and environ- mentally more optimal product mixes."
