2.1.1. Multicomponent complex mixed metal molybdates Over the past 20 years several generations of multi-component molybdates have been developed, and the compositions are becoming ever more sophisticated and complex, giving ever better yields of the desired acrylonitrile product. The last three catalyst generations, summarized according to their empirical formulae, are presented in Table 1.
For example, it is by now well known that the primarily function of bismuth [1,2] in these compositions is its ability to activate the surface adsorbed propylene through the abstraction of an a-hydrogen. The function of molybdenum is to chemisorb propylene and activate the ammonia molecule by generating chemisorbed NH-species which are capable of inserting into the chemisorbed allylic intermediate, creating the acrylonitrile precursors. The function of iron is to serve as an efficient redox couple (Fe3/2), capable of efficient lattice oxygen transfer to the BiOMo active site in its 3 oxidation state. In its 2 state it is capable of efficient dioxygen chemisorption, its reducible transformation to lattice oxygen (O2) and hence its incorporation into the lattice. Since it is very difficult to maintain a sufficient number of Fe2 surface sites in an overall oxidizing gaseous atmosphere, it is necessary to stabilize the Fe2 state structurally. To this end divalent elements such as Ni, Co, Mg and Mn form stable isostructural molybdates with Fe2 molybdates, and by virtue of solid solutions stabilize the Fe2 state. Thus Ni, Co, Mg and Mn have the function of providing the host structure for Fe2 in these multifunctional, multiphase catalysts.
In a similar manner, Fe3 is stabilized through its limited solubility in the a-bismuth molybdate phase, the latter phase providing the host structure for Fe3.
The Cr3/2 is a redox couple of its own, generally, effective at a temperature higher than that of the iron couple. But it also acts as a structural diluent to iron and booster of the Fe3 state in the Bi-molybdate matrix.
The role of the alkali is to annihilate the most acidic cracking sites of the compositions, to serve as a spacer and contact enhancer of the two functionally distinct but epitaxially matched catalyst phases. The two phases are composed of the Fe3 containing catalytically active a-bismuth molybdate phase and the Fe2 containing (Ni, Co, Mg, Mn) molybdate phase. These two phases must cooperate with each other, and therefore, they must be in utmost proximity of each other; they would be ineffective if remotely separated from each other. For this reason it is of interest that the most effective multiphase oxidation catalysts have at least one face which is for all practical purposes epitaxially essentially matched (principle of phase cooperation [7]).
A schematic representation of such a phase cooperation between two functionally distinct phases of typical multicomponent multiphase catalysts enumerated above is shown in Fig. 2.
The necessity of having two functionally distinct phases to attain high acrylonitrile yield efficiency is illustrated in Fig. 3 [8]. It is obvious that the Fe3 containing Bi-molybdate active phase, as well as the Fe2 containing M2-molybdate regeneration phase, must be present at the same time to attain high acrylonitrile product yields.

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), it's clear that the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The challenges in this process often stem from the need to balance the activation of C-H bonds, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H to proceed towards the desired product. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve these steps, which collectively influence process efficiency. The role of site isolation becomes essential in addressing selectivity issues, ensuring that the desired reactions occur while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This strategic arrangement allows for a more controlled and selective pathway towards the production of high-quality products.
