1. The study highlights the significance of understanding structure-reactivity relationships for the development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts. The catalysts' performance varies depending on the structure and environment of the active iron sites within the material. These sites can be modified by adding acidic groups or alkali metal ions, influencing their catalytic behavior in selective oxidation reactions.

2. The FeIII in the framework of MCM-41 demonstrated higher efficiency in converting CH4 to HCHO compared to FeOx clusters. This finding underscores the importance of the iron site's location and structure in determining its activity.

3. The environment surrounding the iron sites can be altered by incorporating acidic or alkali metal ions, potentially enhancing the catalyst's performance. This manipulation is crucial for achieving high selectivity and conversion rates.

4. The research team has been focusing on elucidating the connections between the structures and environments of iron sites introduced into mesoporous silica and their catalytic properties in selective oxidation processes.

5. In the direct synthesis method, an iron source (FeCl3) is mixed with silica source (SiCl4) and a template (Pluronic P123 triblock copolymer) to create the catalyst material. This technique allows for the incorporation of iron into the material.

6. The direct synthesis process for SBA-15 resulted in the incorporation of only approximately 0.1 wt% of iron, regardless of the iron amount added during synthesis. This might be due to the strong acid medium used in the preparation of SBA-15.

1. 研究强调了理解铁基异质选择氧化催化剂结构-反应性关系的重要性，对于开发高效催化剂至关重要。活性铁位点的结构和环境对催化剂性能有显著影响。通过添加酸性基团或碱金属离子，可以改变这些环境，从而影响它们在选择性氧化反应中的催化行为。

2. MCM-41框架中的FeIII相较于FeOx簇，在将CH4转化为HCHO方面显示出更高的效率。这一发现表明，铁位点的位置和结构对于其活性具有重要意义。

3. 铁位点周围的环境可以通过引入酸性或碱金属离子进行调整，可能提高催化剂的性能。这种调整对于实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。

4. 研究团队一直致力于阐明引入到介孔硅酸盐中的铁位点结构与它们在选择性氧化过程中的催化性质之间的联系。

5. 在直接合成方法中，通过将铁源（FeCl3）与硅源（SiCl4）和模板（Pluronic P123三嵌段共聚物）混合来制造催化剂材料。这种方法允许将铁纳入材料中。

6. 直接合成SBA-15的过程仅导致了大约0.1 wt%的铁被吸收，无论在合成过程中添加了多少铁。这可能是由于SBA-15的强酸介质制备方式所致。
