[1] "We have been working on the elucidation of the relationships between the structures and environments of the active iron sites introduced into mesoporous silica and their catalytic behaviors in selective oxidation reactions."
[2] "In the present paper, we present some of our recent research results on the partial oxidation of CH4 to useful oxygenates and the epoxidation of propylene, which are two highly desirable but very difficult reactions."
[3] "We recently found that, as compared with MCM-41, SBA-15 was a better support for the loadings of MoOx [19], VOx [20,21] and FePO4 [23] for the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2 due to its larger pore diameter and more inert property without any acid sites."
[4] "The comparative studies using N2O and O2 as the oxidant revealed that N2O was necessary for PO formation over the KCl-FeOx/SBA-15 catalyst."
[5] "Most of the existing researches seem to suggest that a high dispersion of iron species is necessary for the selective oxidation reactions since iron oxides such as a-Fe2O3 tend to catalyze the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons to CO and CO2."

Analyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the literature highlights the importance of catalysts' structure and composition in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems show distinct performances in ODH processes. For instance, the direct synthesis of iron-containing mesoporous materials, like SBA-15, allows for a more efficient incorporation of iron species compared to other methods, potentially enhancing catalytic activity. The use of iron sites isolated within the framework of materials, rather than as oligomeric clusters, leads to improved selectivity and activity in the partial oxidation of methane by oxygen.

The role of site isolation is pivotal in addressing selectivity issues. By modifying iron-containing catalysts with acidic groups or alkali metal ions, one can change the dispersion or coordination environment of iron species, thus improving their catalytic performance. For example, the introduction of phosphate into the catalyst enhances the formation of HCHO during the oxidation of methane. Similarly, the epoxidation of propylene benefits from the addition of alkali metal salts like potassium chloride, indicating the effectiveness of these additives in modifying the catalyst's properties.

These findings collectively influence process efficiency by optimizing the balance between selectivity and conversion. The use of well-designed catalysts with optimized iron site environments ensures a more efficient ODH process, leading to higher yields of desired products while minimizing unwanted byproducts.

The interplay between various catalysts, their structures, and the modifications applied to them plays a crucial role in overcoming the challenges associated with high selectivity and conversion in ODH. Site isolation techniques, alongside the strategic addition of chemical modifiers, enable the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the process.

分析烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的过程，文献强调了催化剂结构和组成在实现高选择性和转化率方面的重要性。块状金属氧化物和支持系统在ODH过程中表现出不同的性能。例如，通过直接合成方法制备的铁基介孔材料，如SBA-15，允许更有效地将铁物种集成到材料中，可能增强催化活性。与孤立在框架内的铁位点相比，使用作为寡聚簇的铁物种在甲烷的氧气化过程中表现出改进的选择性和活性。

隔离位点在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。通过向铁基催化剂中添加酸性基团或碱金属离子，可以改变铁物种的分散度或局部协调环境，从而改善其催化性能。例如，在催化剂中引入磷酸可增强甲烷氧化生成甲醛。同样，丙烯的环氧化从添加钾氯化物中受益，这表明这些添加剂在修改催化剂性质方面的有效性。

这些发现共同影响过程效率，通过优化选择性和转化率之间的平衡。通过设计良好的催化剂和优化的铁位点环境确保ODH过程的更高产率，同时减少不需要的副产品。

各种催化剂、它们的结构以及所应用的修改之间的相互作用在克服高选择性和转化率的挑战中起着关键作用。隔离技术，结合有针对性的化学修饰，使开发更高效和选择性的催化剂成为可能，从而提高整个过程的效率。
