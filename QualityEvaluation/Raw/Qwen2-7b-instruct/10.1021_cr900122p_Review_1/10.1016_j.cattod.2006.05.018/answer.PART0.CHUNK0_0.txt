The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the conversion of hydrocarbon molecules into shorter chain molecules through the breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Catalysts play a crucial role in this process, particularly in achieving high selectivity and conversion rates. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are often utilized in ODH processes. Challenges in ODH include maintaining high selectivity while increasing conversion efficiency, especially in the presence of competing reactions. Site isolation is a strategy to address selectivity issues by confining reactive species to specific locations within the catalyst, thereby enhancing the desired reaction pathway.

The structure-reactivity relationship is pivotal for developing efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts. The environment around the iron sites can be modified by incorporating acidic groups or alkali metal ions, which affects their activity and selectivity. For instance, iron species in the framework of MCM-41 are more efficient than those in FeOx clusters for the conversion of CH4 to HCHO by O2. This highlights the importance of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues.

The partial oxidation of CH4 and the epoxidation of C3H6 are carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. This setup allows for controlled conditions suitable for these reactions, enabling the separation of products through gas chromatography.

In the synthesis of iron-containing SBA-15 materials, only approximately 0.1 wt% of iron could be incorporated regardless of the added iron amount due to the strong acid medium used during the preparation of SBA-15. This limitation influences the loading of iron species and potentially affects the catalyst's performance in ODH reactions.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及通过断裂碳-氢键将烃分子转化为较短链分子的过程。催化剂在这一过程中起着关键作用，特别是在提高选择性和转化率的同时克服挑战。块状金属氧化物和支持系统常用于ODH过程。ODH的主要挑战包括在存在竞争反应的情况下维持高选择性并增加转化效率。位点隔离是通过将活性物种限制在催化剂内的特定位置来解决选择性问题的一种策略，从而增强所需的反应途径。

结构-反应关系对于开发高效的铁基异构选择氧化催化剂至关重要。铁周围环境的修改可以通过引入酸性基团或碱金属离子来实现，这影响它们的活性和选择性。例如，MCM-41框架中的铁物种比FeOx簇对CH4到HCHO由O2的转换更为有效。这强调了位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面的关键作用。

部分甲烷氧化和丙烯醇氧化在常压下使用固定床流化床反应器进行。这种设置允许控制条件，适用于这些反应，通过气相色谱法实现产物分离。

在合成铁含SBA-15材料时，无论添加了多少铁，仅能加载大约0.1 wt%的铁，这归因于SBA-15制备过程中的强酸介质。这一限制影响铁物种的负载量，并可能影响ODH反应的催化剂性能。
