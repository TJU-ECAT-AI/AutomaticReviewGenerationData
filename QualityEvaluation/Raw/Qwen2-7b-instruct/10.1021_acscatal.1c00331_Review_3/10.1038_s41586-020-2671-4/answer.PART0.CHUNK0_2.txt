[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petro-chemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3."
[2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
[3] "Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."
[4] "In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite."
[5] "Nevertheless,it is worth noting that the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga=598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size affects the diffusion of reactants and products, influencing the efficiency of the reaction. Connectivity determines how well the catalyst can handle the flow of gases, impacting the reaction rate. Uniformity ensures a consistent distribution of catalyst particles, leading to more homogeneous performance. Hierarchical arrangements, involving both micropores and mesopores, provide pathways for reactants and products, facilitating faster diffusion and enhancing the catalyst's ability to handle complex reactions. These relationships imply that designing optimal and effective catalysts requires careful consideration of the pore structure to minimize coke formation, optimize reactant diffusion, and maximize the catalyst's performance. By understanding these interactions, researchers can tailor catalyst supports to improve the efficiency and longevity of PDH reactions, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable processes.
