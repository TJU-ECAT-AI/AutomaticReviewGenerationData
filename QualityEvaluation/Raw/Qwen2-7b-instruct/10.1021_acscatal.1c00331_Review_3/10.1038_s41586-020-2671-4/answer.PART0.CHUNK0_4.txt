[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3."
[2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
[3] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
[4] "Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
[5] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
[6] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
[7] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
[8] "Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."
[9] "Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite."
[10] "Systematic exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetallic compounds with La."
[11] "The (010) and (001) reflection spots marked in yellow in the FFT image (Fig.1e) are characteristic of the L12 superlattice."
[12] "In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite."
[13] "The effect of the remaining Ga was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig.7."
[14] "Moreover, in a similar manner to PtLa/mz-deGa, PtY/mz-deGa also exhibited high initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity, and slow catalyst deactivation."
[15] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/ mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pore sizes can facilitate easier coke formation and accumulation, affecting the catalyst's efficiency and longevity. Connectivity and uniformity of pores ensure better distribution of reactants and products, improving the catalyst's performance. Hierarchical arrangements, combining both micro- and mesopores, offer enhanced diffusion paths for reactants and products, contributing to higher catalytic efficiency. These relationships imply that designing optimal and effective catalysts requires careful consideration of the support material's pore structure to minimize coke formation, maximize accommodation, and ensure efficient reaction kinetics.

The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts are profound. By understanding how pore structures impact coke formation and accommodation, researchers can tailor the support materials to prevent coke buildup, prolong catalyst life, and maintain high activity. This includes optimizing pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements to balance reactant diffusion, product release, and coke inhibition. Additionally, incorporating specific features like silanol nests can enable the formation of intermetallic alloys, enhancing the catalyst's stability and performance in PDH reactions. The ability to control alloy formation through pore structure manipulation opens new avenues for developing highly active and durable catalysts for various petrochemical processes, potentially revolutionizing the industry's efficiency and sustainability.
