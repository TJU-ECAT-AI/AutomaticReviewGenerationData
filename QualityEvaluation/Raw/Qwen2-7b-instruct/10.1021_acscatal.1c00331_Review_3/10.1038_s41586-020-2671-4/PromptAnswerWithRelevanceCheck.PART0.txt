[1] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
[3] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
[4] "The Pt nanoparticles in separation from the REEs exhibited an extremely short PDH catalytic lifetime, identical to that obtained without REE incorporation."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size affects the diffusion of reactants and products, while connectivity and uniformity impact the accessibility of reactants to the active sites and the ease of product release. Hierarchical arrangements can enhance both reactant and product diffusion and provide high metal nanoparticle dispersion, leading to improved catalytic performance. In the context of PDH reactions, the use of a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a catalyst support allows for better dispersion of precious metals like platinum (Pt), improving the initial catalytic activity and reducing the risk of coke formation. The presence of pore walls with surface framework defects, or 'silanol nests', facilitates the reduction of rare-earth elements (REEs) to single atomic species, enabling the formation of Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles. These alloy nanoparticles exhibit enhanced stability, activity, and selectivity in PDH reactions, demonstrating the significant influence of pore structure characteristics on catalyst performance.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pores can accommodate more coke, potentially leading to more severe coke formation and quicker catalyst deactivation. High pore connectivity facilitates easier coke diffusion, while uniform pore size ensures better reactant and product diffusion, enhancing catalyst performance. Hierarchical pore arrangements, combining micro- and mesopores, boost catalytic performance by providing optimal diffusion paths for reactants and products and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite pore walls acts as a critical factor for activating rare-earth elements (REEs) to form single atomic species with a higher chemical potential, enabling their easy conversion to metallic REEs and facilitating the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. This leads to improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability in PDH reactions. For industrial application, establishing an efficient regeneration method, like the oxychlorination process for PtSn/alumina catalysts, is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size affects the diffusion of reactants and products, influencing the efficiency of the reaction. Connectivity determines how well the catalyst can handle the flow of gases, impacting the reaction rate. Uniformity ensures a consistent distribution of catalyst particles, leading to more homogeneous performance. Hierarchical arrangements, involving both micropores and mesopores, provide pathways for reactants and products, facilitating faster diffusion and enhancing the catalyst's ability to handle complex reactions. These relationships imply that designing optimal and effective catalysts requires careful consideration of the pore structure to minimize coke formation, optimize reactant diffusion, and maximize the catalyst's performance. By understanding these interactions, researchers can tailor catalyst supports to improve the efficiency and longevity of PDH reactions, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable processes.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a support instead of alumina allows for improved dispersion of Pt catalysts, especially when combined with rare-earth elements (REEs) like La and Y. These REEs have strong metal-support interactions with Pt, stabilizing the latter in the form of small nanoparticles. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite supports, which can be created by generating degallated sites during synthesis, facilitates the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles. The concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite can thus control the formation of these alloy nanoparticles. The use of a zeolite support containing a small amount of gallium (Ga) can also affect catalyst performance, possibly enhancing catalytic function or alloy formation. Catalysts like PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa, which contain alloy nanoparticles, exhibit high initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity, along with slow deactivation. These findings suggest that the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions can benefit from the strategic use of zeolite supports with specific pore structures and functionalities. For industrial applications, establishing efficient regeneration methods, such as the oxychlorination process used for PtSn/alumina catalysts, remains crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over multiple cycles.

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pore sizes can facilitate easier coke formation and accumulation, affecting the catalyst's efficiency and longevity. Connectivity and uniformity of pores ensure better distribution of reactants and products, improving the catalyst's performance. Hierarchical arrangements, combining both micro- and mesopores, offer enhanced diffusion paths for reactants and products, contributing to higher catalytic efficiency. These relationships imply that designing optimal and effective catalysts requires careful consideration of the support material's pore structure to minimize coke formation, maximize accommodation, and ensure efficient reaction kinetics.

The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts are profound. By understanding how pore structures impact coke formation and accommodation, researchers can tailor the support materials to prevent coke buildup, prolong catalyst life, and maintain high activity. This includes optimizing pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements to balance reactant diffusion, product release, and coke inhibition. Additionally, incorporating specific features like silanol nests can enable the formation of intermetallic alloys, enhancing the catalyst's stability and performance in PDH reactions. The ability to control alloy formation through pore structure manipulation opens new avenues for developing highly active and durable catalysts for various petrochemical processes, potentially revolutionizing the industry's efficiency and sustainability.
