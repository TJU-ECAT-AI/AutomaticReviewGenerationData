[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3."
[2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
[3] "Coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
[4] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
[5] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
[6] "The Pt nanoparticles in separation from the REEs exhibited an extremely short PDH catalytic lifetime, identical to that obtained without REE incorporation."
[7] "In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite."
[8] "Nevertheless,it is worth noting that the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga=598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."
[9] "Moreover, in a similar manner to PtLa/mz-deGa, PtY/mz-deGa also exhibited high initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity, and slow catalyst deactivation."
[10] "For industrial application of the zeolite-supported catalysts, it would be important to establish an efficient regeneration method, such as the oxychlorination process employed for PtSn/alumina."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a support instead of alumina allows for improved dispersion of Pt catalysts, especially when combined with rare-earth elements (REEs) like La and Y. These REEs have strong metal-support interactions with Pt, stabilizing the latter in the form of small nanoparticles. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite supports, which can be created by generating degallated sites during synthesis, facilitates the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles. The concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite can thus control the formation of these alloy nanoparticles. The use of a zeolite support containing a small amount of gallium (Ga) can also affect catalyst performance, possibly enhancing catalytic function or alloy formation. Catalysts like PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa, which contain alloy nanoparticles, exhibit high initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity, along with slow deactivation. These findings suggest that the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions can benefit from the strategic use of zeolite supports with specific pore structures and functionalities. For industrial applications, establishing efficient regeneration methods, such as the oxychlorination process used for PtSn/alumina catalysts, remains crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over multiple cycles.

催化剂支撑孔结构特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级排列，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中显著影响焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。使用具有微/介孔结构的硅质MFI沸石作为支持物代替氧化铝来作为催化剂支持，可以改善铂催化剂的分散，特别是在与镧（La）、钇（Y）等稀土元素结合时。这些稀土元素与铂之间有很强的金属-支撑相互作用，稳定后者形成小纳米颗粒。在沸石支持物中的硅醇巢的存在，可以通过生成去镓（Ga）位点来创造，有助于形成PtREE合金纳米颗粒。因此，可以通过控制沸石中硅醇巢的浓度来控制这些合金纳米颗粒的形成。即使在去镓处理后，包含少量镓（Ga）的沸石支持物也可以影响催化剂性能，可能增强催化功能或促进合金形成。PtLa/mz-deGa和PtY/mz-deGa这类包含合金纳米颗粒的催化剂表现出高初始丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，以及缓慢的催化剂失活。这些发现表明，通过策略性地利用具有特定孔结构和功能性的沸石支持物，可以设计出适用于PDH反应的最优和高效催化剂。对于工业应用而言，建立高效的再生方法，例如用于PtSn/氧化铝催化剂的氧氯化过程，对于维持催化剂性能的多个周期至关重要。
