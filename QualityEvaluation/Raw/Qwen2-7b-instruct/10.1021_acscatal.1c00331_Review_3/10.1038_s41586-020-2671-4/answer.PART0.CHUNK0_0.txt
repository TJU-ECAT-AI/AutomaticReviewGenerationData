[1] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
[3] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
[4] "The Pt nanoparticles in separation from the REEs exhibited an extremely short PDH catalytic lifetime, identical to that obtained without REE incorporation."
[5] "The rapid deactivation behaviour of the PtLa/mz catalyst was similar to that of the monometallic Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous zeolite (Pt/mz), consistent with the hydrogen chemisorption property of the PtLa/mz sample."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size affects the diffusion of reactants and products, while connectivity and uniformity impact the accessibility of reactants to the active sites and the ease of product release. Hierarchical arrangements can enhance both reactant and product diffusion and provide high metal nanoparticle dispersion, leading to improved catalytic performance. In the context of PDH reactions, the use of a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a catalyst support allows for better dispersion of precious metals like platinum (Pt), improving the initial catalytic activity and reducing the risk of coke formation. The presence of pore walls with surface framework defects, or 'silanol nests', facilitates the reduction of rare-earth elements (REEs) to single atomic species, enabling the formation of Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles. These alloy nanoparticles exhibit enhanced stability, activity, and selectivity in PDH reactions, demonstrating the significant influence of pore structure characteristics on catalyst performance.
