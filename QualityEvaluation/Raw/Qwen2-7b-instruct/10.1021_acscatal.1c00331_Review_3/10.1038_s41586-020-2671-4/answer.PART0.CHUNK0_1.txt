[1] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[2] "We believe that the silanol nests could stabilize the single atomic REE species by forming coordination bonds16."
[3] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability."
[4] "For industrial application of the zeolite-supported catalysts, it would be important to establish an efficient regeneration method, such as the oxychlorination process employed for PtSn/alumina."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pores can accommodate more coke, potentially leading to more severe coke formation and quicker catalyst deactivation. High pore connectivity facilitates easier coke diffusion, while uniform pore size ensures better reactant and product diffusion, enhancing catalyst performance. Hierarchical pore arrangements, combining micro- and mesopores, boost catalytic performance by providing optimal diffusion paths for reactants and products and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite pore walls acts as a critical factor for activating rare-earth elements (REEs) to form single atomic species with a higher chemical potential, enabling their easy conversion to metallic REEs and facilitating the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. This leads to improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability in PDH reactions. For industrial application, establishing an efficient regeneration method, like the oxychlorination process for PtSn/alumina catalysts, is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

催化剂支撑孔结构特征，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能产生了显著影响。较大的孔径可能容纳更多焦炭，导致更严重的焦炭形成和更快的催化剂失活。高孔隙连通性有助于焦炭的更容易扩散，而均匀的孔径确保了更好的反应物和产物扩散，从而增强催化剂性能。层级孔结构，结合微孔和介孔，通过提供优化的反应物和产物扩散路径以及介孔中的纳米颗粒分散，提升了催化性能。在沸石孔壁上存在的硅醇巢作为关键因素，激活稀有地球元素（REEs）形成单原子物种，具有更高的化学势，使其容易转化为金属REEs，并促进形成互金属合金纳米颗粒。这导致PDH反应中提高了催化活性、选择性和耐用性。对于工业应用而言，建立一种高效的再生方法，比如PtSn/氧化铝催化剂所采用的氧氯化过程，对于维持催化剂性能至关重要。
