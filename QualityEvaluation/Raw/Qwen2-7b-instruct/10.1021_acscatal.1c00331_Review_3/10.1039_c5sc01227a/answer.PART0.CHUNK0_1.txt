[1] "In order to explore computationally the robustness of a catalytic system against coking,different parameters have been proposed as a measure for the susceptibility of a system to coking. One of the earlier studies have proposed to consider the C adsorption energy ,134 while a more recent study advocated the consideration the rate ratio for the oxidation of surface CH and C groups (rCH/rC) as well as the rate for the cleavage of carbon monoxide.132"
[2] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[3] "Although low dehydrogenation barrier indicates high dehydrogenation activity for a catalyst,too high dehydrogenation activity might result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, where in the worst case results in undesired coke formation."
[4] "In more complicated cases such as oxides, the react molecules can induce change of the structure of a catalyst, creating vacancies or oxidizing surface metal atoms, result in a large amount of different types of sites for elementary reactions and dramatically increase the computational complexibility."

1. Parameters like the C adsorption energy, the rate ratio for the oxidation of surface CH and C groups (rCH/rC), and the rate for the cleavage of carbon monoxide have been proposed to evaluate a catalyst's susceptibility to coking. 
2. The overarching aim of theoretical studies is to pinpoint the most efficient catalysts for specific chemical reactions.
3. A low dehydrogenation barrier suggests high reactivity, but excessively high activity can lead to unintended deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, potentially causing coke formation.
4. Complex systems, like oxides, pose challenges due to the ability of reactants to alter catalyst structure, creating diverse reaction sites that escalate computational complexity.
