"Coke may, for instance, form if carbon centers are completely dehydrogenated but not removed from the catalyst surface."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The origins of coke formation in alkane activation processes stem from the complete dehydrogenation of carbon centers without their removal from the catalyst surface. Coke can form in various forms, such as on-surface, subsurface, forming a carbidic phase, or as graphene islands covering the catalyst surface. Strategies to prevent coke formation include alloying the catalyst with elements like gold or tin, which hinder the formation of coke, and adding elements such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron to occupy crucial sites, thereby avoiding the formation of graphene islands. Additionally, maintaining a balance between hydrogen and alkane pressures can prevent the formation of coke precursors and hinder deep dehydrogenation.

焦炭形成的原因是碳中心完全脱氢但未从催化剂表面去除。焦炭可以以表面、亚表面、形成碳化物相或覆盖催化剂表面的石墨烯岛等各种形式存在。防止焦炭形成的方法包括合金化催化剂，加入金或锡等元素，这些元素可以阻止焦炭的形成；添加钾、硫、金或硼等元素来占据关键位点，从而避免形成石墨烯岛。此外，通过保持氢和烷烃压力之间的平衡，可以防止形成焦炭前体并阻碍深度脱氢。

"Similar to Ni, experimental and DFT studies on Co have shown that coke can be present as graphene islands as well as in the form of a surface carbide."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Similar to nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) has been shown in both experimental and Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies to form coke in the form of graphene islands as well as a surface carbide. This indicates that Co, like Ni, can exhibit coke formation in two primary configurations on its surface.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
与镍（Ni）类似，实验和密度泛函理论（DFT）研究显示，钴（Co）也可以在两种主要配置上形成焦炭：石墨烯岛以及表面碳化物。这表明Co，就像Ni一样，其表面可以出现两种类型的焦炭形成。
