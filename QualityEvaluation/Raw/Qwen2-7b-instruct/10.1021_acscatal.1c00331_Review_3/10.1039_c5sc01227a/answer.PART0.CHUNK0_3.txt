[1] "The most obverse signature for this series of reactions is the relatively high barriers for the first (D1) and last (D4) dehydrogenation steps,among many of which the barriers are higher than 100 kJ mol-1."

[2] "The electronic effect is influenced by the relative stability of dehydrogenated intermediates. CH is the most stable surface intermediate during the dehydrogenation process."

[3] "In contrast, the barriers for D2 and D3 steps are mostly less than 80 kJ mol-1, and can be even as low as < 10 kJ mol-1."

[4] "The electronic effect is influenced by the relative stability of dehydrogenated intermediates. CH is the most stable surface intermediate during the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "The barriers of the other three steps are < 65 kJ mol-1."

[6] "Interestingly, all four dehydrogenation barriers on Ni(100) are lower than the corresponding ones on Ni(111), which has been connected to the higher d band center of Ni(100) surface (-1.64 eV) than of Ni(111) (-1.78 eV)."

[7] "The binding of surface intermediates tends to be stronger on (211) surfaces than it on corresponding terrace (111), due to the low coordinated nature of step edge atoms."

[8] "The calculated reaction energies and barriers of elementary steps provide useful clues to interpret the reaction mechanism, a more reliable way is to solve the steady- state at reaction conditions based on the calculated kinetic and thermodynamic information."

[9] "On Ni(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol-1, which is 66 kJ mol-1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier."

[10] "The existence of Au atoms shifts down the d band of alloys, which weakens the interaction between σ* of C-H bond and d states of surface metal atoms."

[11] "In the case of ethane, the undesired acetaldehyde can be formed on the single coordinated O site with a barrier that is slightly lower than the barrier associated with ethylene formation."

[12] "The presence of this easily accessible side reaction significantly lower the efficiency of ethane ODH, which was suggested to be the reason for the low ODH activity of ethane on V2O5."

[13] "The critical size has been estimated to be between 10 to 80 C atoms."

[14] "It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separates the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other."

[15] "It could be shown that the presence of B may prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on Co, comparable to the case for Ni described above."

1. The dehydrogenation activity and selectivity of metal surfaces in methane activation are influenced by electronic and geometric properties. High barriers for the first and last dehydrogenation steps are associated with the activation of methane, while lower barriers for intermediate steps facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

2. Electronic properties affect the stability of dehydrogenated intermediates. CH is the most stable surface intermediate, and its stability impacts the activation of methane.

3. Geometric properties influence the activation of methane. For instance, the coordination number of surface atoms determines the binding strength of intermediates, affecting the dehydrogenation barriers.

4. The electronic and geometric properties of metal surfaces, such as d band center and coordination number, determine the dehydrogenation barriers and mechanisms for methane. Lower barriers are associated with stronger surface binding and higher dehydrogenation activity.

5. Particle size affects the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity of catalysts. Larger particles tend to produce branched products, while smaller particles generate a statistical distribution of branched and linear products.

6. Oxide catalysts with specific surface oxygen coordination can influence the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the formation of coke, affecting the overall catalytic performance.

7. Strategies to enhance Ni catalyst robustness against coking include alloying with Au, Sn, and other metals, which alter electronic properties and surface structure to inhibit coke formation.

8. Zeolite frameworks and pore topology influence dehydrogenation activity by altering the accessibility and reactivity of catalyst sites.

9. Single atom catalysts offer advantages in terms of metal utilization and selectivity, but their complex integration into practical catalysts remains a challenge.

10. Coke formation during organic species reactions involves the accumulation of carbon centers, leading to catalyst deactivation. Prevention strategies focus on controlling carbon deposition and enhancing surface stability.
