[1] "The formation of graphene-islands type coke on Ni is analogous to the growth of carbon nanotubes.130 This reaction has been described as a process consisting of multiple steps128,130 starting with the decomposition of carbon containing gas phase species yielding C centers on the catalyst surface."
[2] "Once the C centers agglomerate at the suitable facet sites, graphene-islands can be formed and eventually deactivate the Ni catalyst by encapsulating the metal surface."
[3] "It has been shown that during the Ni-catalyzed water-gas shift reaction, less coke is expected to form at terrace sites of the catalyst compared to the situation at steps, as the flat surface is less active for the formation of C centers via CO scission."
[4] "Similar to Ni, experimental and DFT studies on Co have shown that coke can be present as graphene islands as well as in the form of a surface carbide."
[5] "An example is the decomposition of methanol studied on Pd cluster models.141 It could be shown that CH3 and CH2 species formed from the C-O cleavage of methanol tend to move to the thermodynamically more stable near-edge sites of the cluster where they further dehydrogenate to CH or C."
[6] "Despite the fact that this result appears rather intuitive, it should be noted that underlying molecular processes are far more complex."
[7] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."

1. The formation of coke on Ni is similar to the growth of carbon nanotubes, initiated by the decomposition of carbon-containing gas-phase species into carbon centers on the catalyst surface. These centers then aggregate at suitable facet sites, leading to the formation of graphene islands that deactivate the Ni catalyst by encapsulating it.

2. Graphene islands are more likely to form at terrace sites on Ni catalysts during the water-gas shift reaction, as the flat surface is less conducive to the formation of C centers via CO scission compared to steps.

3. Similar to Ni, Co also exhibits the formation of coke in the form of graphene islands and surface carbide. 

4. In the context of methanol decomposition on Pd cluster models, CH3 and CH2 species originating from C-O cleavage tend to migrate to thermodynamically more stable near-edge sites within the cluster, where they further dehydrogenate to CH or C. This finding aligns with experimental observations of carbon species at near-edge sites in Pd catalysts.

5. The underlying molecular processes involved in these reactions are significantly more intricate than initially perceived.

6. The overarching objective of theoretical studies is to pinpoint catalysts that are optimal for specific chemical processes.

1. 镍催化剂上的焦炭形成类似于碳纳米管的生长，始于气体相中含碳物种的分解，生成催化剂表面的碳中心。这些中心在合适的晶面位置聚集，形成覆盖催化剂表面的石墨烯岛屿，最终使镍催化剂失活。

2. 在水煤气变换反应中，与步骤相比，平滑表面更少地促进通过CO裂解产生碳中心，因此预计在催化剂的台阶区域形成较少的焦炭。

3. 类似于镍，钴也表现出以石墨烯岛和表面碳化物形式存在的焦炭。

4. 在钯簇模型中研究甲醇分解时，从甲醇C-O键断裂产生的CH3和CH2物种倾向于迁移到簇的热力学上更稳定的近边缘位点，在那里它们进一步脱氢为CH或C。这一发现与钯催化剂中近边缘位点上的碳物种的实验观察一致。

5. 这些反应背后的分子过程比最初想象的要复杂得多。

6. 理论研究的最终目标是确定特定化学过程的理想催化剂。
