[1] "In the case of zeolite catalyzed alkane dehydrogenation reactions, two different mechanisms have been proposed by previous theoretical studies: one proceeding via an alkyl intermediate and an alternative mechanism via a carbenium ion."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes in zeolites can be promoted by extra-framework metal atoms, such as Zn, In, Ga and Cu, which create new Lewis acid sites in zeolites."
[3] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol-1 or more, than the analogue process on a pure Ni(111) surface."
[4] "Similar to Ni, experimental and DFT studies on Co have shown that coke can be present as graphene islands as well as in the form of a surface carbide."

1. Two different mechanisms for alkane dehydrogenation in zeolites have been proposed: one involving an alkyl intermediate and another through a carbenium ion.

2. Extra-framework metal atoms like Zn, In, Ga, and Cu can enhance alkane dehydrogenation in zeolites by creating new Lewis acid sites.

3. Adsorption of carbon atoms on the surface of a NiAu alloy is thermodynamically less favorable compared to a pure Ni(111) surface, by 23 kJ mol-1 or more.

4. Studies on cobalt have shown that coke can form as graphene islands or a surface carbide, similar to nickel.

1. 在沸石催化烷烃脱氢反应中，提出了两种不同的机制：一种通过烷基中间体，另一种通过碳正离子。

2. 如锌、铟、镓和铜等额外框架金属原子可以通过在沸石中形成新的路易斯酸中心来促进烷烃脱氢。

3. 碳原子在镍金合金表面的吸附比纯镍（111）表面更不有利于吸附，相差23 kJ mol-1或更多。

4. 对钴的研究表明，焦炭可以以石墨烯岛的形式或表面碳化物的形式存在，类似于镍。
