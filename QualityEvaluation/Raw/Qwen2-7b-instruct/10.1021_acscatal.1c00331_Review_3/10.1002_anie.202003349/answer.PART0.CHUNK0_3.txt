Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a significant role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. In the context of the literature provided, the introduction of zinc (Zn) species within the silicalite-1 zeolite support material promotes the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters. This not only enhances the catalytic activity of the Pt clusters but also significantly improves their stability. The use of a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method allows for the efficient encapsulation of subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters, leading to an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5 mol/gPt/h) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 108 h^-1 and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550°C. Remarkably, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 minutes of operation (WHSV=3.6 h^-1), surpassing the stability of any other state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for PDH reactions to date. Additionally, the incorporation of cesium (Cs+) ions into the zeolite can significantly enhance the regeneration stability of the catalysts, enabling the catalytic activity to remain unchanged after four successive regeneration cycles. These findings suggest that optimizing the design of catalyst support materials, particularly focusing on pore structure characteristics, can lead to the development of high-performance catalysts with exceptional stability and regeneration capabilities for PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，催化剂支持孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构排列，在影响焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能方面起着重要作用。根据提供的文献，在此背景下，锌（Zn）物种在硅铝酸盐-1分子筛支持材料中的引入促进了超小PtZn合金簇的形成。这不仅增强了铂簇的催化活性，而且显著提高了其稳定性。通过使用配体保护的直接氢还原方法，可以有效地封装纳米尺度双金属PtZn簇，从而获得极高的丙烯生成特定活性（65.5 mol/gPt/h）和重量小时空间速度（WHSV）为108 h^-1的丙烯选择性达到99.3%，在550°C下。值得注意的是，即使在没有协同提供氢气的情况下运行13000分钟（WHSV=3.6 h^-1），也没有明显的失活现象，这是迄今为止所有最先进的Pt基异质催化剂在PDH反应中表现出来的最高稳定性。此外，向分子筛中引入铯（Cs+）离子可以显著提高催化剂的再生性能，使得在四次连续再生循环后，催化活性保持不变。这些发现表明，优化催化剂支持材料的设计，特别是关注孔结构特征，可以导致开发出高性能催化剂，具有出色的稳定性和再生能力。
