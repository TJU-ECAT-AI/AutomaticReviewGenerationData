<p>Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs.</p>
<p>However, supporting metal species on zeolites by using conventional impregnation methods usually generates large metal particles with poor dispersion.</p>
<p>Exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species is of great significance yet remains a nontrivial target for PDH industry.</p>
<p>Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four continuous cycles.</p>

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a critical role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Large pores facilitate easier coke formation and accumulation, which can block active sites and reduce catalyst efficiency. High connectivity and uniformity of the pore structure enable better accommodation of reactants and products, promoting efficient mass transfer. Hierarchical pore structures, combining both macropores and mesopores, offer advantages in accommodating different-sized molecules and facilitating both diffusion and adsorption processes, enhancing the overall catalytic activity and stability. The presence of Cs+ ions within the zeolite channels can significantly improve the regeneration stability of the catalyst, ensuring that the catalytic activity remains stable after multiple regeneration cycles. This is due to the effective inhibition of metal migration to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, which prevents severe aggregation of metal species and maintains the confinement effect of zeolites. The design of catalyst supports with optimized pore structures is crucial for achieving high-performance and long-term stability in PDH reactions.
