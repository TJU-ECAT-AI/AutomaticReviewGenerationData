[1] "Significantly, the introduction of Zn species can remarkably promote the catalytic activity and stability of Pt clusters through to the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters."
[2] "Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over catalyst even after 13000min on stream."
[3] "We also found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can significantly improve the regeneration performance and the catalytic activity remained stable after four successive regeneration cycles."

1. The introduction of zinc species notably enhances the catalytic activity and stability of platinum clusters by forming tiny platinum-zinc alloy clusters.
2. There was no noticeable deactivation observed over the catalyst even after 13000 minutes of operation.
3. We discovered that introducing cesium ions significantly boosts the catalyst's regeneration performance, keeping its activity stable after four consecutive regeneration cycles.
