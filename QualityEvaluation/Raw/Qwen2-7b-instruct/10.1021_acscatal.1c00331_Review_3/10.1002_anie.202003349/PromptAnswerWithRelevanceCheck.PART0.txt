The pore structures of catalyst supports, including their size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a critical role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pores can facilitate the accommodation and transport of reactants and products, reducing the likelihood of coke formation and improving catalyst performance. However, they also pose risks of increased coke formation if not properly managed. The connectivity of pores affects the diffusion of reactants and products, impacting the reaction kinetics. Uniformity ensures consistent reaction conditions throughout the catalyst, enhancing performance stability. Hierarchical arrangements of pores can optimize the balance between pore size and connectivity, further reducing coke formation while maintaining high activity. The specific pore structure of the zeolite in this study, with its ordered microporous structure and outstanding thermal stability, allowed for the encapsulation of subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters, contributing to high propylene selectivity and stability.

The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include prioritizing pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements that balance coke prevention with high activity. The design should aim to minimize coke formation pathways, ensure efficient reactant and product diffusion, maintain consistent reaction conditions, and optimize the confinement of metal species to prevent aggregation. The use of zeolites, with their well-defined pore structures, offers a promising avenue for achieving these objectives, as demonstrated by the high-performance PtZn@zeolite catalyst developed in this study.

The introduction of Zn species notably improved the stability of the Pt clusters, enabling a super-high propylene selectivity of 99.3% with specific activity of propylene formation reaching 65.5 mol gPt−1h−1 at 550°C. The absence of deactivation over 13000 minutes of operation without co-feeding H2 suggests an exceptionally low deactivation constant, highlighting the effectiveness of Zn incorporation in stabilizing the Pt clusters. The enhancement of regeneration stability by introducing Cs+ ions further underscores the importance of managing catalyst properties for prolonged operational life, ensuring that the catalyst can maintain high performance after multiple regeneration cycles.

催化剂支持孔结构的特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级化排列，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。较大的孔径有助于促进反应物和产物的容纳与运输，降低焦炭形成的可能，同时提高催化剂性能。然而，如果管理不当，也存在增加焦炭形成的风险。孔径的连通性影响反应物和产物的扩散，影响反应动力学。均匀性确保在整个催化剂中保持一致的反应条件，增强性能稳定性。层级化的孔结构可以优化孔径大小与连通性的平衡，进一步减少焦炭形成，同时维持高活性。特定孔结构的沸石，具有有序的微孔结构和出色的热稳定性，允许封装纳米级双金属PtZn簇，贡献于高丙烯选择性和稳定性。

这些关系对于设计最佳和有效催化剂的启示在于，优先考虑平衡焦炭预防与高活性的孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级化排列。设计应旨在最小化焦炭形成路径，确保高效反应物和产物扩散，维持一致的反应条件，并优化金属物种的封装以防止聚集。利用沸石特有的孔结构提供了一个有前景的途径，以实现这些目标，正如本研究中开发的高性能PtZn@沸石催化剂所展示的那样。

Zn元素的引入显著提高了Pt簇的稳定性，实现了高达99.3%的超高丙烯选择性以及在550°C下每小时每克铂生成丙烯的特定活性达到65.5 mol gPt−1h−1。在长达13000分钟的操作时间内未观察到明显失活，表明其低失活常数极低，强调了Zn掺入在稳定Pt簇方面的重要性。通过引入Cs+离子来显著增强再生稳定性，进一步凸显了管理催化剂属性以延长使用寿命的重要性，确保催化剂在多次再生循环后仍能保持高水平性能。

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a critical role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Large pores facilitate easier coke formation and accumulation, which can block active sites and reduce catalyst efficiency. High connectivity and uniformity of the pore structure enable better accommodation of reactants and products, promoting efficient mass transfer. Hierarchical pore structures, combining both macropores and mesopores, offer advantages in accommodating different-sized molecules and facilitating both diffusion and adsorption processes, enhancing the overall catalytic activity and stability. The presence of Cs+ ions within the zeolite channels can significantly improve the regeneration stability of the catalyst, ensuring that the catalytic activity remains stable after multiple regeneration cycles. This is due to the effective inhibition of metal migration to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, which prevents severe aggregation of metal species and maintains the confinement effect of zeolites. The design of catalyst supports with optimized pore structures is crucial for achieving high-performance and long-term stability in PDH reactions.

催化剂支持孔结构特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能具有重要影响。大孔易于促进焦炭形成和积累，可能阻塞活性位点并降低催化剂效率。高连通性和均匀性的孔结构能够更好地容纳反应物和产物，促进有效质量传输。包含不同大小分子的层级孔结构结合大孔和介孔，可以提供优势，同时促进扩散和吸附过程，增强整体催化活性和稳定性。Cs+离子在沸石通道中的存在可以显著提高催化剂的再生稳定性，确保催化活性在多次再生周期后保持稳定。这是由于有效地抑制金属迁移到沸石晶体表面，避免了金属物种严重聚集，并维持了沸石的限制效果。设计具有优化孔结构的催化剂支持对于实现PDH反应的高性能和长期稳定性至关重要。

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a significant role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. In the context of the literature provided, the introduction of zinc (Zn) species within the silicalite-1 zeolite support material promotes the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters. This not only enhances the catalytic activity of the Pt clusters but also significantly improves their stability. The use of a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method allows for the efficient encapsulation of subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters, leading to an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5 mol/gPt/h) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 108 h^-1 and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550°C. Remarkably, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 minutes of operation (WHSV=3.6 h^-1), surpassing the stability of any other state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for PDH reactions to date. Additionally, the incorporation of cesium (Cs+) ions into the zeolite can significantly enhance the regeneration stability of the catalysts, enabling the catalytic activity to remain unchanged after four successive regeneration cycles. These findings suggest that optimizing the design of catalyst support materials, particularly focusing on pore structure characteristics, can lead to the development of high-performance catalysts with exceptional stability and regeneration capabilities for PDH reactions.
