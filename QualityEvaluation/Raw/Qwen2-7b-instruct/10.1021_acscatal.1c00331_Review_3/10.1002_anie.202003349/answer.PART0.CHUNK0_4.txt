[1] "The introduction of Zn species can remarkably promote the catalytic activity and stability of Pt clusters through to the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters."
[2] "The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C."
[3] "Significantly, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), the highest stability to date among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction."
[4] "We also found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can significantly improve the regeneration performance and the catalytic activity remained stable after four successive regeneration cycles."

1. The introduction of zinc (Zn) species significantly enhances the catalytic activity and stability of platinum (Pt) clusters by forming ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters.

2. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst shows exceptional performance, with a high specific activity for propylene formation (65.5 mol/g of Pt per hour) at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 108 h^-1 and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550°C.

3. This catalyst maintains high propane conversion (40.4%) and high propylene selectivity (99.2%) even after 13,000 minutes of operation (WHSV = 3.6 h^-1), demonstrating unparalleled stability compared to other state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts for PDH reactions.

4. The incorporation of cesium (Cs+) ions significantly improves the catalyst's regeneration performance, allowing the catalytic activity to remain stable after four consecutive regeneration cycles.

1. 锌（Zn）物种的引入显著提高了铂（Pt）簇的催化活性和稳定性，通过形成超小PtZn合金簇。

2. PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂表现出卓越性能，具有在108 h^-1的重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下65.5 mol/g Pt每小时的高丙烯形成特定活性，在550°C时丙烯选择性为99.3%。

3. 在长达13,000分钟的操作时间（WHSV = 3.6 h^-1）后，该催化剂仍能保持40.4%的丙烷转化率和99.2%的丙烯选择性，显示与PDH反应中所有最先进的Pt基催化剂相比，其稳定性无可比拟。

4. 碘化铯（Cs+）离子的引入显著改善了催化剂的再生性能，使得催化活性在四次连续再生循环后保持稳定。
