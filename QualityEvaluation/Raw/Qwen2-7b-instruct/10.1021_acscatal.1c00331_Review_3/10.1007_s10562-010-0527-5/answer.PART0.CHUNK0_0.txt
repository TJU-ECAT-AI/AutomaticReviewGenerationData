[1] "The oxygen mobility of the supports was demonstrated as an important catalyst property that could decrease the coke combustion temperature, resulting in a low sintering rate of the metallic phase."
[2] "The coke combustion temperatures increased following the reverse order of oxygen mobility of the supports: CeZrO2 > CeO2 > MgO > Al2O3 > SBA-15, implying that the oxygen transfer over supports was a rate-determining step in the coke combustion process."
[3] "A strong relationship confirms that the oxygen mobility over the supports is a key variable that remarkably influences the coke combustion temperature; the higher oxygen mobility over the support leads to a lower coke combustion temperature during the catalyst regeneration."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the pore size and connectivity of the support affect the accommodation and movement of coke, while uniformity and hierarchical arrangements impact the distribution and stability of the coke. These relationships imply that designing catalysts with optimal pore structures can lead to enhanced performance, reduced coke formation, and improved catalyst longevity. The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include careful selection of support materials with appropriate pore properties and configurations that minimize coke formation and facilitate efficient coke combustion during regeneration processes.
