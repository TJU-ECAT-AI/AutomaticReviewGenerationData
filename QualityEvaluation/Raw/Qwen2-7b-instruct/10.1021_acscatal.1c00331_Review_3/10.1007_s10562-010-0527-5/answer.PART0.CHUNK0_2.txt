298K
R
= 124 kJ/mol), the desired reaction requires a high temperature (commercially viable conversion requires a temperature greater than 500 C) and low pressure where, unfortunately, coke formation is promoted and a catalyst can be deactivated quickly [1, 2].
Various commercial catalysts have been developed for propane dehydrogenation: chromia-alumina (ABB Lummus Global), Pt/alumina with alkali, Cu, and Zn used as promoters (UOP LLC), and Pt/zinc aluminate with Sn used as a promoter (Phillips Petroleum) [3]. Although many efforts have been made to modify Pt-supported catalysts, deactivation due to coking is still not completely overcome, and catalysts must undergo continuous or frequent regeneration processes to restore the catalytic activity [410].
Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2. The temperature required to gasify the carbon deposits at a reasonable rate varies with the type of gas, the structure and reactivity of the coke, and the activity of the catalyst. Walker and co-workers [11] reported the following order for rates of uncatalyzed gasification: O2 > H2O > CO2 > H2. Since the catalyzed removal of coke with oxygen is generally very rapid at moderate temperatures, industrial processes typically regenerate the Pt-based catalysts deactivated by coke with a gas containing oxygen, followed by a redisperison step with a chlorine-containing gas [1216]. One of key technologies in air regeneration is avoiding hot spots or over-temperatures that result in undesirable operations, including further catalyst deactivation via sintering of the active phase and damage to reaction equipment [17].
In our previous report [18], we proposed that the different oxidation temperature of coke over Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts originated from differences in oxygen mobility of the support. In this study, the influence of oxygen mobility over supported Pt catalysts on coke combustion was systematically investigated in the regeneration of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Five supported Pt catalysts (Pt/SBA-15, Pt/Al2O3, Pt/MgO, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2) were prepared using supports with different oxygen mobilities. The oxygen mobility of the supports was demonstrated as an important catalyst property that could decrease the coke combustion temperature, resulting in a low sintering rate of the metallic phase. 2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
Alumina and an SBA-15 support were prepared following previous reports [1820]. MgO was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (99.99% trace metal basis). Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Two grams of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%) was dissolved in 1 mL deionized water. Then, one aliquot containing 200 μL precursor was evenly dispersed over 1.0 g ZrO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%). This procedure was repeated until the ratio of liquid to support was 1.0 mL/g. Catalysts were dried for 24 h at room temperature in a vacuum hood before drying at 100 C for 12 h, and calcination was performed at 550 C for 6 h. The above procedure was repeated two more times to obtain the nominal stoichiometric Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 oxide. Cerium oxide material with uniform mesopores and a fine particle morphology was synthesized using Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%) as the cerium source, followed by removal of the hard template using a 12 M NaOH solution [21].
The 3% (wt%) platinum loaded onto supports was prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation technique. H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 37.5% Pt basis) precursor was dissolved in a predetermined amount of deionized water where its volume was equal to the pore volume of each support. One aliquot containing 200 μL precursor was evenly dispersed over the calcined supports. This procedure was repeated until the ratio of liquid to support was 1.0 mL/g. Catalysts were dried at room temperature for 24 h at 100 C for 12 h in an oven, and calcined at 550 C for 6 h in a furnace.
2.2 Catalytic Tests
Catalytic tests were performed in a U-shaped, fixed-bed quartz microreactor at atmospheric pressure and 600 C. The catalyst (100 mg) was reduced in situ in pure H2 (50 mL/min) at 600 C for 3 h and then purged by N2 (100 mL/min) for 10 min to remove the remaining H2. Then, the reaction mixture consisting of N2 (100 mL/min) and C3H8 (30 mL/min) was fed into the reactor. The product was sampled at different intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC, South Korea). A flame ionization detector and a 30 m × 0.53 mm HP-PLOT Al2O3 KCl capillary column were used. The initial and final conversions of each catalyst are listed in Table 1. The conversion was calculated using the following equation:$$ {\text{Propane conversion }}\left( \% \right) = {\frac{{n({\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{8} )_{\text{in}} \, - n({\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{8} )_{\text{out}} }}{{n({\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{8} )_{\text{in}} }}} \times 100 $$ where n(C3H8)in and n(C3H8)out are the moles of propane from the inlet and outlet, respectively.

2.3 Catalyst Characterizations
The surface areas and pore size distributions of the catalysts were characterized by a nitrogen sorption technique (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA). The samples were degassed under vacuum at 300 C for 4 h prior to analysis and measured at 196.15 C using an automatic analyzer.
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2200 powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray tube was operated at 35 kV, 20 mA; the two theta angle was scanned from 10 to 100 (step wise 0.02) at a speed of 2/min.
The coke combustion of spent catalysts was conducted by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments Q50, USA) with a mixture of air (40 mL/min) and nitrogen (60 mL/min). The different heating rates (5, 10, 20, and 40 C/min) were applied to calculate the activation energy of the oxidation reaction between coke and oxygen, following the method reported by Ozawa [22, 23]:$$ \log (\Upphi ) = B-0.4567\left( {E/R \cdot T_{{{\text{x}}\% }} } \right) $$ where B is a constant value depending on the chemical reaction, E is the activation energy, and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K). Using linear regression analysis between log(Φ) and reciprocal of T x%, the activation energy can be obtained from the slope of the straight line. 3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalyst Properties
The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorptiondesorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1). To identify crystal structures and measure the Pt particle sizes, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for each catalyst were obtained (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, the Pt metal phase (PDF No. 00-004-0802) was only detected on the SBA-15 support, resulting in no information on the Pt particle sizes. Furthermore, although the CO/Pt values were attempted through the CO chemisorption, it only provided a value for Pt/Al2O3. The effect of metal dispersion on coke combustion will be mentioned in further discussion.

The solid vertical lines are characteristic peaks of cubic ceria Full size image However, the individual metal oxide phase of MgO (PDF No. 00-045-0946), CeO2 (PDF No. 00-034-0394), and ZrO2 (PDF No. 00-037-1484) was verified over calcined Pt/MgO, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, respectively. As observed in previous literature [24], the phase of Al2O3 is the gamma phase, while SBA-15 is considered an amorphous phase. Figure 2f shows that the presence of zirconium makes the 2θ of CeO2 shift to higher values; this shift indicates a change in the lattice parameter of the CeO2 or that cerium oxide and zirconium oxide form a solid solution [25]. However, CeO2 and ZrO2 were not combined completely because there was still a separate tetragonal ZrO2 phase.
Fig. 2 TGA profiles of coke combustion with various heating rates over the spent catalysts Full size image In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X 0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%. Final propane conversions (X f) of all catalysts were less than 7%, implying fast catalyst deactivation. The coke weight percentage generated during propane dehydrogenation ranged from 2.3 to 9.7. The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction.
3.2 Coke Combustion
Figure 2 presents the TGA patterns of coke combustion over each spent catalyst with different heating rates. The combustion temperatures corresponding to the conversions of half of the coke in the spent catalyst (denoted as T 50%) are listed in Table 2. The combustion temperatures of coke over all catalysts increased progressively with increasing heating rate. Among the catalysts, the reactivity of coke combustion over Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 was the best because of the lowest combustion temperature.
Table 2 Oxidation temperature at 50% conversion (T 50%) versus various heating rates Full size table Figure 3 shows the Ozawa plots for 50% coke burn off, and the activation energies of coke combustion acquired from the plots are summarized in Table 1. The combustion temperatures of coke and activation energies decreased significantly following the order: Pt/SBA-15 > Pt/Al2O3 > Pt/MgO > Pt/CeO2 > Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2. This order well matches the trend in the relative oxygen mobilities (ROM) of supports quoted from previous literature (Table 1) [26, 27]. In CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, there are two types of mobility: surface and bulk oxygen mobility. The activated oxygen spilled over metal particles takes part in surface migration and exchange with lattice oxygen of the support. However, we considered that coke deposited on the surface of catalysts; therefore, the surface phenomena was heavily focused in our study to understand the combustion of coke by the activated oxygen on the surface. In the literature [27, 28], the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 was higher than that of CeO2 and oxygen surface mobility was proportional to OSC. Therefore, we listed the order of ROM over the catalysts as shown in Table 1. The ROM versus T 50% plotted in Fig. 4 clearly shows the relationship between the two parameters. The determination coefficient (R 2) for the relationship was 0.98, indicating a strong linear relationship. The strong relationship confirms that the oxygen mobility over the supports is a key variable that remarkably influences the coke combustion temperature; the higher oxygen mobility over the support leads to a lower coke combustion temperature during the catalyst regeneration.

The oxygen mobility of Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 extrapolated from a linear fit Full size image The intrinsic combustion reactivity of coke is only dependent on its structure; the polyaromatic structures (low H/C ratio) have a higher combustion temperature than aliphatic structures (higher H/C ratio) [29, 30]. Furthermore, the coke located on the Pt has a lower combustion temperature than that on the support because of the catalytic effect of the Pt sites. In our previous report [18, 31], 13C CP/MAS NMR, XRD and TPO techniques were used to demonstrate that the coke structure was independent of the nature of supports in propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalysts at 600. The coke was located mainly on the supports in our experiment because at least two spent catalysts should have similar combustion temperatures if the coke is located on Pt sites. To support this hypothesis, a reaction test for the Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst was performed where CeO2Al2O3 is a cerium doped-Al2O3 support and a TGA profile (heating rate = 40 C/min) of coke combustion was acquired (Fig. 5a). The coke combustion profile over the Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst consisted of two distinct peaks that well matched the coke combustion peak over Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Al2O3. This is strong evidence that coke was mainly located on the supports. The influence of Pt dispersion on coke combustion was also ruled out. Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt loadings (0.5, 2.0, and 3.0 wt%) were prepared and TGA profiles were obtained (Fig. 5b). The combustion temperatures of coke over different Pt loading catalysts were nearly the same with insignificant tolerance.
Fig. 5 TGA profiles of coke combustion over a Pt/CeO2Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CeO2 and b Pt/Al2O3 with different Pt loadings Full size image The oxygen mobility over supports is likely an important factor in coke combustion. It was postulated that the spillover of activated oxygen from Pt to the support promotes the oxidation of graphitic carbon on the support [32]. The mechanism of coke combustion is shown in Fig. 6. The activated oxygen should be diffused to coke on the support in order to burn it off. The strong relationship between the oxygen mobility over supports and T 50% suggests that the surface migration of the activated oxygen is a rate-determining step for the coke combustion process. A similar phenomenon was observed in previous literature [33, 34]. When authors regenerated HY zeolites (with various ratios of Si to Al) that deactivated under propene conversion [33] and HZSM-5 and USY catalysts under LDPE cracking [34], zeolite with a higher ratio of Si to Al exhibited higher coke combustion temperatures.
Fig. 6 Mechanism of oxygen spillover and mobility on support during coke combustion Full size image 4 Conclusions In conclusion, by preparing Pt over various supports with different oxygen mobility, a support with higher oxygen mobility was demonstrated with lower oxidation temperature during regeneration of spent catalysts. A temperature difference of 250 C can be achieved between Pt/SBA-15 (lowest oxygen mobility) and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 (highest oxygen mobility).

The various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by affecting the oxygen mobility over the support. Higher oxygen mobility leads to lower oxidation temperatures during catalyst regeneration, resulting in improved coke combustion efficiency. This is evidenced by the strong correlation between the oxygen mobility of the supports and the combustion temperature of the coke, with the combustion temperatures increasing in the reverse order of oxygen mobility: CeZrO2 > CeO2 > MgO > Al2O3 > SBA-15. The oxygen mobility over supports acts as a rate-determining step in the coke combustion process, facilitating the surface migration of activated oxygen from the Pt to the support, which promotes the oxidation of graphitic carbon on the support. This finding underscores the importance of optimizing support materials with high oxygen mobility for enhancing PDH catalyst performance and reducing the need for frequent regeneration processes.
