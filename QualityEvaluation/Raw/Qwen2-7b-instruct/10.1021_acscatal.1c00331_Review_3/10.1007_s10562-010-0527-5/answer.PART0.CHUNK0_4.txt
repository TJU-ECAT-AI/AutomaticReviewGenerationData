[1] "Five supported Pt catalysts (Pt/SBA-15, Pt/Al2O3, Pt/MgO, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2) were prepared to systematically investigate the influence of oxygen mobility over the support on combustion temperatures of coke produced in propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "A strong correlation between the oxygen mobility of the supports and the combustion temperature of the coke was observed."
[3] "The coke combustion temperatures increased following the reverse order of oxygen mobility of the supports: CeZrO2 > CeO2 > MgO > Al2O3 > SBA-15, implying that the oxygen transfer over supports was a rate-determining step in the coke combustion process."
[4] "The oxygen mobility over supports is likely an important factor in coke combustion. It was postulated that the spillover of activated oxygen from Pt to the support promotes the oxidation of graphitic carbon on the support."

The pore structures of catalyst supports, including their pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These characteristics influence the efficiency of the catalytic conversion process and the extent of coke deposition. Specifically, supports with higher oxygen mobility lead to lower coke combustion temperatures, which in turn reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation and extends the operational life of the catalyst. The strong correlation between oxygen mobility and coke combustion temperature highlights the importance of optimizing support materials to minimize coke formation and improve PDH catalyst performance.

催化剂支撑孔结构，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭的形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能有显著影响。这些特征影响催化转化过程的效率和焦炭沉积的程度。具体而言，具有更高氧活性的支撑材料导致较低的焦炭燃烧温度，从而降低了催化剂失活的速度并延长了催化剂的使用寿命。氧移动性的强相关性与焦炭燃烧温度之间的关系强调了优化支撑材料以减少焦炭形成并提高PDH催化剂性能的重要性。
