[1] "Various commercial catalysts have been developed for propane dehydrogenation: chromia-alumina (ABB Lummus Global), Pt/alumina with alkali, Cu, and Zn used as promoters (UOP LLC), and Pt/zinc aluminate with Sn used as a promoter (Phillips Petroleum) [3]."
[2] "Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2. The temperature required to gasify the carbon deposits at a reasonable rate varies with the type of gas, the structure and reactivity of the coke, and the activity of the catalyst."

[6] "The coke located on the Pt has a lower combustion temperature than that on the support because of the catalytic effect of the Pt sites."

The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature highlights that the pore structure of the support determines the space available for coke formation and the ease of coke removal during the regeneration process. Pore size, connectivity, and uniformity impact how effectively coke can be accommodated and subsequently combusted. Hierarchical pore structures, with their combination of macropores, mesopores, and micropores, facilitate better diffusion and access of reactants and products, thus influencing the PDH reaction efficiency and coke deposition. The connectivity and uniformity of the pore structure affect the catalyst's accessibility to reactants and products, impacting the overall catalytic performance. These relationships suggest that designing catalysts with optimized pore structures can enhance PDH reaction efficiency, reduce coke formation, and improve catalyst longevity.

The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts are profound. Catalysts with controlled pore structures, particularly those that balance pore size, connectivity, and uniformity, can be tailored to match specific PDH reaction requirements. For instance, supports with larger pores may promote faster diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the PDH reaction rate. Meanwhile, smaller pores can limit coke formation by restricting the space available for coke deposition. Hierarchical pore structures enable a balance between fast diffusion and coke suppression, potentially leading to improved catalyst performance and stability. By carefully engineering the pore structure of the support, it is possible to design catalysts that efficiently handle PDH reactions, minimize coke formation, and extend catalyst life.

Moreover, the literature emphasizes the importance of considering the catalyst's support material's inherent properties, such as oxygen mobility. Supports with higher oxygen mobility facilitate better oxygen transfer, which can lead to more efficient coke combustion during the regeneration process. This characteristic can significantly impact catalyst performance, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of sintering and maintaining high catalytic activity even after multiple regeneration cycles. By integrating knowledge of pore structure and oxygen mobility, researchers and engineers can develop catalysts that are not only highly active in PDH reactions but also robust against deactivation due to coke formation, thereby optimizing both reaction efficiency and catalyst longevity.

催化剂支撑结构特性，包括孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，显著影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭的形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。文献指出，支撑结构决定了焦炭形成的空隙以及合理速率下去除碳沉积物的能力。孔径大小、连通性和均匀性影响焦炭的容纳和燃烧效率。层次孔结构，结合微孔、介孔和宏观孔，有利于反应物和产物的扩散，从而影响PDH反应效率和焦炭沉积。连通性和均匀性影响催化剂对反应物和产物的可接近性，进而影响整体催化性能。这些关系表明，根据特定PDH反应要求设计优化的支撑结构可以提高反应效率、减少焦炭形成并延长催化剂寿命。

这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义深远。通过控制支撑结构，尤其是平衡孔径大小、连通性和均匀性，可以定制催化剂以满足PDH反应需求。例如，具有较大孔径的支撑可能促进反应物和产物的快速扩散，增强PDH反应速率。同时，较小的孔径可以限制焦炭形成，因为它限制了焦炭沉积的空间。层次孔结构允许在快速扩散和焦炭抑制之间达到平衡，可能有助于提高催化剂性能和稳定性。通过精心设计支撑结构，有可能开发出既能高效处理PDH反应、又能有效抑制焦炭形成、并延长催化剂使用寿命的催化剂。

此外，文献强调了考虑催化剂支撑材料固有性质的重要性，如氧流动性。具有更高氧流动性的支撑促进更好的氧传输，这可以导致更有效的焦炭燃烧过程。这一特性对催化剂性能的影响尤其重要，尤其是在降低热热点或过热的风险方面，这些风险可能导致活性相熔化和反应设备损坏。通过整合对支撑结构和氧流动性的知识，研究人员和工程师可以开发出既在PDH反应中高度活跃又在去活过程中抵抗焦炭形成、保持高催化活性的催化剂，从而优化反应效率和催化剂寿命。
