How do various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts?

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures play crucial roles in coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions. Pore size affects performance, with smaller pores typically showing better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts. Pore uniformity, connectivity, and hierarchical arrangements also impact coke formation, with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores facilitating more coke accommodation. These characteristics are pivotal in designing catalysts that minimize coke formation and maintain optimal performance.

Single atom/site and confined cluster strategies offer effective ways to curb coke formation. Single Pt atoms exhibit good resistance to coke formation due to their ability to reduce the binding energy of propene, promoting its desorption and preventing further dehydrogenation. Confined Pt clusters within zeolites demonstrate remarkable stability and excellent resistance to coke formation, thanks to the unique interactions between Pt and the zeolite support.

Regeneration of catalysts involves burning coke with oxidants, but this process can be challenging, especially when catalyst performance improvements lead to more difficult coke removal. Support engineering can tune the burning temperature of coke, but it may also cause Pt sintering, necessitating further oxychlorination to maintain high dispersion of Pt.

The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts are significant. By understanding how pore structures influence coke formation and performance, researchers can tailor catalyst supports to minimize coke buildup and enhance overall efficiency. Strategies like single atom/site and confined cluster designs offer promising avenues for reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability. Regeneration techniques must be carefully managed to balance coke removal and minimize catalyst degradation.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能？这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义是什么？

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性在PDH反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能具有关键作用。孔径影响性能，较小的孔通常显示出更好的选择性、稳定性和较低的焦炭量。孔的均匀性、连通性和层次结构也影响焦炭形成，更均匀、高度连通和较大的孔有助于更多焦炭的容纳。这些特性对于设计减少焦炭形成并保持最佳性能的催化剂至关重要。

单个原子/位点和受限簇策略提供了有效抑制焦炭形成的方法。单个Pt原子表现出良好的焦炭抵抗性，由于其能够降低丙烯的结合能，促进其脱附并防止进一步的脱氢，从而减少焦炭形成。受限在沸石内的Pt簇显示出非凡的稳定性以及对焦炭形成的出色抵抗性，这得益于Pt与沸石支撑的独特相互作用。

通过燃烧焦炭与氧化剂再生催化剂，但这个过程可能具有挑战性，特别是当催化剂性能改进导致焦炭去除更加困难时。支持工程可以调节焦炭的燃烧温度，但也可能导致Pt烧结，需要进一步的氧氯化来维持Pt的高度分散。

这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义非常重要。通过了解孔结构如何影响焦炭形成和性能，研究人员可以根据减少焦炭沉积和提高总体效率的需要定制催化剂支撑。单个原子/位点和受限簇设计提供了减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性的有前景的途径。再生技术必须谨慎管理，以平衡焦炭去除和减少催化剂降解。

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Decreased acidity due to modified pore structure, such as introducing hierarchical pores in ZSM-5, can inhibit coke formation on the metal and enhance the support's coke capacity. 

New strategies involving single atom/site and confined cluster designs aim to effectively curb coke formation. For instance, single atom sites, like a Pt/Cu single atom alloy supported on γ-alumina, offer good activity and stability. Similarly, confined Pt clusters, especially within zeolites, demonstrate unique geometrical and electronic properties that stabilize the metal cluster and minimize coke formation. 

Regeneration of coke-covered catalysts requires careful consideration, as the introduction of elements like Sn can cause coke transfer from active sites to the support, making regeneration more challenging. Support engineering plays a vital role in tuning the burning temperature of coke, affecting both efficiency and potential sintering of the active component. 

These findings suggest that optimizing catalyst support pore structures and employing innovative catalyst designs can significantly reduce coke formation and improve overall PDH performance, contributing to more efficient and sustainable processes.

各种催化剂支持孔结构特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构排列，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能具有重要影响。通过引入层级孔隙结构来调整ZSM-5的孔结构可以降低支撑材料的酸度，从而抑制金属上的焦炭形成并提高支撑材料的焦炭容量。

新策略包括单原子/位点和受限簇设计，旨在有效遏制焦炭形成。例如，单原子位点，如γ-Al2O3上支持的Pt/Cu单原子合金，不仅表现出良好的活性和稳定性。同样，受限在沸石中的Pt簇，特别是那些在硅铝沸石（SiO2）中的簇，展现出独特的几何和电子性质，能够稳定金属簇并最小化焦炭形成。

催化剂再生需要仔细考虑，因为添加元素如Sn可能导致焦炭从活性位点转移到支撑材料上，使再生变得更加困难。支撑工程对于调节焦炭燃烧温度至关重要，这既影响效率也可能会导致活性成分的烧结。

这些发现表明，优化催化剂支持孔结构和采用创新的催化剂设计可以显著减少焦炭形成并提高整体PDH性能，有助于更高效、更可持续的过程。
