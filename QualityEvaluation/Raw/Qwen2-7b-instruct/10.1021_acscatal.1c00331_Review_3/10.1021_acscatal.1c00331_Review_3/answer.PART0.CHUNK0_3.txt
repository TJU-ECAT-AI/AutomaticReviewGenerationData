Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Decreased acidity due to modified pore structure, such as introducing hierarchical pores in ZSM-5, can inhibit coke formation on the metal and enhance the support's coke capacity. 

New strategies involving single atom/site and confined cluster designs aim to effectively curb coke formation. For instance, single atom sites, like a Pt/Cu single atom alloy supported on γ-alumina, offer good activity and stability. Similarly, confined Pt clusters, especially within zeolites, demonstrate unique geometrical and electronic properties that stabilize the metal cluster and minimize coke formation. 

Regeneration of coke-covered catalysts requires careful consideration, as the introduction of elements like Sn can cause coke transfer from active sites to the support, making regeneration more challenging. Support engineering plays a vital role in tuning the burning temperature of coke, affecting both efficiency and potential sintering of the active component. 

These findings suggest that optimizing catalyst support pore structures and employing innovative catalyst designs can significantly reduce coke formation and improve overall PDH performance, contributing to more efficient and sustainable processes.

各种催化剂支持孔结构特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构排列，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能具有重要影响。通过引入层级孔隙结构来调整ZSM-5的孔结构可以降低支撑材料的酸度，从而抑制金属上的焦炭形成并提高支撑材料的焦炭容量。

新策略包括单原子/位点和受限簇设计，旨在有效遏制焦炭形成。例如，单原子位点，如γ-Al2O3上支持的Pt/Cu单原子合金，不仅表现出良好的活性和稳定性。同样，受限在沸石中的Pt簇，特别是那些在硅铝沸石（SiO2）中的簇，展现出独特的几何和电子性质，能够稳定金属簇并最小化焦炭形成。

催化剂再生需要仔细考虑，因为添加元素如Sn可能导致焦炭从活性位点转移到支撑材料上，使再生变得更加困难。支撑工程对于调节焦炭燃烧温度至关重要，这既影响效率也可能会导致活性成分的烧结。

这些发现表明，优化催化剂支持孔结构和采用创新的催化剂设计可以显著减少焦炭形成并提高整体PDH性能，有助于更高效、更可持续的过程。
