[1] "The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation."
[2] "Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support."
[3] "A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes."
[4] "Sun et al. successfully synthesized a Pt/Cu single atom alloy supported on γ-alumina and applied in propane direct dehydrogenation."
[5] "They found that the catalyst delivered the propylene selectivity of 90% with the formation rate of 10.6 mol·gPt1·h1 at 520 C."
[6] "The success of the catalysts was concluded from the breaking of the scaling relation between the CH bond activation energy and propene adsorption."
[7] "In contrast, there are barely cokes found on 0.1 wt % loading Pt, which is corresponding to an atomic dispersed catalyst."
[8] "Single Pt atom has a good balance between dehydrogenation activity and coke regulation."
[9] "The application of single atom/site not only significantly reduce the coke formation but also create a new direction to optimize PDH performance."
[10] "Recently, Cormas group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH."
[11] "Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite."
[12] "Under the real industrial condition, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst showed an initial propane conversion of 20% at 550 C and an initial selectivity to 97% propylene."
[13] "The confined PtLa/Y cluster exhibited remarkable stability in PDH."
[14] "The synthesis of PtLa/Y cluster with 3 nm diameter uniformly distributed within zeolite."
[15] "The confined PtLa/Y cluster exhibited remarkable stability in PDH."
[16] "Overall, the mesoporous structure of zeolite yields a confined space for Pt-based cluster, and the unique interactions between them are accountable for the observed activity and stability."
[17] "The main method to regenerate the coke-covered catalyst is to burn coke with oxidant."
[18] "A low burning temperature means low energy consumption and cost."
[19] "The oxidation temperature of coke on several supports is Pt/CeZrO2 < Pt/CeO2 < Pt/MgO < Pt/Al2O3 < Pt/SBA-15."

1. The pore structure of the support plays a crucial role in coke formation during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements influence the accommodation of coke, affecting overall catalyst performance.

2. Catalysts with smaller pores show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke formation compared to those with larger pores. Uniformity and connectivity of the pores contribute to higher coke accommodation.

3. Single atom catalysts demonstrate a good balance between dehydrogenation activity and coke regulation. The Pt/Cu single atom alloy on γ-alumina provides high propylene selectivity with a low formation rate.

4. Atomic dispersed catalysts, with a loading of 0.1 wt % Pt, exhibit minimal coke formation, indicating their efficiency in balancing activity and coke suppression.

5. Single atom sites, such as the Pt/Cu alloy, offer improved stability and resistance to coke formation, creating a new direction for optimizing PDH performance.

6. Cluster catalysts, particularly those confined in zeolite, show remarkable stability and activity. The region-selective deposition of PtSn clusters within zeolite leads to enhanced stability and low coke formation.

7. Zeolite supports with mesoporous structures yield confined spaces for Pt-based clusters, facilitating unique interactions that contribute to observed activity and stability.

8. Regeneration of coke-covered catalysts through burning with oxidants requires careful control of the burning temperature to balance energy consumption, cost, and the risk of sintering the active components.

1. 支持的孔结构在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成中起着关键作用。孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响焦炭的容纳，从而影响催化剂的整体性能。

2. 小孔径催化剂表现出更好的选择性、稳定性，并且具有较低的焦炭形成率，与大孔径相比。孔的均匀性和连通性有助于更高的焦炭容纳。

3. 单原子催化剂在平衡脱氢活性和焦炭抑制方面表现出良好的平衡。γ-Al2O3上的Pt/Cu单原子合金提供高丙烯选择性，形成速率低。

4. 重量百分比为0.1的Pt的原子分散催化剂显示出最小的焦炭形成，表明它们在平衡活性和焦炭抑制方面的效率。

5. 单原子位点，如Pt/Cu合金，提供了改善稳定性和抵抗焦炭形成的性能，开辟了优化PDH性能的新方向。

6. 位于沸石内的PtSn簇催化剂显示出非凡的稳定性和活性。沸石内选择性沉积的PtSn簇导致稳定性提高并减少焦炭形成。

7. 具有介孔结构的沸石支持了Pt基簇的受限空间，促进了独特的相互作用，这些相互作用对观察到的活性和稳定性做出了贡献。

8. 通过氧化去除覆盖催化剂的焦炭需要仔细控制燃烧温度来平衡能源消耗、成本和活性成分的烧结风险。
