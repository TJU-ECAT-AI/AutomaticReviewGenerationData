The pore structure of the support plays a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangement of the pores determine how well the catalyst can manage coke formation. Smaller pore sizes lead to better selectivity and stability, reducing coke formation. Uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores facilitate more efficient coke accommodation, enhancing catalyst performance. The use of single atom/site catalysts, such as [PtZn4], demonstrates superior coke regulation compared to conventional catalysts. Confined Pt clusters within zeolite offer enhanced stability and resistance to coke formation due to their specific geometric and electronic properties. Support engineering techniques, like modifying the pore structure, can adjust the burning temperature of coke, impacting catalyst regeneration. The mobility of activated oxygen species on the support influences coke burning efficiency, affecting catalyst stability during regeneration. To maintain high dispersion of Pt, additional treatments like oxychlorination may be necessary.
