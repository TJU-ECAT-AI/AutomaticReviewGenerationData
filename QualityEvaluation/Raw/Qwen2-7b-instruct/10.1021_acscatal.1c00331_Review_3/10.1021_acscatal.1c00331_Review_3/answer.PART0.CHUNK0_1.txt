3.3.2. Pore Structure
"The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation."
"Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support."
"A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes."

3.4. New Strategy: Single Atom/Site and Confined Cluster
"In recent days, the new strategies of catalysts design in PDH are proposed and verified to effectively curb coke formation."

3.4.1. Single Atom/Site
"Sun et al. successfully synthesized a Pt/Cu single atom alloy supported on γ-alumina and applied in propane direct dehydrogenation."
"Chen et al. successfully synthesized a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst."
"A single Pt site also possessed good resistance to coke formation."

3.4.2. Confined Pt Cluster
"Recently, Cormas group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH."
"Ryoo et al. used a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects as PDH catalyst support."

3.5. Regeneration of Catalyst
"Although the prevention of coke formation achieved impressive progress, the coke deposition is still unavoidable in PDH. Thus, it is mandatory to periodically regenerate the catalyst in industry."

1. The pore structure of the support significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. Smaller pore sizes lead to better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amounts. Supports with more uniform, interconnected, and larger pores can accommodate more cokes. 

2. New strategies focusing on single atom/site and confined cluster designs effectively mitigate coke formation in PDH processes.

3. Single atom sites, especially when Pt is surrounded by inert Cu or Zn, offer good balance between dehydrogenation activity and coke regulation. Single-site [PtZn4] catalysts exhibit excellent stability without significant deactivation during prolonged testing.

4. Confined Pt clusters within zeolite provide good stability and resistance to coke formation due to their unique interactions with the zeolite structure. The presence of rare earth elements like La and Y enhances stability and reduces coke formation.

5. Regeneration of coke-covered catalysts is crucial but challenging. Sn addition may transfer coke from active sites to the support, making it harder to remove. Support engineering can tune the burning temperature of coke, affecting both catalyst regeneration efficiency and Pt sintering.

1. 支持的孔结构显著影响焦油形成、容纳和PDH反应中的催化剂性能。较小的孔径导致更好的选择性、稳定性和较低的焦油量。具有更均匀、互联和更大孔径的支持可以容纳更多的焦油。

2. 针对单个原子/位点和受限簇的新策略有效地抑制了PDH过程中的焦油形成。

3. 特别是当Pt被惰性Cu或Zn包围时，单个原子位点提供良好的平衡，以调节脱氢活性和焦油形成。单个位点[PtZn4]催化剂在长时间测试中表现出极佳的稳定性，没有明显的失活。

4. 在沸石内受限的Pt簇提供了良好的稳定性和抗焦油形成能力，由于它们与沸石结构的独特相互作用。镧和Y等稀土元素的存在增强了稳定性并减少了焦油形成。

5. 催化剂的再生对于去除覆盖的焦油至关重要但具有挑战性。添加Sn可能会将焦油从活性位点转移到支持物上，使其更难移除。支持工程可以调整焦油的燃烧温度，影响催化剂再生效率和Pt聚集。
