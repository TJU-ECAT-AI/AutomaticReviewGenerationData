[1] "The process of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very complex. Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."
[2] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
[3] "A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."
[4] "Finally, coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

The pore network structure of the catalyst significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Non-uniform coke distribution depends on the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements within the catalyst support. Pore narrowing and plugging lead to decreased diffusion rates and accessibility of active sites, causing deactivation. Percolation phenomena reduce the effective surface area available for reactions. These complexities necessitate the use of accurate models to predict and optimize the catalyst design.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Non-uniform distribution of coke within the catalyst particle is greatly affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions. Large pores can become inaccessible due to surrounding plugged pores, further complicating the coking process. When the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, a percolation phenomenon occurs, disconnecting the particle-spanning cluster of open pores. Coke deactivation in catalyst particles is not limited to covering active sites but also involves increasing diffusion resistance and making active sites inaccessible due to coke narrowing and plugging pores. These relationships have significant implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts.

催化剂支撑孔结构的特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有着重要影响。焦炭在催化剂颗粒中的非均匀分布很大程度上受到孔网络结构和反应条件的影响。大的孔可能因周围堵塞的孔而变得不可访问，进一步复杂化了焦炭形成过程。当开放孔的比例低于临界阈值时，会发生渗透现象，切断开放孔的粒子贯穿簇。焦炭在催化剂颗粒中的失活不仅限于覆盖活性位点，还包括由于焦炭狭窄和堵塞孔道导致的扩散阻力增加和活性位点不可达。这些关系对于设计高效催化剂具有重要意义。

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors determine how effectively the catalyst can handle coke, affecting its deactivation and productivity. Specifically, non-uniform pore size and distribution can lead to uneven coke accumulation, impacting the catalyst's performance. Connectivity influences the accessibility of reactants and products, affecting both the rate of coking and deactivation. Uniformity ensures consistent reaction rates across the catalyst, reducing variability in performance. Hierarchical arrangements can optimize the balance between active sites and pore space, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include considering the pore structure during synthesis, tailoring pore sizes for specific reactants, and optimizing pore connectivity and uniformity to maximize activity while minimizing deactivation. This understanding guides the selection of materials and synthesis methods to create catalysts with improved stability and selectivity in PDH reactions.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These structures determine how coke is distributed within the catalyst particle, affecting its capacity to accommodate coke and its overall performance. The nonuniform distribution of coke, influenced by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leads to complex interactions that can hinder reactant access and reduce activity. The percolation phenomenon, where the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, further complicates the situation by disconnecting previously connected clusters of open pores, impacting flow and heat transfer. Additionally, coke not only covers active sites but also narrows and plugs pores, increasing diffusion resistance and making active sites inaccessible. These factors collectively determine the capacity of a catalyst particle to accommodate coke and correlate with the apparent reaction rate, reflecting the deactivation process.

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, non-uniform coke distribution influenced by pore network structure and reaction conditions complicates the coking process. Large pores being surrounded by plugged pores and becoming inaccessible to reactants add to this complexity. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores falls below a critical threshold, affecting catalyst performance. Coke deactivation is not solely due to covering active sites but also involves increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores. A proper mathematical model is necessary to understand these particle-level phenomena.

The dimensionless coke content in the catalyst particle (Wc) can be calculated to reflect the capacity of a catalyst particle to accommodate coke. The apparent reaction rate for propane dehydrogenation (Rapp) decreases with time, indicating the deactivation process. Rapp also correlates with Wc, providing insight into the relationship between deactivation and coking.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能起着关键作用。具体而言，由孔网络结构和反应条件影响的非均匀焦炭分布复杂了焦化过程。大孔被堵塞孔包围并变得无法接触反应物进一步增加了这一复杂性。当未打开或开放孔的比例低于临界阈值时，会发生渗透现象，这影响了催化剂的性能。焦炭去活不仅通过覆盖活性位点，而且还涉及随着焦炭变窄和堵塞孔道增加扩散阻力和难以接近的活性位点。需要适当的数学模型来理解这些颗粒级现象。

可以通过计算催化剂颗粒中无量纲焦炭含量（Wc）来反映颗粒容纳焦炭的能力。丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的显式反应速率（Rapp）随时间减少，表明去活过程。Rapp与Wc之间存在相关性，提供了焦炭形成和去活关系的见解。
