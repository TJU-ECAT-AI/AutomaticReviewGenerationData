[1] "Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."
[2] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
[3] "A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."
[4] "Finally, coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These structures determine how coke is distributed within the catalyst particle, affecting its capacity to accommodate coke and its overall performance. The nonuniform distribution of coke, influenced by the pore network structure and reaction conditions, leads to complex interactions that can hinder reactant access and reduce activity. The percolation phenomenon, where the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, further complicates the situation by disconnecting previously connected clusters of open pores, impacting flow and heat transfer. Additionally, coke not only covers active sites but also narrows and plugs pores, increasing diffusion resistance and making active sites inaccessible. These factors collectively determine the capacity of a catalyst particle to accommodate coke and correlate with the apparent reaction rate, reflecting the deactivation process.

催化剂支撑孔结构特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。这些结构决定了焦炭在催化剂颗粒内的分布方式，影响其容纳焦炭的能力以及整体性能。非均匀的焦炭分布受到孔网络结构和反应条件的影响，导致复杂的相互作用，妨碍了反应物的接近并降低了活性。渗透现象的发生，即开放孔隙的比例降至临界阈值以下，进一步增加了复杂性，使之前连接的开放孔隙簇断开，影响了流动和热传递。此外，焦炭不仅覆盖活性位点，还会缩小并堵塞孔隙，增加扩散阻力并使活性位点变得不可访问。这些因素共同决定了催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力，并与显反应速率相关联，反映了脱活过程。
