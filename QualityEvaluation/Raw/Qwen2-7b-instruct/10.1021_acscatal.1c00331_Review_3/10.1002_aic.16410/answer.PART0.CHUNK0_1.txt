[1] "Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."
[2] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
[3] "A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."
[4] "Finally, coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Non-uniform distribution of coke within the catalyst particle is greatly affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions. Large pores can become inaccessible due to surrounding plugged pores, further complicating the coking process. When the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, a percolation phenomenon occurs, disconnecting the particle-spanning cluster of open pores. Coke deactivation in catalyst particles is not limited to covering active sites but also involves increasing diffusion resistance and making active sites inaccessible due to coke narrowing and plugging pores. These relationships have significant implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts.

催化剂支撑孔结构的特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有着重要影响。焦炭在催化剂颗粒中的非均匀分布很大程度上受到孔网络结构和反应条件的影响。大的孔可能因周围堵塞的孔而变得不可访问，进一步复杂化了焦炭形成过程。当开放孔的比例低于临界阈值时，会发生渗透现象，切断开放孔的粒子贯穿簇。焦炭在催化剂颗粒中的失活不仅限于覆盖活性位点，还包括由于焦炭狭窄和堵塞孔道导致的扩散阻力增加和活性位点不可达。这些关系对于设计高效催化剂具有重要意义。
