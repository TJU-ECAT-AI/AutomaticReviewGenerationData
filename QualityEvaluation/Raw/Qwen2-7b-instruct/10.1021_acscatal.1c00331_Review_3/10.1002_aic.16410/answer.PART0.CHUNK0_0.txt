[1] "The process of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very complex. Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."
[2] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
[3] "A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."
[4] "Finally, coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

The pore network structure of the catalyst significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Non-uniform coke distribution depends on the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements within the catalyst support. Pore narrowing and plugging lead to decreased diffusion rates and accessibility of active sites, causing deactivation. Percolation phenomena reduce the effective surface area available for reactions. These complexities necessitate the use of accurate models to predict and optimize the catalyst design.

催化剂的孔网络结构显著影响焦炭形成、容纳和丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的整体性能。焦炭的非均匀分布依赖于催化剂支持中的孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构。孔缩小和堵塞导致扩散率降低和活性位点的可及性减少，从而引起失活。渗透现象减少了可用于反应的有效表面积。这些复杂性需要准确的模型来预测和优化催化剂设计。
