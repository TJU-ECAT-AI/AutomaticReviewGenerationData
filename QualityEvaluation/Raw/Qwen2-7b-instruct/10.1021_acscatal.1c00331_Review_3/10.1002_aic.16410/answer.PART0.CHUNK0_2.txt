[1] "The process of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very complex."
[2] "Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."
[3] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
[4] "A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."
[5] "Finally, coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."
[6] "Considering the above complications, a proper mathematical model is needed to probe coking and deactivation at the particle level, which is what this article sets out to do."
[7] "Pore network The pore space of a catalyst particle is represented by the pore network within a two-dimensional disc domain, as illustrated in Figure 1."
[8] "The method for generating the pore network is adopted from the work by Ye et al.,40 in which more details of this method are given."
[9] "Diffusion and reaction In the pore network, the process of diffusion and main reaction can be mathematically described using different equations in pore channels and nodes."
[10] "Coking and deactivation In the pore network, coking and deactivation occur simultaneously; they affect each other in three ways, namely, through site coverage, pore narrowing, and pore blockage."
[11] "When assuming that the coke formation reaction and main reaction occur by a single site mechanism on the same active sites, and coke uniformly deactivates these active sites, the relation between coke loading and activity can be described by8,32,52."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors determine how effectively the catalyst can handle coke, affecting its deactivation and productivity. Specifically, non-uniform pore size and distribution can lead to uneven coke accumulation, impacting the catalyst's performance. Connectivity influences the accessibility of reactants and products, affecting both the rate of coking and deactivation. Uniformity ensures consistent reaction rates across the catalyst, reducing variability in performance. Hierarchical arrangements can optimize the balance between active sites and pore space, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include considering the pore structure during synthesis, tailoring pore sizes for specific reactants, and optimizing pore connectivity and uniformity to maximize activity while minimizing deactivation. This understanding guides the selection of materials and synthesis methods to create catalysts with improved stability and selectivity in PDH reactions.
