Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, non-uniform coke distribution influenced by pore network structure and reaction conditions complicates the coking process. Large pores being surrounded by plugged pores and becoming inaccessible to reactants add to this complexity. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores falls below a critical threshold, affecting catalyst performance. Coke deactivation is not solely due to covering active sites but also involves increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores. A proper mathematical model is necessary to understand these particle-level phenomena.

The dimensionless coke content in the catalyst particle (Wc) can be calculated to reflect the capacity of a catalyst particle to accommodate coke. The apparent reaction rate for propane dehydrogenation (Rapp) decreases with time, indicating the deactivation process. Rapp also correlates with Wc, providing insight into the relationship between deactivation and coking.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能起着关键作用。具体而言，由孔网络结构和反应条件影响的非均匀焦炭分布复杂了焦化过程。大孔被堵塞孔包围并变得无法接触反应物进一步增加了这一复杂性。当未打开或开放孔的比例低于临界阈值时，会发生渗透现象，这影响了催化剂的性能。焦炭去活不仅通过覆盖活性位点，而且还涉及随着焦炭变窄和堵塞孔道增加扩散阻力和难以接近的活性位点。需要适当的数学模型来理解这些颗粒级现象。

可以通过计算催化剂颗粒中无量纲焦炭含量（Wc）来反映颗粒容纳焦炭的能力。丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的显式反应速率（Rapp）随时间减少，表明去活过程。Rapp与Wc之间存在相关性，提供了焦炭形成和去活关系的见解。
