[1] "Hierarchical-pores are directly introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite. This new zeolite was used as a support for PtSnNa-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
[3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
[4] "By using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
[5] "The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ not only modified the textual properties but also influenced the acid content of zeolite."
[6] "Moreover, the weakened acid sites and existence of oxide Sn in ZQ suppressed the coke precursor forming on the metal and even facilitated migration of the coke precursor to the external surface of the support."
[7] "From TPO analysis, the carbon deposits on the metallic surface of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst were strongly decreased, implying that Pt particles which located in the hierarchical-pores could avoid the rapid cover by carbon deposits."
[8] "Based on these results, in comparison with traditional ZSM-5 zeolite, PtSnNa/ZQ possessed better propane conversion and greater stability of the catalyst."

1. The introduction of hierarchical-pores into ZSM-5 zeolite enhances its capacity to accommodate coke, leading to improved catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The coke deposits migrate from the active metal surface to the support, improving the overall stability of the catalyst.

2. The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and the overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Hierarchical-pores in the support material facilitate the migration of coke precursor from the active metal surface to the external surface of the support, reducing coke formation on the active metal.

3. The design of optimal and effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation involves controlling the pore size distribution of hierarchical-pores within the zeolite support. This allows for better transport of reactant and product molecules, improves catalytic activity, and stability by inhibiting the further agglomeration of metal particles during the reaction process. The weakened acidity of the support also contributes to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction.

4. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include the strategic modification of zeolite supports to incorporate hierarchical-pores. This strategy enhances the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke, reduces coke formation on the active metal, and promotes the stability of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. 催化剂支持孔结构特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，对丙烷裂解反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。层级孔结构在支撑材料中促进了焦炭前驱体从活性金属表面向支撑体外部表面的迁移，减少了活性金属上的焦炭形成。

3. 设计最佳和有效催化剂以进行丙烷裂解反应涉及控制层级孔结构在沸石支持物中的孔尺寸分布。这允许更好地传输反应物和产物分子，提高了催化活性和稳定性，并通过抑制反应过程中金属颗粒的进一步聚集来促进催化剂稳定性。支撑体的弱酸性也有助于降低反应过程中的焦炭形成速率。

The pore structures of catalyst support materials, specifically pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Hierarchical-pores, when introduced into the zeolite structure, notably enhance the capacity to accommodate coke by altering the textural properties and reducing acid content. This results in a shift of coke deposits from the active metal surface to the support surface. The enhanced accommodation of coke and the suppression of coke formation on the metal surface contribute to improved catalytic performance, particularly in terms of propane conversion and stability. Moreover, the existence of more oxide forms of tin facilitates anchoring on the catalyst surface, inhibiting further agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, thereby enhancing catalyst stability. The modification of acid sites also helps in converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, which reduces the rate of coke formation during the PDH reaction.

催化剂支持材料的孔结构，特别是孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能具有重要影响。在引入层状孔后，通过改变文本属性并减少酸含量，显著增强了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。这导致焦炭沉积从活性金属表面转移到支撑表面。增强的焦炭容纳能力和抑制金属表面的焦炭形成有助于提高催化性能，特别是在丙烷转化率和稳定性方面。此外，氧化锡的存在促进了在催化剂表面的锚定，抑制了铂颗粒在反应过程中的进一步聚集，从而提高了催化剂稳定性。酸基团的修改也有助于将酸性基团转化为路易斯酸基团，从而降低反应过程中焦炭形成的速率。

1. The pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Changes to the pore structure, such as introducing hierarchical-pores, can reduce acid content, improve surface properties, and enhance the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke. The coke deposit migrates from the active metal to the support, improving catalyst stability and performance.

2. The hierarchical-pores in the new catalyst support, ZQ, enable better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The enhanced capacity to accommodate coke and the migration of coke from the active metal to the support are key factors contributing to these improvements.

3. The design of catalyst supports with controlled pore size distributions and hierarchical arrangements can lead to more effective catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, reducing coke formation and enhancing overall performance. Further research should focus on optimizing the control of pore size distribution in zeolite materials.

The pore structures, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support materials play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pore sizes and more hierarchical arrangements can reduce the rate of coke formation by improving the mobility of adsorbed species, facilitating their migration away from active metal surfaces. This allows for better accommodation of coke on the support rather than on the catalyst itself. As a result, catalysts with optimized pore structures can exhibit better PDH performance and stability. The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include the strategic creation of hierarchical pores within the support material, which can enhance the catalytic activity and stability by promoting efficient reactant and product transport, reducing coke formation, and enabling the migration of coke precursors to the support surface.

孔结构、连通性、均匀性和层次结构是催化剂支撑材料的关键因素，它们影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。较大的孔径和更复杂的层次结构可以通过提高吸附物种的流动性来减少焦炭形成率，促进其从活性金属表面迁移。这使得焦炭更容易被容纳在支撑材料上，而不是直接沉积在催化剂上。由此，具有优化孔结构的催化剂可以表现出更好的PDH性能和稳定性。设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义包括在支撑材料中战略性地创建层次孔隙，以增强催化活性和稳定性，通过促进有效反应物和产物传输、减少焦炭形成以及使焦炭前体迁移到支撑表面。

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the introduction of hierarchical-pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite support material enhances its capacity to accommodate coke by modifying its textural properties and reducing the acid content. This leads to a decreased tendency for coke to form on the active metal surface, and facilitates the migration of coke precursors to the external surface of the support. As a result, the PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits superior performance in terms of propane conversion and stability, compared to traditional ZSM-5 zeolite-supported catalysts. Optimizing the control of pore size distribution within the hierarchical-pores in zeolite is essential for further enhancing the design of optimal and effective catalysts.

催化剂支撑孔结构的特点，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级安排，在影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。具体而言，将层级孔引入ZSM-5沸石支持材料中，通过修改其文本特性并降低酸含量，增强了其容纳焦炭的能力。这导致焦炭在活性金属表面形成的倾向减少，并促进了焦炭前体向支持物外部表面的迁移。因此，PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂在丙烷转化率和稳定性方面表现出优于传统ZSM-5沸石负载催化剂的性能。控制层级孔在沸石内的孔径分布的优化对于进一步增强催化剂设计的优化和有效性至关重要。
