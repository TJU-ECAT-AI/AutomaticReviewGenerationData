The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the introduction of hierarchical-pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite support material enhances its capacity to accommodate coke by modifying its textural properties and reducing the acid content. This leads to a decreased tendency for coke to form on the active metal surface, and facilitates the migration of coke precursors to the external surface of the support. As a result, the PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits superior performance in terms of propane conversion and stability, compared to traditional ZSM-5 zeolite-supported catalysts. Optimizing the control of pore size distribution within the hierarchical-pores in zeolite is essential for further enhancing the design of optimal and effective catalysts.

催化剂支撑孔结构的特点，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级安排，在影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。具体而言，将层级孔引入ZSM-5沸石支持材料中，通过修改其文本特性并降低酸含量，增强了其容纳焦炭的能力。这导致焦炭在活性金属表面形成的倾向减少，并促进了焦炭前体向支持物外部表面的迁移。因此，PtSnNa/ZQ催化剂在丙烷转化率和稳定性方面表现出优于传统ZSM-5沸石负载催化剂的性能。控制层级孔在沸石内的孔径分布的优化对于进一步增强催化剂设计的优化和有效性至关重要。
