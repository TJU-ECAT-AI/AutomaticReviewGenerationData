[7] "From TPO analysis, the carbon deposits on the metallic surface of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst were strongly decreased, implying that Pt particles which located in the hierarchical-pores could avoid the rapid cover by carbon deposits."

1. The pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Changes to the pore structure, such as introducing hierarchical-pores, can reduce acid content, improve surface properties, and enhance the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke. The coke deposit migrates from the active metal to the support, improving catalyst stability and performance.

2. The hierarchical-pores in the new catalyst support, ZQ, enable better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. The enhanced capacity to accommodate coke and the migration of coke from the active metal to the support are key factors contributing to these improvements.

3. The design of catalyst supports with controlled pore size distributions and hierarchical arrangements can lead to more effective catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, reducing coke formation and enhancing overall performance. Further research should focus on optimizing the control of pore size distribution in zeolite materials.

1. 催化剂孔结构，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，对丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。改变孔结构，如引入层级孔，可以降低酸性、改善表面性质，并增强催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。焦炭沉积从活性金属转移到支撑上，提高了催化剂的稳定性和性能。

2. ZQ新型层级多孔ZSM-5支持材料中的层级孔使丙烷转化效率提高且催化剂稳定性增强。增强的焦炭容纳能力和焦炭从活性金属转移到支撑上的能力是这些改进的关键因素。

3. 在优化层状结构控制下设计催化剂支撑材料，可以导致更有效的催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中使用，减少焦炭形成并增强整体性能。进一步的研究应专注于优化ZSM-5材料的孔径大小分布。
