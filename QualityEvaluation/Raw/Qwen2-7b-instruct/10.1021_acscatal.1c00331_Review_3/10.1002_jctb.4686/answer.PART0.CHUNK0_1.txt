The pore structures of catalyst support materials, specifically pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Hierarchical-pores, when introduced into the zeolite structure, notably enhance the capacity to accommodate coke by altering the textural properties and reducing acid content. This results in a shift of coke deposits from the active metal surface to the support surface. The enhanced accommodation of coke and the suppression of coke formation on the metal surface contribute to improved catalytic performance, particularly in terms of propane conversion and stability. Moreover, the existence of more oxide forms of tin facilitates anchoring on the catalyst surface, inhibiting further agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, thereby enhancing catalyst stability. The modification of acid sites also helps in converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, which reduces the rate of coke formation during the PDH reaction.

催化剂支持材料的孔结构，特别是孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能具有重要影响。在引入层状孔后，通过改变文本属性并减少酸含量，显著增强了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。这导致焦炭沉积从活性金属表面转移到支撑表面。增强的焦炭容纳能力和抑制金属表面的焦炭形成有助于提高催化性能，特别是在丙烷转化率和稳定性方面。此外，氧化锡的存在促进了在催化剂表面的锚定，抑制了铂颗粒在反应过程中的进一步聚集，从而提高了催化剂稳定性。酸基团的修改也有助于将酸性基团转化为路易斯酸基团，从而降低反应过程中焦炭形成的速率。
