[1] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted."
[2] "These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
[3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
[4] "By using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."

The pore structures, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support materials play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pore sizes and more hierarchical arrangements can reduce the rate of coke formation by improving the mobility of adsorbed species, facilitating their migration away from active metal surfaces. This allows for better accommodation of coke on the support rather than on the catalyst itself. As a result, catalysts with optimized pore structures can exhibit better PDH performance and stability. The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include the strategic creation of hierarchical pores within the support material, which can enhance the catalytic activity and stability by promoting efficient reactant and product transport, reducing coke formation, and enabling the migration of coke precursors to the support surface.

孔结构、连通性、均匀性和层次结构是催化剂支撑材料的关键因素，它们影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。较大的孔径和更复杂的层次结构可以通过提高吸附物种的流动性来减少焦炭形成率，促进其从活性金属表面迁移。这使得焦炭更容易被容纳在支撑材料上，而不是直接沉积在催化剂上。由此，具有优化孔结构的催化剂可以表现出更好的PDH性能和稳定性。设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义包括在支撑材料中战略性地创建层次孔隙，以增强催化活性和稳定性，通过促进有效反应物和产物传输、减少焦炭形成以及使焦炭前体迁移到支撑表面。
