[1] "Hierarchical-pores are directly introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite. This new zeolite was used as a support for PtSnNa-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."
[3] "Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support."
[4] "By using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted."
[5] "The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ not only modified the textual properties but also influenced the acid content of zeolite."
[6] "Moreover, the weakened acid sites and existence of oxide Sn in ZQ suppressed the coke precursor forming on the metal and even facilitated migration of the coke precursor to the external surface of the support."
[7] "From TPO analysis, the carbon deposits on the metallic surface of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst were strongly decreased, implying that Pt particles which located in the hierarchical-pores could avoid the rapid cover by carbon deposits."
[8] "Based on these results, in comparison with traditional ZSM-5 zeolite, PtSnNa/ZQ possessed better propane conversion and greater stability of the catalyst."

1. The introduction of hierarchical-pores into ZSM-5 zeolite enhances its capacity to accommodate coke, leading to improved catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The coke deposits migrate from the active metal surface to the support, improving the overall stability of the catalyst.

2. The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and the overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Hierarchical-pores in the support material facilitate the migration of coke precursor from the active metal surface to the external surface of the support, reducing coke formation on the active metal.

3. The design of optimal and effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation involves controlling the pore size distribution of hierarchical-pores within the zeolite support. This allows for better transport of reactant and product molecules, improves catalytic activity, and stability by inhibiting the further agglomeration of metal particles during the reaction process. The weakened acidity of the support also contributes to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction.

4. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include the strategic modification of zeolite supports to incorporate hierarchical-pores. This strategy enhances the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke, reduces coke formation on the active metal, and promotes the stability of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 引入层次孔结构到ZSM-5沸石中可以增强其容纳焦炭的能力，从而提高丙烷裂解反应的催化性能。焦炭沉积物从活性金属表面迁移至支撑体上，改善了催化剂的整体稳定性。

2. 催化剂支持孔结构特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，对丙烷裂解反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。层级孔结构在支撑材料中促进了焦炭前驱体从活性金属表面向支撑体外部表面的迁移，减少了活性金属上的焦炭形成。

3. 设计最佳和有效催化剂以进行丙烷裂解反应涉及控制层级孔结构在沸石支持物中的孔尺寸分布。这允许更好地传输反应物和产物分子，提高了催化活性和稳定性，并通过抑制反应过程中金属颗粒的进一步聚集来促进催化剂稳定性。支撑体的弱酸性也有助于降低反应过程中的焦炭形成速率。

4. 这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义包括策略性修改沸石支持物以引入层级孔结构。这种策略增强了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力，减少了活性金属上的焦炭形成，并促进了催化剂在丙烷裂解反应过程中的稳定性。
