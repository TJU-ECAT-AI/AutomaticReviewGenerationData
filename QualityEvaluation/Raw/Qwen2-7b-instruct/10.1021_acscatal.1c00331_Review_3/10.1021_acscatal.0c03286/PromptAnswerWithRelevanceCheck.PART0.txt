[1] "Great efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and stability of Pt catalysts, and it has been shown that the Pt particle size is proposed to have a significant impact on catalytic performance."
[2] "The size dependence of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be categorized into three regions."
[3] "As the Pt loading decreases, a shift of the Pt 4d5/2 B.E. toward higher values occurred and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species gradually increased."
[4] "For 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, the Pt species exists as privileged single Ptδ+ atoms, while the peak of the linear-bonded CO on Pt0 is more obvious for 0.3% Pt/Al2O3."
[5] "These results clearly indicate that weakened propylene adsorption on the atomically dispersed 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates desorption rather than deep dehydrogenation, thus leading to higher levels of selectivity compared to the 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 sub-nanocatalyst and the 3% Pt/Al2O3 nanocatalyst."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The pore size determines the accommodation of reactants and products, connectivity affects the diffusion pathways, uniformity ensures a consistent reaction environment, and hierarchical arrangements provide a multi-scale environment for reaction. 

When the pore size is optimized, it can facilitate efficient mass transfer and prevent coke formation. Connectivity allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, avoiding local concentration buildup. Uniformity ensures a homogeneous reaction environment, minimizing spatial variations that could lead to hotspots for coke formation. Hierarchical arrangements, featuring a combination of micro-, meso-, and macropores, offer a balance between pore accessibility and resistance, enhancing both reactivity and stability.

Implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include selecting pore structures that match the reaction kinetics, minimizing coke formation, and maximizing product selectivity. By carefully controlling pore properties, it is possible to tailor catalysts that perform well under specific operating conditions, leading to improved efficiency and reduced costs. For instance, a catalyst with highly interconnected and uniform pores can enhance the diffusion of reactants, reduce coke formation, and maintain high selectivity towards the desired product, propylene.

The relationship between catalyst support pore structures and PDH performance highlights the importance of considering pore engineering in catalyst design. Optimal pore structures can significantly improve catalyst activity, stability, and selectivity, making them crucial factors in the development of more efficient and sustainable propane dehydrogenation processes.

[1] "The amount of deposited coke was quantitatively determined by TG in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively (as shown in Table 4)."
[2] "The discrepancy of weight loss between O2 and N2 is due to the nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon, which can be easily gasified in O2 rather than in N2, as previously reported."
[3] "When compared with 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3, the retention time of main peaks in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 significantly prolonged, indicating the production of the longer-chain volatile aliphatic coke (C16C26) due to the lack of multiple PtPt sites."

The coke formation and accommodation in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are influenced by the pore structures of the catalyst support. Specifically, the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements play crucial roles. Smaller pores and more uniform pore structures tend to accommodate coke more efficiently, leading to faster coke formation and higher coke content. This is because smaller pores offer less resistance for coke particles to adhere and grow, thus accelerating the coking process. Conversely, larger pores or more interconnected pore structures can hinder coke deposition and growth, resulting in slower coke formation and lower coke content.

Hierarchical pore structures, which combine pores of different sizes, can further regulate coke formation. These structures allow for a balance between coke accommodation and catalyst accessibility, potentially enhancing the overall catalyst performance. The presence of pregraphite-like carbon, a type of carbon deficient in hydrogen, is more prevalent on catalysts with multiple Pt-Pt sites. This carbon is formed due to the deep dehydrogenation of propylene, a process facilitated by the interaction between multiple Pt atoms. 

In the case of atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, the lack of multiple Pt-Pt sites effectively inhibits the deep dehydrogenation of propylene and the subsequent secondary reactions of coke. This leads to improved propylene selectivity and stability, as the propylene adsorbed on the catalyst prefers to desorb rather than undergo undesired side reactions. Consequently, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites results in a reduction of coke formation and a decrease in the coking rate, contributing to the overall enhancement of catalyst performance.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级排列，对丙烷脱氢反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。较小的孔径和更均匀的孔结构倾向于更高效地容纳焦炭，导致较快的焦炭形成和较高的焦炭含量。这是因为较小的孔隙提供较少阻力供焦炭颗粒附着和生长，从而加速了结焦过程。相反，较大的孔径或更相互连接的孔结构可以阻碍焦炭沉积和生长，导致较慢的焦炭形成和较低的焦炭含量。

层级孔结构，结合不同大小的孔隙，可以进一步调节焦炭形成。这些结构允许平衡焦炭容纳和催化剂可访问性，可能增强整体催化剂性能。由于多个Pt-Pt位点的存在，形成了预石墨碳，这是一种氢含量低的碳。这种碳是由于丙烯的深度脱氢形成的，这是一个由多个Pt原子之间的相互作用促进的过程。

对于原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂，在缺乏多个Pt-Pt位点的情况下，有效地抑制了丙烯的深度脱氢和焦炭的后续二次反应。这导致丙烯选择性和稳定性得到改善，因为吸附在催化剂上的丙烯更倾向于释放而不是经历不希望的副反应。因此，缺乏多个Pt-Pt位点导致焦炭形成减少和结焦速率降低，从而增强催化剂的整体性能。

The pore structures of the catalyst support play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores affect how coke forms, accumulates, and interacts with the catalyst. Smaller pore sizes can lead to higher resistance to coke formation, as the smaller spaces limit the growth and accumulation of coke particles. Connectivity and uniformity of the pores ensure efficient mass transfer and prevent the formation of localized hotspots that can accelerate coke formation. Hierarchical pore structures, featuring both macropores and micropores, can accommodate a wider range of coke sizes, enhancing the catalyst's ability to handle different coke compositions and reducing the risk of blocking or deactivation. The presence of multiple PtPt sites, often found in larger particles, can be a key factor in promoting undesirable side reactions such as cracking and secondary reactions, which can lead to coke formation. By reducing the particle size to subnanometer clusters or achieving atomic-level dispersion, the catalyst can minimize these multiple PtPt sites, thereby inhibiting undesired reactions and improving the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include selecting or engineering pore structures that promote efficient mass transfer, minimize localized hotspots, and control the formation and accommodation of coke, while maximizing the active surface area and the number of active sites per unit volume.

催化剂支持的孔结构在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、积聚和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响焦炭的形成、积累以及与催化剂的相互作用。较小的孔径可以导致更高的焦炭形成阻力，因为更小的空间限制了焦炭颗粒的增长和积累。孔的连通性和均匀性确保了高效的物质传输，并防止形成可能导致焦炭加速形成的局部热点。具有多级孔结构（包括大孔和微孔），可以容纳不同大小的焦炭，增强催化剂处理不同焦炭组成的能力，并减少堵塞或失活的风险。在更大颗粒中通常存在的多个PtPt位点可能是促进不希望的副反应的关键因素，如裂解和随后的次级反应，这会导致焦炭形成。通过将颗粒尺寸减小到亚纳米簇或实现原子级分散，催化剂可以最小化这些多个PtPt位点，从而抑制不希望的反应并提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义包括选择或工程孔结构以促进高效的物质传输、防止形成局部热点，并控制焦炭的形成和积聚，同时最大化单位体积内的活性表面积和活性位点数量。

The pore structure characteristics of the catalyst support, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature indicates that when the Pt particle size is reduced to subnanometer-sized clusters, particularly when Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the highly dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance while retaining high propylene selectivity and stability. This performance is attributed to the positively charged platinum centers that favor the preferential adsorption of propane. Instead of over-dehydrogenating, the propylene adsorbed on the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst prefers to desorb, resulting in improved selectivity. The absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibits undesirable side reactions such as CC cracking, which improves propylene selectivity and anticoking ability. The systematic exploration of the size dependence of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH demonstrates the potential for designing catalysts with minimal use of noble metals that are effective and have broad industrial applications.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。文献表明，当铂颗粒尺寸减小到亚纳米簇（<1nm），特别是当铂颗粒实现原子级分散时，高度分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂表现出优越的催化性能，同时保持高丙烯选择性和稳定性。这种性能归因于有利于丙烷优先吸附的正电荷铂中心。与直接过热解不同，吸附在原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂上的丙烯倾向于释放，从而提高了选择性。没有多个PtPt位点的存在有效地抑制了需要多个铂原子结合的CC裂解等不希望发生的副反应，这改善了丙烯选择性和抗结焦能力。对Pt/Al2O3催化剂大小依赖性的系统研究揭示了设计使用少量贵金属但仍有效的催化剂的潜力，这些催化剂具有广泛工业应用的前景。
