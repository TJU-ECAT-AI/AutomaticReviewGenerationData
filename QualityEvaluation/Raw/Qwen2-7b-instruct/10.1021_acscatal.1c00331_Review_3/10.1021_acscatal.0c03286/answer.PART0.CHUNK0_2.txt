[1] "The amount of deposited coke was quantitatively determined by TG in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively (as shown in Table 4)."
[2] "Figure 9 shows that the weight loss of the spent 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is the lowest (ca. 1.5 wt %) in the O2 atmosphere, and the difference of weight loss between O2 and N2 is negligible."
[3] "When compared with 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3, the retention time of main peaks in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 significantly prolonged, indicating the production of the longer-chain volatile aliphatic coke (C16C26) due to the lack of multiple PtPt sites."

The pore structures of the catalyst support play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores affect how coke forms, accumulates, and interacts with the catalyst. Smaller pore sizes can lead to higher resistance to coke formation, as the smaller spaces limit the growth and accumulation of coke particles. Connectivity and uniformity of the pores ensure efficient mass transfer and prevent the formation of localized hotspots that can accelerate coke formation. Hierarchical pore structures, featuring both macropores and micropores, can accommodate a wider range of coke sizes, enhancing the catalyst's ability to handle different coke compositions and reducing the risk of blocking or deactivation. The presence of multiple PtPt sites, often found in larger particles, can be a key factor in promoting undesirable side reactions such as cracking and secondary reactions, which can lead to coke formation. By reducing the particle size to subnanometer clusters or achieving atomic-level dispersion, the catalyst can minimize these multiple PtPt sites, thereby inhibiting undesired reactions and improving the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include selecting or engineering pore structures that promote efficient mass transfer, minimize localized hotspots, and control the formation and accommodation of coke, while maximizing the active surface area and the number of active sites per unit volume.

催化剂支持的孔结构在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、积聚和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响焦炭的形成、积累以及与催化剂的相互作用。较小的孔径可以导致更高的焦炭形成阻力，因为更小的空间限制了焦炭颗粒的增长和积累。孔的连通性和均匀性确保了高效的物质传输，并防止形成可能导致焦炭加速形成的局部热点。具有多级孔结构（包括大孔和微孔），可以容纳不同大小的焦炭，增强催化剂处理不同焦炭组成的能力，并减少堵塞或失活的风险。在更大颗粒中通常存在的多个PtPt位点可能是促进不希望的副反应的关键因素，如裂解和随后的次级反应，这会导致焦炭形成。通过将颗粒尺寸减小到亚纳米簇或实现原子级分散，催化剂可以最小化这些多个PtPt位点，从而抑制不希望的反应并提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的含义包括选择或工程孔结构以促进高效的物质传输、防止形成局部热点，并控制焦炭的形成和积聚，同时最大化单位体积内的活性表面积和活性位点数量。
