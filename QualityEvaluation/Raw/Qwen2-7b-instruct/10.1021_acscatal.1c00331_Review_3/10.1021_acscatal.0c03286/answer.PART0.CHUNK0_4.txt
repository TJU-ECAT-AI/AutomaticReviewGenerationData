[1] "The amount of deposited coke was quantitatively determined by TG in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively (as shown in Table 4)."
[2] "The discrepancy of weight loss between O2 and N2 is due to the nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon, which can be easily gasified in O2 rather than in N2, as previously reported."
[3] "Pyrolysis GCMS analysis was further carried out to identify the composition of coke (Figure 10)."

The coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are influenced by the pore structures of the catalyst support. The pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements play crucial roles in coke formation. Smaller pore sizes can hinder the accommodation of coke, potentially leading to higher selectivity and stability. Connectivity affects the diffusion pathways of reactants and products, influencing the reaction rates. Uniform pore structures promote more consistent reactivity across the catalyst surface. Hierarchical pore structures, featuring both macropores and micropores, can optimize the balance between diffusion and adsorption, enhancing catalyst performance. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include the development of supports with tailored pore architectures that minimize coke formation while maximizing reactivity and selectivity. This can lead to catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions.

催化剂支撑的孔结构特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。较小的孔径可以阻碍焦炭的容纳，可能提高选择性和稳定性。连通性影响反应物和产物的扩散路径，影响反应速率。均匀的孔结构可以在催化剂表面提供更一致的活性。具有宏观孔和微观孔的层次结构孔可以优化扩散与吸附之间的平衡，从而增强催化剂性能。这些关系对于设计高效催化剂的含义包括开发具有定制孔结构的支撑材料，以减少焦炭形成并最大化活性和选择性。这可能导致在PDH反应中具有改进的活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。
