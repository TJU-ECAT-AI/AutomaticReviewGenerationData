[1] "The amount of deposited coke was quantitatively determined by TG in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively (as shown in Table 4)."
[2] "The discrepancy of weight loss between O2 and N2 is due to the nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon, which can be easily gasified in O2 rather than in N2, as previously reported."
[3] "When compared with 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3, the retention time of main peaks in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 significantly prolonged, indicating the production of the longer-chain volatile aliphatic coke (C16C26) due to the lack of multiple PtPt sites."

The coke formation and accommodation in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are influenced by the pore structures of the catalyst support. Specifically, the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements play crucial roles. Smaller pores and more uniform pore structures tend to accommodate coke more efficiently, leading to faster coke formation and higher coke content. This is because smaller pores offer less resistance for coke particles to adhere and grow, thus accelerating the coking process. Conversely, larger pores or more interconnected pore structures can hinder coke deposition and growth, resulting in slower coke formation and lower coke content.

Hierarchical pore structures, which combine pores of different sizes, can further regulate coke formation. These structures allow for a balance between coke accommodation and catalyst accessibility, potentially enhancing the overall catalyst performance. The presence of pregraphite-like carbon, a type of carbon deficient in hydrogen, is more prevalent on catalysts with multiple Pt-Pt sites. This carbon is formed due to the deep dehydrogenation of propylene, a process facilitated by the interaction between multiple Pt atoms. 

In the case of atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, the lack of multiple Pt-Pt sites effectively inhibits the deep dehydrogenation of propylene and the subsequent secondary reactions of coke. This leads to improved propylene selectivity and stability, as the propylene adsorbed on the catalyst prefers to desorb rather than undergo undesired side reactions. Consequently, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites results in a reduction of coke formation and a decrease in the coking rate, contributing to the overall enhancement of catalyst performance.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级排列，对丙烷脱氢反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。较小的孔径和更均匀的孔结构倾向于更高效地容纳焦炭，导致较快的焦炭形成和较高的焦炭含量。这是因为较小的孔隙提供较少阻力供焦炭颗粒附着和生长，从而加速了结焦过程。相反，较大的孔径或更相互连接的孔结构可以阻碍焦炭沉积和生长，导致较慢的焦炭形成和较低的焦炭含量。

层级孔结构，结合不同大小的孔隙，可以进一步调节焦炭形成。这些结构允许平衡焦炭容纳和催化剂可访问性，可能增强整体催化剂性能。由于多个Pt-Pt位点的存在，形成了预石墨碳，这是一种氢含量低的碳。这种碳是由于丙烯的深度脱氢形成的，这是一个由多个Pt原子之间的相互作用促进的过程。

对于原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂，在缺乏多个Pt-Pt位点的情况下，有效地抑制了丙烯的深度脱氢和焦炭的后续二次反应。这导致丙烯选择性和稳定性得到改善，因为吸附在催化剂上的丙烯更倾向于释放而不是经历不希望的副反应。因此，缺乏多个Pt-Pt位点导致焦炭形成减少和结焦速率降低，从而增强催化剂的整体性能。
