[1] "The amount of deposited coke was quantitatively determined by TG in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively (as shown in Table 4)."
[2] "Figure 9 shows that the weight loss of the spent 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is the lowest (ca. 1.5 wt %) in the O2 atmosphere, and the difference of weight loss between O2 and N2 is negligible."
[3] "When compared with 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3, the retention time of main peaks in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 significantly prolonged, indicating the production of the longer-chain volatile aliphatic coke (C16C26) due to the lack of multiple PtPt sites."

The pore structure characteristics of the catalyst support, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature indicates that when the Pt particle size is reduced to subnanometer-sized clusters, particularly when Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the highly dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance while retaining high propylene selectivity and stability. This performance is attributed to the positively charged platinum centers that favor the preferential adsorption of propane. Instead of over-dehydrogenating, the propylene adsorbed on the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst prefers to desorb, resulting in improved selectivity. The absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibits undesirable side reactions such as CC cracking, which improves propylene selectivity and anticoking ability. The systematic exploration of the size dependence of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH demonstrates the potential for designing catalysts with minimal use of noble metals that are effective and have broad industrial applications.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。文献表明，当铂颗粒尺寸减小到亚纳米簇（<1nm），特别是当铂颗粒实现原子级分散时，高度分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂表现出优越的催化性能，同时保持高丙烯选择性和稳定性。这种性能归因于有利于丙烷优先吸附的正电荷铂中心。与直接过热解不同，吸附在原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂上的丙烯倾向于释放，从而提高了选择性。没有多个PtPt位点的存在有效地抑制了需要多个铂原子结合的CC裂解等不希望发生的副反应，这改善了丙烯选择性和抗结焦能力。对Pt/Al2O3催化剂大小依赖性的系统研究揭示了设计使用少量贵金属但仍有效的催化剂的潜力，这些催化剂具有广泛工业应用的前景。
