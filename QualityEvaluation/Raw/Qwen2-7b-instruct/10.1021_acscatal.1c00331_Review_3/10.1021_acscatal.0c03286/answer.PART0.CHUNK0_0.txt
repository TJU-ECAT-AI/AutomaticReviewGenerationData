[1] "Great efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and stability of Pt catalysts, and it has been shown that the Pt particle size is proposed to have a significant impact on catalytic performance."
[2] "The size dependence of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be categorized into three regions."
[3] "As the Pt loading decreases, a shift of the Pt 4d5/2 B.E. toward higher values occurred and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species gradually increased."
[4] "For 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, the Pt species exists as privileged single Ptδ+ atoms, while the peak of the linear-bonded CO on Pt0 is more obvious for 0.3% Pt/Al2O3."
[5] "These results clearly indicate that weakened propylene adsorption on the atomically dispersed 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates desorption rather than deep dehydrogenation, thus leading to higher levels of selectivity compared to the 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 sub-nanocatalyst and the 3% Pt/Al2O3 nanocatalyst."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The pore size determines the accommodation of reactants and products, connectivity affects the diffusion pathways, uniformity ensures a consistent reaction environment, and hierarchical arrangements provide a multi-scale environment for reaction. 

When the pore size is optimized, it can facilitate efficient mass transfer and prevent coke formation. Connectivity allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, avoiding local concentration buildup. Uniformity ensures a homogeneous reaction environment, minimizing spatial variations that could lead to hotspots for coke formation. Hierarchical arrangements, featuring a combination of micro-, meso-, and macropores, offer a balance between pore accessibility and resistance, enhancing both reactivity and stability.

Implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include selecting pore structures that match the reaction kinetics, minimizing coke formation, and maximizing product selectivity. By carefully controlling pore properties, it is possible to tailor catalysts that perform well under specific operating conditions, leading to improved efficiency and reduced costs. For instance, a catalyst with highly interconnected and uniform pores can enhance the diffusion of reactants, reduce coke formation, and maintain high selectivity towards the desired product, propylene.

The relationship between catalyst support pore structures and PDH performance highlights the importance of considering pore engineering in catalyst design. Optimal pore structures can significantly improve catalyst activity, stability, and selectivity, making them crucial factors in the development of more efficient and sustainable propane dehydrogenation processes.
