[1] "We found that SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3, despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles."
[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. In the study, it was observed that SiO2-supported PtZn intermetallic catalysts demonstrated superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Al2O3-supported counterparts, despite having similar-sized PtZn particles. The reason attributed to this difference lies in the acidic nature of the supports. Al2O3 has a stronger acidity than SiO2, which leads to increased coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The Raman spectra analysis further confirmed that the coke amount and graphitization degree of the spent catalysts were significantly lower on SiO2, indicating a reduced risk of coking. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate support materials with controlled acidity and pore structure to enhance the stability and efficiency of PDH catalysts.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有着关键影响。在研究中发现，SiO2支持的PtZn互金属催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面优于Al2O3，尽管PtZn颗粒大小相似。这种差异的原因归咎于支撑材料的酸性性质。Al2O3比SiO2具有更强的酸性，导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。进一步的拉曼光谱分析证实，SiO2上的剩余催化剂中的焦炭量和石墨化程度显著低于Al2O3，表明焦炭形成的风险较小。这些发现强调了选择具有控制酸性和孔结构适当的支持材料对于提高PDH催化剂的稳定性和效率的重要性。
