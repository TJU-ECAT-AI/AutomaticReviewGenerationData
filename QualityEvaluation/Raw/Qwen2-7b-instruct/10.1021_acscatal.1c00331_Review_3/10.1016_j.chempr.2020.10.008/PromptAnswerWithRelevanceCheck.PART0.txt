[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16)."
[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. In this study, it was found that PtZn supported on SiO2 showed better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3, despite having similar sizes of PtZn particles. The reason for this difference lies in the support's acidity, which is stronger in Al2O3 than in SiO2. This stronger acidity leads to coking and catalyst deactivation. Furthermore, the Raman spectra analysis of the spent catalysts demonstrated that the coke amount and graphitization degree of PtZn/SiO2 were significantly lower than those of PtZn/Al2O3, highlighting the role of support choice in reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst stability during PDH reactions.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构排列，显著影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能。在本研究中发现，与Al2O3相比，在SiO2上支持的PtZn表现出更好的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，尽管PtZn粒子的大小相似。这种差异的原因在于支撑物的酸性，Al2O3的酸性比SiO2强。这种更强的酸性导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。此外，对废弃催化剂的拉曼光谱分析表明，PtZn/SiO2中的焦炭量和石墨化程度远低于PtZn/Al2O3，这突出了在减少焦炭形成和保持PDH反应期间催化剂稳定性方面，选择支撑物的重要性。

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study indicates that the selection of support material can significantly affect the performance of PtZn intermetallic catalysts. For instance, SiO2 supports enable better propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Al2O3, even with similar-sized PtZn particles. This difference can be attributed to the weak interaction between metals and SiO2, facilitating more extensive metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which aids in the formation of intermetallic structures. The weaker acidity of SiO2 supports also reduces the risk of coking and catalyst deactivation, leading to lower coke amounts and graphitization degrees. Consequently, the choice of support material can optimize the catalytic performance by mitigating coke formation and enhancing the stability of the catalyst.

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, materials like SiO2 that interact weakly with metals facilitate a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying, which may enhance the formation of intermetallic compounds like PtZn IMA. This leads to improved performance and reduced coke formation. In contrast, supports with stronger acidity, like Al2O3, can lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. The Raman spectra of the spent catalysts further confirm that the amount of coke and the degree of graphitization on PtZn/SiO2 are significantly lower than those on PtZn/Al2O3, indicating the effectiveness of SiO2 as a support material in suppressing coke formation and enhancing catalyst stability.

In the study, it was observed that SiO2-supported PtZn intermetallic catalysts demonstrated superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Al2O3-supported counterparts, despite having similar-sized PtZn particles. The reason attributed to this difference lies in the acidic nature of the supports. Al2O3 has a stronger acidity than SiO2, which leads to increased coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The Raman spectra analysis further confirmed that the coke amount and graphitization degree of the spent catalysts were significantly lower on SiO2, indicating a reduced risk of coking. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate support materials with controlled acidity and pore structure to enhance the stability and efficiency of PDH catalysts.

The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports, particularly their size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study reveals that SiO2-supported PtZn intermetallic catalysts outperform Al2O3-supported counterparts in terms of both propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The improved performance can be attributed to the weak interaction between SiO2 and metals, facilitating enhanced metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn. This strengthens the intermetallic structure, which is essential for the formation of the desired catalyst. In contrast, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports contributes to coke formation and catalyst deactivation, as evidenced by the increased coke amount and higher graphitization degree observed in the spent catalysts. These findings suggest that selecting appropriate support materials with favorable pore structures can significantly impact the performance and stability of PDH catalysts, thereby influencing their efficiency and longevity in industrial applications.
