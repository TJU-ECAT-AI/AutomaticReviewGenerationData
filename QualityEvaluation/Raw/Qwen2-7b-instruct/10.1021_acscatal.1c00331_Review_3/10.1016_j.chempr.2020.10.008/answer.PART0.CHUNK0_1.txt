[1] "Additionally, supports could influence the structures of PtZn alloys and thus dehydrogenation performance."
[2] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16)."
[3] "The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."
[4] "Consequently, there was a lower CO adsorption band position (2,047 cm1) over PtZn/SiO2 than that over PtZn/Al2O3 (2,069 cm1) (Figure S5)."
[5] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study indicates that the selection of support material can significantly affect the performance of PtZn intermetallic catalysts. For instance, SiO2 supports enable better propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Al2O3, even with similar-sized PtZn particles. This difference can be attributed to the weak interaction between metals and SiO2, facilitating more extensive metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which aids in the formation of intermetallic structures. The weaker acidity of SiO2 supports also reduces the risk of coking and catalyst deactivation, leading to lower coke amounts and graphitization degrees. Consequently, the choice of support material can optimize the catalytic performance by mitigating coke formation and enhancing the stability of the catalyst.

催化剂支持孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能起着关键作用。研究表明，选择支撑材料可以显著影响PtZn互金属催化剂的性能。例如，与Al2O3相比，SiO2支持物能提供更好的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，即使PtZn颗粒大小相似。这种差异可以归因于金属与SiO2之间较弱的相互作用，促进了Pt和Zn之间的更广泛的金属相互作用和合金化，从而有助于互金属结构的形成。SiO2支持物的弱酸性也减少了结焦和催化剂失活的风险，导致较低的焦炭量和石墨化程度。因此，通过优化焦炭形成和增强催化剂稳定性，选择合适的支撑材料可以优化催化性能。
