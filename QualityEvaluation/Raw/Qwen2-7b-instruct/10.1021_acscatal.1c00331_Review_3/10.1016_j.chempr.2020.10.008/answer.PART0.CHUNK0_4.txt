[1] "We found that SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3, despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles."
[2] "The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."
[3] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports, particularly their size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study reveals that SiO2-supported PtZn intermetallic catalysts outperform Al2O3-supported counterparts in terms of both propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The improved performance can be attributed to the weak interaction between SiO2 and metals, facilitating enhanced metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn. This strengthens the intermetallic structure, which is essential for the formation of the desired catalyst. In contrast, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports contributes to coke formation and catalyst deactivation, as evidenced by the increased coke amount and higher graphitization degree observed in the spent catalysts. These findings suggest that selecting appropriate support materials with favorable pore structures can significantly impact the performance and stability of PDH catalysts, thereby influencing their efficiency and longevity in industrial applications.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性，尤其是它们的大小、连通性、均匀性和层级排列，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中起着关键作用。研究表明，SiO2支持的PtZn间金属催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面优于Al2O3支持的催化剂。这种改进的表现可以归因于SiO2与金属之间较弱的相互作用，这促进了Pt和Zn之间的增强金属相互作用和合金化，这对于形成所需的催化剂至关重要。相比之下，Al2O3支持材料的更强酸性导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活，这是通过增加焦炭量和更高的石墨化程度在耗尽催化剂中观察到的。这些发现表明，选择具有有利孔结构的适当支持材料可以显著影响PDH催化剂的性能和稳定性，从而影响其工业应用的效率和寿命。
