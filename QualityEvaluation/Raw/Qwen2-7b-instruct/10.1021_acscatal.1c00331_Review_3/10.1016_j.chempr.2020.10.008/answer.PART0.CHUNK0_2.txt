[1] "The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."
[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, materials like SiO2 that interact weakly with metals facilitate a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying, which may enhance the formation of intermetallic compounds like PtZn IMA. This leads to improved performance and reduced coke formation. In contrast, supports with stronger acidity, like Al2O3, can lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. The Raman spectra of the spent catalysts further confirm that the amount of coke and the degree of graphitization on PtZn/SiO2 are significantly lower than those on PtZn/Al2O3, indicating the effectiveness of SiO2 as a support material in suppressing coke formation and enhancing catalyst stability.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级排列，显著影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。具体来说，与金属作用弱的材料如SiO2可以促进金属间更广泛的相互作用和合金化，这可能有助于形成如PtZn IMA的互金属化合物。这会提高性能并减少焦炭形成。相比之下，具有更强酸性的支持材料，如Al2O3，可能导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。通过烧结后的催化剂的拉曼光谱进一步表明，PtZn/SiO2上的焦炭量和石墨化程度远低于PtZn/Al2O3，这表明选择SiO2作为支持材料在抑制焦炭形成和增强催化剂稳定性方面是有效的。
