[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16)."
[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. In this study, it was found that PtZn supported on SiO2 showed better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3, despite having similar sizes of PtZn particles. The reason for this difference lies in the support's acidity, which is stronger in Al2O3 than in SiO2. This stronger acidity leads to coking and catalyst deactivation. Furthermore, the Raman spectra analysis of the spent catalysts demonstrated that the coke amount and graphitization degree of PtZn/SiO2 were significantly lower than those of PtZn/Al2O3, highlighting the role of support choice in reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst stability during PDH reactions.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构排列，显著影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能。在本研究中发现，与Al2O3相比，在SiO2上支持的PtZn表现出更好的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，尽管PtZn粒子的大小相似。这种差异的原因在于支撑物的酸性，Al2O3的酸性比SiO2强。这种更强的酸性导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。此外，对废弃催化剂的拉曼光谱分析表明，PtZn/SiO2中的焦炭量和石墨化程度远低于PtZn/Al2O3，这突出了在减少焦炭形成和保持PDH反应期间催化剂稳定性方面，选择支撑物的重要性。
