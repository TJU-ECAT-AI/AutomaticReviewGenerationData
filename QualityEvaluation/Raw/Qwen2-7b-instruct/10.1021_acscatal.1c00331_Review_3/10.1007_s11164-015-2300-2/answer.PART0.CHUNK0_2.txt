<p>It was reported that exothermic temperature was minimized by controlling oxygen contents and heater programs.</p>
<p>In addition, even with controlled coke removal, the metal crystallites may become unavoidably sintered during regeneration processes.</p>
<p>As metal crystallites become larger in diameter, the activity will be decreased.</p>
<p>It was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst.</p>
<p>Propyne conversions of catalysts were determined for 300 min and are presented in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>The conversion of propane was evaluated in the presence of fresh catalyst (1Pt0.5Sn-C) at first and used as a baseline.</p>

The pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors determine how easily coke can form and how well it is accommodated within the catalyst structure, affecting the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Designing catalysts with optimized pore structures can lead to better coke management and enhanced performance. The implications of these relationships suggest the importance of considering pore structure during catalyst design to ensure optimal PDH reactions.
