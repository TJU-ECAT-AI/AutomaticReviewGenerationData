The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors affect how coke interacts with the catalyst surface, its ability to be accommodated within the pores, and its impact on the catalyst's efficiency and longevity. For instance, smaller pore sizes might hinder the easy movement and accommodation of coke, potentially leading to more localized coke formation and easier removal. Conversely, larger pore sizes could facilitate the diffusion of coke, making it harder to control its deposition and leading to more extensive and challenging-to-remove coke layers. Connectivity and uniformity of the pore structure can influence the fluid dynamics within the catalyst bed, affecting the reaction kinetics and product yields. Hierarchical pore structures, featuring both macropores and micropores, can offer a balance between fluid accessibility and coke trapping, optimizing the catalyst's performance.

These relationships imply that designing optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions requires careful consideration of pore structure characteristics. Catalyst supports with tailored pore architectures can enhance the catalyst's ability to withstand coke formation, improve coke removal efficiency, and maintain high conversion rates and product yields over multiple cycles. This is particularly important for ensuring the long-term stability and economic viability of PDH processes. The use of materials science principles, such as pore engineering, can guide the development of catalyst supports with ideal pore properties, contributing to the design of highly efficient and durable catalysts for PDH applications.

The effectiveness of the proposed oxychlorination treatment in improving the regeneration of PDH catalysts is attributed to its ability to increase the mobility of Pt species. This enhanced mobility facilitates more effective redispersion of Pt particles during the hydrogen reduction step, which helps mitigate the sintering issue and restores the catalyst's activity. By controlling the HCl concentration, the study found that the best recovery of catalytic activity was achieved at a specific HCl concentration, indicating the importance of precise conditions in achieving optimal catalyst regeneration. The use of oxychlorination thus represents a promising approach to enhancing the performance of PDH catalysts by promoting Pt redispersion and mitigating the detrimental effects of sintering during the regeneration process.

催化剂支持孔结构的特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳及其整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。这些因素影响焦炭与催化剂表面的相互作用、其在孔内的容纳能力以及对催化剂效率和寿命的影响。例如，较小的孔径可能难以让焦炭顺利移动和容纳，可能导致局部焦炭形成并更易于去除。相反，较大的孔径可能会促进焦炭的扩散，使得控制其沉积更为困难，并导致更广泛且难以移除的焦炭层。

这些关系表明，设计PDH反应的最优和有效催化剂需要仔细考虑孔结构特征。具有精确孔结构特性的催化剂支撑材料可以增强催化剂抵御焦炭形成的能力、提高焦炭去除效率，并维持高转化率和产品产率，这对于确保PDH过程的长期稳定性和经济可行性至关重要。通过材料科学原理，如孔结构工程，可以指导开发具有理想孔特性的催化剂支撑材料，从而推动PDH应用中高效和耐用催化剂的设计。

提出并验证的氧氯化处理方法改善PDH催化剂再生的有效性，归因于其能够增加铂物种的流动性。这种增强的流动性有助于氢还原步骤中更有效的铂颗粒分散，有助于缓解烧焦过程中发生的结块问题，并恢复催化剂的活性。通过控制HCl浓度，研究发现最佳的催化活性恢复是在特定HCl浓度下实现的，这表明在实现最佳催化剂再生过程中精确条件的重要性。因此，氧氯化处理代表了一种有前景的方法，通过促进铂物种的再分散和减轻再生过程中结块的负面影响，来增强PDH催化剂的性能。
