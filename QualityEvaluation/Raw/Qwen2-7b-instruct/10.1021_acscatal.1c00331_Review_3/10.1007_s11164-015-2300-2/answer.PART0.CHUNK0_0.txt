The pore structure characteristics of catalyst support significantly influence the formation, accommodation, and overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of coke formation, its ability to be accommodated within the catalyst matrix, and the impact on catalyst activity. Optimizing these pore structure features can lead to more efficient catalysts with better performance. The design of optimal and effective catalysts should take into account the specific requirements of the PDH reaction, including the need for high propane conversion rates and minimal coke formation. The regeneration process, particularly the use of oxychlorination, aims to enhance the mobility of the precious metal components, such as platinum, which can improve their dispersion and overall activity post-regeneration. This results in a catalyst that can more effectively convert propane to propylene, even after undergoing multiple cycles of use and regeneration. The effectiveness of the regeneration process is often assessed by comparing the performance of the catalyst before and after the process, typically using metrics such as propane conversion rates.

催化剂支撑孔结构特性对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中催化剂的整体性能有重要影响。孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构决定了焦炭形成、其在催化剂基质中的容纳能力以及对催化剂活性的影响。优化这些孔结构特征可以提高催化剂效率，实现更好的性能。设计最佳且有效的催化剂应考虑PDH反应的具体需求，包括高丙烷转化率和焦炭形成最小化。再生过程，尤其是使用氯氧处理，旨在增强贵金属成分（如铂）的流动性，从而改善它们的分散和整体活性，以促进再生后的催化剂更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。再生过程的有效性通常通过比较催化剂再生前后性能来评估，通常使用丙烷转化率等指标。
