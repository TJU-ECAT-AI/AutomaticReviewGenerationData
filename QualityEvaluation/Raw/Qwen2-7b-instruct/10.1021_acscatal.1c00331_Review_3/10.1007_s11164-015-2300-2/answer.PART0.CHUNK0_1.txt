The various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size influences the diffusion of reactants and products, affecting the reaction rate and product selectivity. Connectivity and uniformity of pores enhance the accessibility of reactants and facilitate heat transfer, improving catalytic efficiency. Hierarchical pore structures can accommodate a larger volume of coke while maintaining efficient gas flow, thus influencing the catalyst's stability and activity over multiple cycles. These relationships highlight the importance of designing catalyst supports with optimized pore structures to achieve optimal coke formation control, accommodation, and overall catalytic performance in PDH reactions.
