The pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support structures significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors determine how efficiently the catalysts can convert propane into propylene while minimizing unwanted side reactions. Optimal pore structure design can enhance the catalyst's ability to facilitate the desired chemical transformations, leading to improved selectivity and yield. The implications for designing effective catalysts involve creating pore systems that promote efficient mass transport, optimize the distribution of reactants and products, and minimize the formation of coke, which can deactivate the catalyst over time. This balance is crucial for achieving high productivity and long-term stability in PDH processes.
