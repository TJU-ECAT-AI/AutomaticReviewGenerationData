<p>It is noteworthy that Pt-SBA-15 (in the present study) with an average particle size of around 16 nm shows higher propane conversion and coke formation as compared to Pt-SBA-15-IMP with a particle size of around 21 nm [6]. The results again confirm our previous conclusions on the effect of Pt particle size on the catalytic performance during the DHP reaction. Accordingly, smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective and less stable than the larger particles [6].</p>
<p>The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports is significant on the formation of coke during the DHP reaction (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Despite high conversion of propane over both Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta, the selectivity to coke is markedly different on both the catalysts. The initial selectivity to coke on the former is much higher (0.032%) than that on the latter (0.01%), while it is 0.017% on Pt-SBA-15.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc., which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Whilst, these side reactions may not be significant under these experimental conditions on support Beta. This could explain the higher amount of coke content on catalysts Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15 as compared on Pt-Beta. Therefore, the latter exhibits better stability than the former two catalysts as evidenced by TOFs in Table 2 and conversion profiles in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>Significantly, Pt-ZSM-5 is more stable than Pt-SBA-15 despite containing almost double the amount of coke content (Fig. 3 and Tables 2 and 3). This is further supported by deactivation functions (r/r0), derived from the catalytic data in Fig. 3. The resulting deactivation functions are plotted against the amount of coke formation during the reaction (Fig. 5) to determine the catalyst stability. It can be readily seen that despite high amount of coke formation on Pt-ZSM-5, the relative loss in reaction rate is much lower while it is more significant on Pt-SBA-15 even though the amount of coke deposition is lower.</p>
<p>An attempt to correlate our results with the literature data reported on DHP over a variety of catalysts would be a difficult task due to different catalyst compositions with respect to the active metals and promoters, ratios between Si and Al, reaction mixtures and space velocities. Nonetheless, the most related (to the present study) literature data on DHP over Pt catalysts with different pore geometries are considered in Table 4 to derive correlations between pore geometry of the supports and catalytic performance.</p>

1. The pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Smaller pore sizes, higher connectivity, and more uniform pore structures tend to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst performance. Hierarchical pore structures, combining both micro and mesopores, offer advantages by facilitating efficient reactant molecule-access to active sites while minimizing coke formation. The presence of cation exchange sites in microporous materials like ZSM-5 and Beta can further improve catalyst performance by influencing the selectivity towards propylene.

2. The stability of catalysts in PDH reactions is closely tied to the pore geometry of the support materials. Zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta, with their three-dimensional microporous geometries, exhibit superior stability and catalytic activity compared to mesoporous SBA-15. This is attributed to their intrinsic properties, including cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small pore sizes, which contribute to better accommodation of reactants and active sites, reducing coke formation and enhancing overall catalytic performance.

3. Correlations between pore geometry and catalytic performance in PDH reactions can be challenging to establish due to variations in catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, reaction mixtures, and space velocities across different studies. However, the present study provides direct evidence that three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 and Beta are advantageous for stabilizing Pt and deriving its optimal catalytic activity for PDH. The study supports the notion that zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta can be more attractive support materials than mesoporous SBA-15 for PDH reactions, offering better activity, selectivity to propylene, and stability.

1. 催化剂支撑结构的孔隙大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构显著影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。较小的孔隙尺寸、更高的连通性和更均匀的孔隙结构倾向于减少焦炭形成并增强催化剂性能。结合微孔和介孔的层次孔结构通过有效地将反应物分子引入活性位点，同时减少焦炭形成，从而提供优势，进一步改善催化剂性能。微孔材料如ZSM-5和Beta中存在的阴离子交换位点可以进一步通过影响丙烯选择性来提高催化剂性能。

2. PDH反应中催化剂稳定性与支撑材料的孔几何形状密切相关。具有三维微孔结构的沸石ZSM-5和Beta表现出优于介孔SBA-15的稳定性和催化活性。这归因于其内在特性，包括阴离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小孔尺寸，这些特性有助于更好地容纳反应物和活性位点，减少焦炭形成并增强整体催化性能。

3. 在PDH反应中建立孔几何与催化性能之间的相关性可能由于不同研究中催化剂组成、Si/Al比率、反应混合物和空间速度的变化而变得困难。然而，当前的研究提供了直接证据，证明三维微孔材料如ZSM-5和Beta是用于PDH反应的理想支持材料。该研究支持以下观点：沸石ZSM-5和Beta作为PDH反应的支撑材料比介孔SBA-15更吸引人，它们提供了更好的活性、丙烯选择性和稳定性。
