<p>The catalysts were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation with identical Pt content and with similar Pt dispersion as evidenced by the characterization results.</p>
<p>This largely, though not completely, eliminates the effect of Pt particle size on DHP [6].</p>
<p>It allowed us to investigate exclusively the influence of pore geometry of these three different framework structures on the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta exhibit superior DHP activity, selectivity to propylene and stability than Pt-SBA-15 as evidenced by TEOM results indicating that three dimensional microporous geometries are essential to obtain optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites located within the pores.</p>
<p>The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules.</p>
<p>These properties are largely missing in mesoporous SBA-15, which could attribute to its lower catalytic performance in DHP.</p>

1. The pore geometry of catalyst support structures, specifically the size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements impact the efficiency of reactant molecule access to active sites, the ease of coke formation, and the stability of the catalyst.

2. The interconnectedness and uniformity of pore structures in catalyst supports allow for better accommodation of reactants and products, facilitating efficient PDH reactions. Hierarchical pore arrangements, featuring both micro and mesopores, offer advantages over purely mesoporous materials like SBA-15, enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. The intrinsic properties of microporous materials, including cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small three-dimensional pores, contribute to their superior catalytic activity. These features enable a more effective interaction between active sites and reactant molecules, leading to enhanced PDH performance.

4. The lack of these properties in mesoporous materials like SBA-15 results in lower catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The absence of cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small pore sizes prevents optimal interaction with reactants, leading to reduced activity, selectivity, and stability.

5. In conclusion, the pore geometry of catalyst support materials plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of PDH reactions. Microporous materials with specific structural characteristics, such as those found in ZSM-5 and Beta, offer superior catalytic performance compared to mesoporous materials like SBA-15.

1. 催化剂支撑结构的孔隙几何特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能产生显著影响。孔径、连通性和均匀性影响反应物分子接近活性位点的效率、焦炭形成的便捷性以及催化剂的稳定性。

2. 催化剂支持材料中相互连接和均匀的孔结构允许更好的反应物和产物容纳，促进有效的PDH反应。包含微孔和介孔的层次孔结构相对于纯介孔材料如SBA-15提供优势，增强催化性能。

3. 微孔材料的内在特性，包括阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小型三维孔，对它们的优越催化活性至关重要。这些特征使活性位点与反应物之间更有效互动，导致增强的PDH性能。

4. 缺乏这些特征在介孔材料如SBA-15中导致较低的催化性能。缺乏阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小孔大小阻止最佳与反应物交互，导致活性、选择性和稳定性的降低。

5. 总之，催化剂支撑材料的孔隙几何特性在决定PDH反应的有效性方面起着关键作用。具有特定结构特性的微孔材料（如ZSM-5和Beta），与介孔材料相比，提供更优的催化性能。
