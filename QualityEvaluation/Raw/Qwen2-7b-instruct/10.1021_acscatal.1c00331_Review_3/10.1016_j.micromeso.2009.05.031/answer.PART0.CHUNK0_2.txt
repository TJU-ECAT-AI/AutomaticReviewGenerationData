[1] "The influence of pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activ- ity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously."
[2] "The size of pores in the supports increases in the fol- lowing order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15."
[3] "Moreover, zeolites employed in the present study contain much lower amounts of alumina (Si/Al  300) as compared to that in previous studies (e.g., Si/Al of 55 and 12 in ZSM-5 and Beta, respectively) [1518,21,23], which greatly reduces the role of acidic sites on the catalytic performance."
[4] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation ex- changesites and might be complemented by theirthree dimensional pore geometry."
[5] "Significantly, Pt-ZSM-5 is more stable than Pt-SBA-15 despite containing almost double the amount of coke content (Fig. 3 and Tables 2 and 3)."
[6] "The most related (to the present study) literature data on DHP over Pt catalysts with different pore geometries are considered in Table 4 to derive correlations between pore geometry of the supports and catalytic performance."
[7] "Interestingly, Pt-SBA-15 that showed poor catalytic performance than Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta studied in this work is better than the un-promoted PtH-MOR and PtH-Y [18]."
[8] "When Pt containing microporous zeolites is promoted with an electropositive element, they emerge as the most active and stable catalysts than the large pore zeolites (MOR, Y and L), for example Pt/NaFe-ZSM-5 (Table 4)."

1. The pore geometry of catalyst supports significantly influences the dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene, and coke formation. Zeolites with micro-porous structures (like ZSM-5 and Beta) and mesoporous structures (like SBA-15) were studied in a TEOM reactor, evaluating their performance in terms of reaction products and mass changes.

2. The size of pores in the supports follows the order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15.

3. The study utilized zeolites with significantly lower silica-to-alumina ratios (Si/Al) compared to previous studies, reducing the role of acidic sites in the catalytic process.

4. The catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites, particularly those with three-dimensional pore geometries, originates from the active sites associated with cation exchange sites.

5. Pt-ZSM-5 exhibited better stability than Pt-SBA-15, despite having nearly double the coke content.

6. Literature data on dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts with various pore geometries was compared, establishing correlations between pore structure and catalytic performance.

7. Pt-SBA-15, despite showing poorer performance than Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta, still outperformed un-promoted Pt on MOR and Y zeolites.

8. Promoting Pt containing microporous zeolites with electropositive elements made them the most active and stable catalysts compared to large pore zeolites, as exemplified by Pt/NaFe-ZSM-5.

1. 催化剂支撑孔结构的几何特性显著影响丙烷脱氢（DHP）活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成。研究在TEOM反应器中评估了微孔结构（如ZSM-5和Beta）和介孔结构（如SBA-15）对反应产物和质量变化的影响。

2. 支撑材料中的孔径大小遵循顺序：ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15。

3. 研究使用了与先前研究相比具有显著较低硅/铝比（Si/Al）的沸石，降低了酸性位点在催化过程中的作用。

4. 特别是具有三维孔结构的Pt支持沸石的催化性能来源于与阳离子交换位点关联的活性位点。

5. 尽管具有近两倍的焦炭含量，Pt-ZSM-5的稳定性仍然优于Pt-SBA-15。

6. 对于具有不同孔结构的Pt催化剂的文献数据进行了比较，建立了孔结构和催化性能之间的相关性。

7. 尽管表现出较差的性能，但Pt-SBA-15仍然优于未促进的Pt在MOR和Y沸石上的性能。

8. 通过电正性元素促进含Pt的微孔沸石使它们成为与大孔沸石相比最活跃和稳定的催化剂，例如Pt/NaFe-ZSM-5。
