[1] "The catalysts were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation with identical Pt content and with similar Pt dispersion as evidenced by the characterization results."
[2] "This largely, though not completely, eliminates the effect of Pt particle size on DHP [6]."
[3] "Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta exhibit superior DHP activity, selectivity to propylene and stability than Pt-SBA-15 as evidenced by TEOM results indicating that three dimensional microporous geometries are essential to obtain optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites located within the pores."
[4] "The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules."
[5] "These properties are largely missing in mesoporous SBA-15, which could attribute to its lower catalytic performance in DHP."

1. Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The size, connectivity, and uniformity of pores affect the accessibility of reactants and products, influencing the efficiency of the PDH process. Hierarchical arrangements, or multi-scale porosity, enable better control over the reaction environment, facilitating more effective interactions between active sites and reactants.

2. The pore size, connectivity, and uniformity of the support materials play a critical role in determining the stability and performance of the catalyst in PDH reactions. Smaller pore sizes, enhanced connectivity, and uniformity can lead to improved stability and performance. 

3. The three-dimensional microporous geometries of catalyst supports, like ZSM-5 and Beta, are crucial for achieving optimal catalytic properties of Pt sites. These geometries provide a suitable environment for the active sites, enabling efficient interactions with reactant molecules. 

4. The intrinsic nature of microporous materials, including cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small three-dimensional pores, facilitates the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules. These features enhance the catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

5. Mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15, lack these critical properties. The absence of cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small three-dimensional pores contributes to the lower catalytic performance of these materials in PDH reactions.

1. 催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，包括孔径、连接性、均匀性和层次结构，显著影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。孔径、连接性和均匀性影响反应物和产物的可接近性，影响PDH过程的效率。多层次结构允许更好地控制反应环境，促进活性位点与反应物之间的有效相互作用。

2. 支撑材料的孔径、连接性和均匀性在确定PDH反应中催化剂的稳定性和性能方面起着关键作用。较小的孔径、增强的连接性和均匀性可以提高稳定性和性能。

3. 像ZSM-5和Beta这样的三维微孔几何形状对于实现Pt位点的最优催化性质至关重要。这些几何形状为活性位点提供了一个合适的空间，使得活性位点与反应物分子之间的有效相互作用得以进行。

4. 微孔材料的固有性质，包括阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小三维孔隙，促进了活性位点与反应物分子之间的反应。这些特征提高了PDH反应的催化性能。

5. 水性材料如SBA-15缺乏这些关键特性。缺乏阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小三维孔隙是这些材料在PDH反应中催化性能较低的原因。
