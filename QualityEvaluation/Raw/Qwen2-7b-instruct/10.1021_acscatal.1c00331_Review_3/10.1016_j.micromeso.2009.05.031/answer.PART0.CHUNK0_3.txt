[1] "The pore size in the supports increases in the following order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15."
[2] "The amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."
[3] "The influence of pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor."
[4] "The three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The pore size of the catalyst support materials increases from ZSM-5 to Beta to SBA-15. 
2. The catalyst with the smallest pore size, ZSM-5, forms the most coke during propane dehydrogenation (PDH), while the one with the largest pore size, SBA-15, forms the least coke. This indicates that catalysts with smaller pore sizes exhibit better stability.
3. The pore geometry of the catalyst supports significantly influences the PDH activity, propylene selectivity, and coke formation.
4. Three-dimensional microporous materials are more effective catalyst supports for PDH compared to mesoporous materials like SBA-15 due to their inherent properties that optimize the activity of Pt sites.

1. 催化剂支持材料的孔径从ZSM-5递增到Beta再到SBA-15。
2. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，孔径最小的ZSM-5催化剂形成最多的焦炭，而孔径最大的SBA-15催化剂形成最少的焦炭。这表明具有较小孔径的催化剂表现出更好的稳定性。
3. 催化剂支撑材料的孔隙几何结构对丙烷脱氢（PDH）活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成有显著影响。
4. 三维微孔材料作为PDH的催化支持比微孔材料（如SBA-15）更有效，因为它们内在的特性优化了铂位点的活性。
