<p>The catalysts were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation with identical Pt content and with similar Pt dispersion as evidenced by the characterization results.</p>
<p>This largely, though not completely, eliminates the effect of Pt particle size on DHP [6].</p>
<p>It allowed us to investigate exclusively the influence of pore geometry of these three different framework structures on the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta exhibit superior DHP activity, selectivity to propylene and stability than Pt-SBA-15 as evidenced by TEOM results indicating that three dimensional microporous geometries are essential to obtain optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites located within the pores.</p>
<p>The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules.</p>
<p>These properties are largely missing in mesoporous SBA-15, which could attribute to its lower catalytic performance in DHP.</p>

1. The pore geometry of catalyst support structures, specifically the size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements impact the efficiency of reactant molecule access to active sites, the ease of coke formation, and the stability of the catalyst.

2. The interconnectedness and uniformity of pore structures in catalyst supports allow for better accommodation of reactants and products, facilitating efficient PDH reactions. Hierarchical pore arrangements, featuring both micro and mesopores, offer advantages over purely mesoporous materials like SBA-15, enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. The intrinsic properties of microporous materials, including cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small three-dimensional pores, contribute to their superior catalytic activity. These features enable a more effective interaction between active sites and reactant molecules, leading to enhanced PDH performance.

4. The lack of these properties in mesoporous materials like SBA-15 results in lower catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The absence of cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small pore sizes prevents optimal interaction with reactants, leading to reduced activity, selectivity, and stability.

5. In conclusion, the pore geometry of catalyst support materials plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of PDH reactions. Microporous materials with specific structural characteristics, such as those found in ZSM-5 and Beta, offer superior catalytic performance compared to mesoporous materials like SBA-15.

1. 催化剂支撑结构的孔隙几何特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能产生显著影响。孔径、连通性和均匀性影响反应物分子接近活性位点的效率、焦炭形成的便捷性以及催化剂的稳定性。

2. 催化剂支持材料中相互连接和均匀的孔结构允许更好的反应物和产物容纳，促进有效的PDH反应。包含微孔和介孔的层次孔结构相对于纯介孔材料如SBA-15提供优势，增强催化性能。

3. 微孔材料的内在特性，包括阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小型三维孔，对它们的优越催化活性至关重要。这些特征使活性位点与反应物之间更有效互动，导致增强的PDH性能。

4. 缺乏这些特征在介孔材料如SBA-15中导致较低的催化性能。缺乏阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小孔大小阻止最佳与反应物交互，导致活性、选择性和稳定性的降低。

5. 总之，催化剂支撑材料的孔隙几何特性在决定PDH反应的有效性方面起着关键作用。具有特定结构特性的微孔材料（如ZSM-5和Beta），与介孔材料相比，提供更优的催化性能。

<p>It is noteworthy that Pt-SBA-15 (in the present study) with an average particle size of around 16 nm shows higher propane conversion and coke formation as compared to Pt-SBA-15-IMP with a particle size of around 21 nm [6]. The results again confirm our previous conclusions on the effect of Pt particle size on the catalytic performance during the DHP reaction. Accordingly, smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective and less stable than the larger particles [6].</p>
<p>The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports is significant on the formation of coke during the DHP reaction (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Despite high conversion of propane over both Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta, the selectivity to coke is markedly different on both the catalysts. The initial selectivity to coke on the former is much higher (0.032%) than that on the latter (0.01%), while it is 0.017% on Pt-SBA-15.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc., which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Whilst, these side reactions may not be significant under these experimental conditions on support Beta. This could explain the higher amount of coke content on catalysts Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15 as compared on Pt-Beta. Therefore, the latter exhibits better stability than the former two catalysts as evidenced by TOFs in Table 2 and conversion profiles in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>Significantly, Pt-ZSM-5 is more stable than Pt-SBA-15 despite containing almost double the amount of coke content (Fig. 3 and Tables 2 and 3). This is further supported by deactivation functions (r/r0), derived from the catalytic data in Fig. 3. The resulting deactivation functions are plotted against the amount of coke formation during the reaction (Fig. 5) to determine the catalyst stability. It can be readily seen that despite high amount of coke formation on Pt-ZSM-5, the relative loss in reaction rate is much lower while it is more significant on Pt-SBA-15 even though the amount of coke deposition is lower.</p>
<p>An attempt to correlate our results with the literature data reported on DHP over a variety of catalysts would be a difficult task due to different catalyst compositions with respect to the active metals and promoters, ratios between Si and Al, reaction mixtures and space velocities. Nonetheless, the most related (to the present study) literature data on DHP over Pt catalysts with different pore geometries are considered in Table 4 to derive correlations between pore geometry of the supports and catalytic performance.</p>

1. The pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Smaller pore sizes, higher connectivity, and more uniform pore structures tend to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst performance. Hierarchical pore structures, combining both micro and mesopores, offer advantages by facilitating efficient reactant molecule-access to active sites while minimizing coke formation. The presence of cation exchange sites in microporous materials like ZSM-5 and Beta can further improve catalyst performance by influencing the selectivity towards propylene.

2. The stability of catalysts in PDH reactions is closely tied to the pore geometry of the support materials. Zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta, with their three-dimensional microporous geometries, exhibit superior stability and catalytic activity compared to mesoporous SBA-15. This is attributed to their intrinsic properties, including cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small pore sizes, which contribute to better accommodation of reactants and active sites, reducing coke formation and enhancing overall catalytic performance.

3. Correlations between pore geometry and catalytic performance in PDH reactions can be challenging to establish due to variations in catalyst compositions, Si/Al ratios, reaction mixtures, and space velocities across different studies. However, the present study provides direct evidence that three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 and Beta are advantageous for stabilizing Pt and deriving its optimal catalytic activity for PDH. The study supports the notion that zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta can be more attractive support materials than mesoporous SBA-15 for PDH reactions, offering better activity, selectivity to propylene, and stability.

1. 催化剂支撑结构的孔隙大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构显著影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。较小的孔隙尺寸、更高的连通性和更均匀的孔隙结构倾向于减少焦炭形成并增强催化剂性能。结合微孔和介孔的层次孔结构通过有效地将反应物分子引入活性位点，同时减少焦炭形成，从而提供优势，进一步改善催化剂性能。微孔材料如ZSM-5和Beta中存在的阴离子交换位点可以进一步通过影响丙烯选择性来提高催化剂性能。

2. PDH反应中催化剂稳定性与支撑材料的孔几何形状密切相关。具有三维微孔结构的沸石ZSM-5和Beta表现出优于介孔SBA-15的稳定性和催化活性。这归因于其内在特性，包括阴离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小孔尺寸，这些特性有助于更好地容纳反应物和活性位点，减少焦炭形成并增强整体催化性能。

3. 在PDH反应中建立孔几何与催化性能之间的相关性可能由于不同研究中催化剂组成、Si/Al比率、反应混合物和空间速度的变化而变得困难。然而，当前的研究提供了直接证据，证明三维微孔材料如ZSM-5和Beta是用于PDH反应的理想支持材料。该研究支持以下观点：沸石ZSM-5和Beta作为PDH反应的支撑材料比介孔SBA-15更吸引人，它们提供了更好的活性、丙烯选择性和稳定性。
