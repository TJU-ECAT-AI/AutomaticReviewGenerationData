[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals1."
[2] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation610."
[3] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis1. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH11."
[4] "However, it is difficult to completely isolate Pt atoms by the conventional alloying approach. Single-atom1215 and single-atom alloy11,16 catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt,where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu,respectively."
[5] "For the PdGa system, Pd3 is known to catalyze semihydrogenation of acetylene more selectively than Pd1 (ref. 20)."
[6] "Therefore, we designed Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact (Fig. 1c)."
[7] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C: see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11 for comparison with literatures; deactivation rate constant was defined in Supplementary Note 4)."
[8] "Considering that PtGa (Pt/Ga = 3) gave higher deactivation rate and lower selectivity than PtGa, using 1:1 PtGa phase is a significant factor to develop a highly efficient catalytic system for PDH (Supplementary Fig. 17, Supplementary Table 5)."
[9] "The catalytic performance in PDH is much superior to those of the reported systems."
[10] "The specific crystal structure of intermetallic PtGa providing isolated Pt, its thermal stability, and the large atomic size of Pb enable the remarkably high selectivity and stability even in harsh conditions."

The pore structures of catalyst supports, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature does not provide direct information on how these factors specifically affect coke formation and accommodation. However, it does highlight the importance of maintaining a balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and coke formation, to ensure high selectivity and stability in PDH processes. 

The use of single-atom Pt in intermetallic PtGa supports is a key strategy to achieve this balance. By selectively blocking the threefold Pt sites (Pt3) and keeping the single-atom Pt (Pt1) sites available for the reaction, the catalyst design minimizes side reactions and maximizes propylene selectivity. The stability and selectivity of the catalyst are enhanced by the specific crystal structure of intermetallic PtGa, its inherent thermal stability, and the large atomic size of the modifier Pb. These factors collectively enable the development of a highly efficient catalytic system for PDH, capable of producing propylene continuously and selectively at high temperatures without deactivation.

The use of 1:1 PtGa phase in the catalyst formulation is particularly significant for developing a highly efficient PDH system. This phase ensures that the catalyst maintains high performance and stability, surpassing other reported systems in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity. The combination of the PtGa intermetallic structure, the presence of isolated Pt sites, and the appropriate design of active sites is crucial for achieving the outstanding catalytic properties observed in this study.

In conclusion, the design and synthesis of catalysts for PDH reactions involve optimizing the interactions between the active metal species, the support material, and the pore structures of the support. The interplay between these factors determines the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst, ultimately affecting the overall performance of PDH processes.

催化剂支撑孔结构，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦油形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能产生关键影响。文献没有直接提供这些因素如何具体影响焦油形成和容纳的具体信息。然而，它确实强调了保持丙烯脱氢和可能的副反应（如进一步的CH（C）断裂和随后的焦油形成）之间的平衡对于确保PDH过程中的高选择性和稳定性的重要性。

在单一原子铂（Pt）的使用中，特别是在间金属PtGa支持中，是实现这一平衡的关键策略。通过选择性地封锁三个Pt点（Pt3）并保留单原子Pt（Pt1）点用于反应，催化剂设计最大限度地减少了副反应并最大化了丙烯选择性。通过特定的间金属PtGa晶体结构、其固有的热稳定性和修饰剂Pb的大原子尺寸，催化剂的稳定性和选择性得到了增强。这些因素共同使开发出能够在高温下连续且高度选择性地生产丙烯的高效催化系统成为可能，而无需催化剂失活。

1:1 PtGa相在催化剂配方中的使用特别重要，这对于开发高效的PDH系统至关重要。这种相确保催化剂保持高性能和稳定性，超越其他报道的系统，在催化活性和选择性方面表现出色。PtGa间金属结构的存在、孤立的Pt位点的设计以及活性位点的适当设计对于实现本文研究中观察到的出色催化性质至关重要。

综上所述，PDH反应中催化剂的设计和合成涉及优化活性金属物种、支撑材料和支撑材料的孔结构之间的相互作用。这些因素之间的互动决定了催化剂的效率、选择性和稳定性，最终影响PDH过程的整体性能。
