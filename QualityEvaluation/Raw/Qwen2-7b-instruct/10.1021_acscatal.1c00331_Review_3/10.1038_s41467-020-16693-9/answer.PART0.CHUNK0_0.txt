[1] "The supply of propylene has been reduced because of the recent shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane."
[2] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[3] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[4] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
[5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
[6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[8] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
[9] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites (hereafter signed Pt1, Ga1, Pt3, and Ga3)."
[10] "For the PdGa system, Pd3 is known to catalyze semihydrogenation of acetylene more selectively than Pd1 (ref. 20)."
[11] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
[12] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
[13] "As demonstrated later, the convex Pt1 site is unfavorable geometrically and energetically for Pb deposition."
[14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
[15] "The observed trend agreed also with a relevant system of CO adsorption on PdGa:B(111) monitored by surface science techniques."
[16] "We successfully prepared an ideal catalyst for PDH with single-atom-like isolated Pt without any PtPt ensembles."
[17] "Next, we tested the catalytic performances of the prepared catalysts in PDH at 600 C (Fig. 4)."
[18] "Although PtGa exhibited high conversion and selectivity at the initial stage, conversion gradually decreased below half of its initial value within 50 h."
[19] "Conversely, PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
[20] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
[21] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (3738%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
[22] "Considering that PtGa (Pt/Ga = 3) gave higher deactivation rate and lower selectivity than PtGa, using 1:1 PtGa phase is a significant factor to develop a highly efficient catalytic system for PDH."
[23] "When the modifier for PtGa was changed from Pb to other metals such as In or Sn, no positive effects on activity and selectivity were obtained."
[24] "We also tested the recyclability of PtGaPb catalyst."
[25] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."
[26] "Finally, we investigated the affinity of Pb deposition to several Pt and Ga sites."

1. Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size affects the diffusion of reactants and products, connectivity influences the accessibility of active sites, uniformity ensures consistent reaction rates across the catalyst surface, and hierarchical arrangements can provide a controlled environment for both reactants and products. These factors collectively determine how effectively the catalyst can manage coke formation, accommodate it without deactivating the active sites, and maintain high conversion and selectivity. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include the selection of materials that can provide the right pore structure for the desired reaction conditions, ensuring that the active sites are protected from coke formation, and optimizing the pore architecture to facilitate efficient mass transport.

2. The stability of catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by their ability to resist deactivation due to coke formation and sintering. The design of catalysts that incorporate single-atom Pt in intermetallic compounds, such as PtGa, offers a solution to this challenge. The PtGa system provides thermally stable active sites (Pt1) that are isolated from the rest of the structure, preventing the formation of PtPt ensembles that can lead to coke formation and sintering. By selectively blocking the less desirable active sites (Pt3) with Pb deposition, the catalyst maintains high selectivity and stability, allowing for long-term operation at high temperatures without deactivation. The combination of the PtGa structure and Pb modification enables the isolation and stabilization of active Pt sites, leading to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

3. The selectivity and stability in PDH reactions are influenced by the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Isolating Pt atoms in the catalyst design is a promising strategy to inhibit these side reactions, enhancing both selectivity and stability. The PtGa system, with its isolated Pt1 sites, is particularly effective in minimizing undesired reactions, as the convex Pt1 site is unfavorable for Pb deposition and thus less prone to sintering. This isolation prevents the formation of PtPt ensembles that can lead to coke formation and enhances the selectivity towards propylene production. The use of intermetallic compounds like PtGa, combined with strategic modification techniques such as Pb deposition, allows for the creation of highly selective and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

4. The selectivity and stability of Pt-based catalysts in PDH reactions can be improved by isolating Pt atoms, reducing the formation of PtPt ensembles. The Pt3 sites in the PtGa system are more active for further CH(C) scissions, which can lead to undesired side reactions. By selectively blocking the Pt3 sites with Pb deposition, the catalyst retains the isolated Pt1 sites that are crucial for the selective production of propylene. This modification ensures that the catalyst maintains high selectivity and stability, even at high temperatures where coke formation is a significant concern. The strategic isolation of active sites through the use of intermetallic compounds and selective modification techniques is key to developing highly efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

5. The affinity of Pb deposition to various Pt and Ga sites in the PtGa catalyst system can influence the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions. Pb deposition selectively blocks the less desirable Pt3 sites while preserving the isolated Pt1 sites. The Pb atom does not deposit on the convex Pt1 site due to its unfavorable geometric and energetic conditions, which helps protect this active site from degradation. This selective deposition of Pb ensures that the catalyst maintains high selectivity and stability, as the isolated Pt1 sites are crucial for the selective production of propylene. Understanding the affinity of Pb deposition to different sites within the catalyst structure is essential for optimizing the catalyst design and improving its performance in PDH reactions.

2. PDH反应中催化剂的稳定性受其抵抗焦炭形成和烧结的能力影响。在催化剂设计中融入单原子Pt的互金属化合物，如PtGa，提供了解决这一挑战的方法。PtGa系统提供了热稳定的活性位点（Pt1），这些位点被互金属结构隔离，避免形成可能导致焦炭形成和烧结的PtPt簇。通过选择性地将Pb沉积到较少理想的活性位点（Pt3）上，催化剂保持了高度的选择性和稳定性，允许在高温下进行长时间操作而不发生失活。通过将互金属化合物与Pb修饰结合，可以实现活性Pt位点的有效隔离和稳定化，从而提高PDH反应中的催化性能。

3. PDH反应中的选择性和稳定性受其平衡反应物和副反应（如进一步的CH(C)断裂和随后的焦炭形成）之间的影响。通过隔离Pt原子，可以在催化剂设计中增强选择性和稳定性。在PtGa系统中，孤立的Pt1位点特别有效，因为凸出的Pt1位点不利于Pb沉积，从而减少了活性位点的降解可能性。这种隔离可以防止形成可能导致焦炭形成的PtPt簇，增强丙烯生成的选择性。通过使用如PtGa这样的互金属化合物结合选择性修改技术，可以开发出高度选择性和稳定的催化剂，用于PDH反应。

4. 在PDH反应中，通过隔离Pt原子来改善Pt基催化剂的选择性和稳定性。在PtGa系统中，Pt3位点更活跃于进一步的CH(C)断裂，这可能导致不希望的副反应。通过选择性地阻止Pt3位点的Pb沉积，催化剂保留了关键的孤立Pt1位点，这是选择性生成丙烯所必需的。这种修改确保了催化剂即使在高温下也能保持高选择性和稳定性，因为孤立的Pt1位点是选择性生成丙烯的关键。理解Pb沉积对催化剂结构中不同位点的亲和力对于优化催化剂设计和提高PDH反应性能至关重要。

5. 在PtGa催化剂系统中，Pb沉积对各种Pt和Ga位点的亲和力可以影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能。Pb沉积选择性地阻止了不太理想的Pt3位点，同时保留了孤立的Pt1位点。Pb原子不会沉积在凸出的Pt1位点上，因为其几何和能量条件不利，有助于保护这个活性位点免于降解。这种选择性沉积Pb确保了催化剂保持高选择性和稳定性，因为孤立的Pt1位点是选择性生成丙烯所必需的。了解Pb沉积对催化剂结构中不同位点的亲和力对于优化催化剂设计并提高PDH反应性能至关重要。
