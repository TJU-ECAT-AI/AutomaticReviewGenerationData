[1] "Although Pt3Sn catalyst, the well-known catalyst selective for PDH, gave lower conversion, selectivity, and stability (higher deactivation rate, Supplementary Table 5) than PtGa, highlighting the outstandingly high catalytic performance of PtGaPb."
[2] "We also tested the recyclability of PtGaPb catalyst (Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Fig. 18). The spent PtGaPb catalyst could be regenerated by O2 treatment to recover the original catalytic performance after some induction period."
[3] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol1)18,19 and (2) the atomic radius26 of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."

1. The Pt3Sn catalyst, which is known for its selectivity in PDH, exhibited lower conversion, selectivity, and stability compared to the PtGa catalyst, indicating the exceptional catalytic performance of the PtGaPb system.

2. The PtGaPb catalyst demonstrated recyclability, as the spent catalyst could be regenerated through oxygen treatment, recovering its original catalytic performance after a period of induction.

3. The stability and selectivity of the PtGaPb catalyst can be attributed to the inherent thermodynamic stability of the PtGa intermetallic compound (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ/mol) and the larger atomic radius of lead (Pb), which impedes its diffusion into the bulk of the compound at high temperatures, thus maintaining the integrity of the single-atom Pt sites.

1. Pt3Sn催化剂，因其在PDH中的选择性而知名，其转化率、选择性和稳定性（脱活速率更高）均低于PtGa催化剂，这突显了PtGaPb系统的出色催化性能。

2. PtGaPb催化剂显示出可回收性，通过氧气处理，耗尽的催化剂可以在诱导期后恢复原始的催化性能。

3. PtGaPb催化剂的稳定性和选择性可以归因于PtGa间金属化合物的内在热力学稳定性（ΔHf = 55.6 kJ/mol）和铅的较大原子半径，即使在高温下，这也阻止了铅扩散进入化合物内部，从而保持单原子Pt位点的完整性。
