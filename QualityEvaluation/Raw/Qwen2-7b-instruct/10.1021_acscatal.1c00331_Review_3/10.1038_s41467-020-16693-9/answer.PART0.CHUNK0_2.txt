[1] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation610."
[2] "For instance, alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability1."
[3] "However, it is difficult to completely isolate Pt atoms by the conventional alloying approach."
[4] "Single-atom1215 and single-atom alloy11,16 catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt,where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu,respectively."
[5] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
[6] "For the PdGa system, Pd3 is known to catalyze semihydrogenation of acetylene more selectively than Pd1 (ref. 20)."
[7] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
[8] "As demonstrated later, the convex Pt1 site is unfavorable geometrically and energetically for Pb deposition."
[9] "For PtGa in PDH,however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
[10] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites (hereafter signed Pt1, Ga1, Pt3, and Ga3)."

The pore structures of catalyst supports play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores determine how efficiently the catalyst can manage the conversion of propane to propylene while minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation. Larger pores can facilitate better diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the likelihood of coke formation. However, the pore size should not be too large to prevent the effective interaction between the reactants and catalyst sites. Additionally, the connectivity of the pores ensures a smooth flow of gases, minimizing the chances of localized overheating, which can promote coke formation. Uniformity in pore size and distribution across the catalyst support surface helps maintain consistent catalytic activity and prevents hot spots that can cause rapid deactivation. Hierarchical pore structures, combining both macro- and mesopores, can optimize the balance between reactant diffusion and product removal, enhancing the catalyst's overall performance.

When designing catalysts for PDH, the selection of appropriate support materials with optimized pore structures is critical. The pore structure affects the accommodation of catalyst particles, the diffusion of reactants and products, and the potential for coke formation. By carefully selecting and modifying support materials to achieve a balance between these factors, one can design catalysts that exhibit high selectivity and stability in PDH reactions, effectively converting propane to propylene with minimal side reactions and coke formation.

催化剂支持结构在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中起着至关重要的作用，影响着焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构决定了催化剂如何高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化导致焦炭形成的副反应。较大的孔可以促进反应物和产物的有效扩散，降低焦炭形成的可能性。然而，孔径不宜过大，以防止有效催化剂位点与反应物之间的相互作用。此外，孔的连通性确保了气体的平滑流动，减少了局部过热的风险，这可能导致焦炭形成。孔结构的均匀分布有助于保持一致的催化活性，并防止热点区域的快速失活。层级孔结构，结合宏观和介观孔，可以在反应物扩散和产物移除之间提供最佳平衡，从而增强催化剂的整体性能。

在设计PDH催化剂时，选择具有优化孔结构的支持材料至关重要。孔结构影响催化剂颗粒的容纳、反应物和产物的扩散以及焦炭形成的可能性。通过精心选择和支持材料的设计，实现这些因素之间的平衡，可以设计出高选择性和稳定性的催化剂，在PDH反应中高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化副反应和焦炭形成。
