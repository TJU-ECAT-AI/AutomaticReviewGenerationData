[1] "The supply of propylene has been reduced because of the recent shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane."
[2] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[3] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[4] "Developing a catalyst to meet this demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied chemistry."
[5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
[6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[8] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
[9] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites (hereafter signed Pt1, Ga1, Pt3, and Ga3)."
[10] "For the PdGa system, Pd3 is known to catalyze semihydrogenation of acetylene more selectively than Pd1 (ref. 20)."
[11] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
[12] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
[13] "As demonstrated later, the convex Pt1 site is unfavorable geometrically and energetically for Pb deposition."
[14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
[15] "The observed trend agreed also with a relevant system of CO adsorption on PdGa:B(111) monitored by surface science techniques."
[16] "We successfully prepared an ideal catalyst for PDH with single-atom-like isolated Pt without any PtPt ensembles."
[17] "Next, we tested the catalytic performances of the prepared catalysts in PDH at 600 C (Fig. 4)."
[18] "Although PtGa exhibited high conversion and selectivity at the initial stage, conversion gradually decreased below half of its initial value within 50 h."
[19] "Conversely, PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
[20] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
[21] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (3738%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
[22] "Considering that PtGa (Pt/Ga = 3) gave higher deactivation rate and lower selectivity than PtGa, using 1:1 PtGa phase is a significant factor to develop a highly efficient catalytic system for PDH."
[23] "When the modifier for PtGa was changed from Pb to other metals such as In or Sn, no positive effects on activity and selectivity were obtained."
[24] "We also tested the recyclability of PtGaPb catalyst."
[25] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

1. Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size affects the diffusion of reactants and products, connectivity influences the accessibility of active sites, uniformity ensures consistent reaction rates across the catalyst surface, and hierarchical arrangements can provide a controlled environment for both reactants and products. These factors collectively determine how effectively the catalyst can manage coke formation, accommodate it without deactivating the active sites, and maintain high conversion and selectivity. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts include the selection of materials that can provide the right pore structure for the desired reaction conditions, ensuring that the active sites are protected from coke formation, and optimizing the pore architecture to facilitate efficient mass transport.

2. The stability of catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by their ability to resist deactivation due to coke formation and sintering. The design of catalysts that incorporate single-atom Pt in intermetallic compounds, such as PtGa, offers a solution to this challenge. The PtGa system provides thermally stable active sites (Pt1) that are isolated from the rest of the structure, preventing the formation of PtPt ensembles that can lead to coke formation and sintering. By selectively blocking the less desirable active sites (Pt3) with Pb deposition, the catalyst maintains high selectivity and stability, allowing for long-term operation at high temperatures without deactivation. The combination of the PtGa structure and Pb modification enables the isolation and stabilization of active Pt sites, leading to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

3. The selectivity and stability in PDH reactions are influenced by the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Isolating Pt atoms in the catalyst design is a promising strategy to inhibit these side reactions, enhancing both selectivity and stability. The PtGa system, with its isolated Pt1 sites, is particularly effective in minimizing undesired reactions, as the convex Pt1 site is unfavorable for Pb deposition and thus less prone to sintering. This isolation prevents the formation of PtPt ensembles that can lead to coke formation and enhances the selectivity towards propylene production. The use of intermetallic compounds like PtGa, combined with strategic modification techniques such as Pb deposition, allows for the creation of highly selective and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

4. The selectivity and stability of Pt-based catalysts in PDH reactions can be improved by isolating Pt atoms, reducing the formation of PtPt ensembles. The Pt3 sites in the PtGa system are more active for further CH(C) scissions, which can lead to undesired side reactions. By selectively blocking the Pt3 sites with Pb deposition, the catalyst retains the isolated Pt1 sites that are crucial for the selective production of propylene. This modification ensures that the catalyst maintains high selectivity and stability, even at high temperatures where coke formation is a significant concern. The strategic isolation of active sites through the use of intermetallic compounds and selective modification techniques is key to developing highly efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

5. The affinity of Pb deposition to various Pt and Ga sites in the PtGa catalyst system can influence the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions. Pb deposition selectively blocks the less desirable Pt3 sites while preserving the isolated Pt1 sites. The Pb atom does not deposit on the convex Pt1 site due to its unfavorable geometric and energetic conditions, which helps protect this active site from degradation. This selective deposition of Pb ensures that the catalyst maintains high selectivity and stability, as the isolated Pt1 sites are crucial for the selective production of propylene. Understanding the affinity of Pb deposition to different sites within the catalyst structure is essential for optimizing the catalyst design and improving its performance in PDH reactions.

1. 催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构安排，影响丙烯脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和催化剂整体性能。孔径影响反应物和产物的扩散；连通性影响活性位点的可达性；均匀性确保表面各部分反应速率的一致性；层次结构提供了控制反应物和产物环境的机会。这些因素共同决定了催化剂如何有效管理焦炭形成、防止焦炭在活性位点上的积累，并维持高转化率和选择性。设计高效催化剂时，需要选择能够提供适合反应条件的孔结构材料，确保活性位点不受焦炭形成的影响，优化孔结构以促进有效质量传输。

2. PDH反应中催化剂的稳定性受其抵抗焦炭形成和烧结的能力影响。在催化剂设计中融入单原子Pt的互金属化合物，如PtGa，提供了解决这一挑战的方法。PtGa系统提供了热稳定的活性位点（Pt1），这些位点被互金属结构隔离，避免形成可能导致焦炭形成和烧结的PtPt簇。通过选择性地将Pb沉积到较少理想的活性位点（Pt3）上，催化剂保持了高度的选择性和稳定性，允许在高温下进行长时间操作而不发生失活。通过将互金属化合物与Pb修饰结合，可以实现活性Pt位点的有效隔离和稳定化，从而提高PDH反应中的催化性能。

3. PDH反应中的选择性和稳定性受其平衡反应物和副反应（如进一步的CH(C)断裂和随后的焦炭形成）之间的影响。通过隔离Pt原子，可以在催化剂设计中增强选择性和稳定性。在PtGa系统中，孤立的Pt1位点特别有效，因为凸出的Pt1位点不利于Pb沉积，从而减少了活性位点的降解可能性。这种隔离可以防止形成可能导致焦炭形成的PtPt簇，增强丙烯生成的选择性。通过使用如PtGa这样的互金属化合物结合选择性修改技术，可以开发出高度选择性和稳定的催化剂，用于PDH反应。

4. 在PDH反应中，通过隔离Pt原子来改善Pt基催化剂的选择性和稳定性。在PtGa系统中，Pt3位点更活跃于进一步的CH(C)断裂，这可能导致不希望的副反应。通过选择性地阻止Pt3位点的Pb沉积，催化剂保留了关键的孤立Pt1位点，这是选择性生成丙烯所必需的。这种修改确保了催化剂即使在高温下也能保持高选择性和稳定性，因为孤立的Pt1位点是选择性生成丙烯的关键。理解Pb沉积对催化剂结构中不同位点的亲和力对于优化催化剂设计和提高PDH反应性能至关重要。

5. 在PtGa催化剂系统中，Pb沉积对各种Pt和Ga位点的亲和力可以影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能。Pb沉积选择性地阻止了不太理想的Pt3位点，同时保留了孤立的Pt1位点。Pb原子不会沉积在凸出的Pt1位点上，因为其几何和能量条件不利，有助于保护这个活性位点免于降解。这种选择性沉积Pb确保了催化剂保持高选择性和稳定性，因为孤立的Pt1位点是选择性生成丙烯所必需的。了解Pb沉积对催化剂结构中不同位点的亲和力对于优化催化剂设计并提高PDH反应性能至关重要。

The pore structures of catalyst supports, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature does not provide direct information on how these factors specifically affect coke formation and accommodation. However, it does highlight the importance of maintaining a balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and coke formation, to ensure high selectivity and stability in PDH processes. 

The use of single-atom Pt in intermetallic PtGa supports is a key strategy to achieve this balance. By selectively blocking the threefold Pt sites (Pt3) and keeping the single-atom Pt (Pt1) sites available for the reaction, the catalyst design minimizes side reactions and maximizes propylene selectivity. The stability and selectivity of the catalyst are enhanced by the specific crystal structure of intermetallic PtGa, its inherent thermal stability, and the large atomic size of the modifier Pb. These factors collectively enable the development of a highly efficient catalytic system for PDH, capable of producing propylene continuously and selectively at high temperatures without deactivation.

The use of 1:1 PtGa phase in the catalyst formulation is particularly significant for developing a highly efficient PDH system. This phase ensures that the catalyst maintains high performance and stability, surpassing other reported systems in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity. The combination of the PtGa intermetallic structure, the presence of isolated Pt sites, and the appropriate design of active sites is crucial for achieving the outstanding catalytic properties observed in this study.

In conclusion, the design and synthesis of catalysts for PDH reactions involve optimizing the interactions between the active metal species, the support material, and the pore structures of the support. The interplay between these factors determines the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst, ultimately affecting the overall performance of PDH processes.

催化剂支撑孔结构，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦油形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能产生关键影响。文献没有直接提供这些因素如何具体影响焦油形成和容纳的具体信息。然而，它确实强调了保持丙烯脱氢和可能的副反应（如进一步的CH（C）断裂和随后的焦油形成）之间的平衡对于确保PDH过程中的高选择性和稳定性的重要性。

在单一原子铂（Pt）的使用中，特别是在间金属PtGa支持中，是实现这一平衡的关键策略。通过选择性地封锁三个Pt点（Pt3）并保留单原子Pt（Pt1）点用于反应，催化剂设计最大限度地减少了副反应并最大化了丙烯选择性。通过特定的间金属PtGa晶体结构、其固有的热稳定性和修饰剂Pb的大原子尺寸，催化剂的稳定性和选择性得到了增强。这些因素共同使开发出能够在高温下连续且高度选择性地生产丙烯的高效催化系统成为可能，而无需催化剂失活。

1:1 PtGa相在催化剂配方中的使用特别重要，这对于开发高效的PDH系统至关重要。这种相确保催化剂保持高性能和稳定性，超越其他报道的系统，在催化活性和选择性方面表现出色。PtGa间金属结构的存在、孤立的Pt位点的设计以及活性位点的适当设计对于实现本文研究中观察到的出色催化性质至关重要。

综上所述，PDH反应中催化剂的设计和合成涉及优化活性金属物种、支撑材料和支撑材料的孔结构之间的相互作用。这些因素之间的互动决定了催化剂的效率、选择性和稳定性，最终影响PDH过程的整体性能。

The pore structures of catalyst supports play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores determine how efficiently the catalyst can manage the conversion of propane to propylene while minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation. Larger pores can facilitate better diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the likelihood of coke formation. However, the pore size should not be too large to prevent the effective interaction between the reactants and catalyst sites. Additionally, the connectivity of the pores ensures a smooth flow of gases, minimizing the chances of localized overheating, which can promote coke formation. Uniformity in pore size and distribution across the catalyst support surface helps maintain consistent catalytic activity and prevents hot spots that can cause rapid deactivation. Hierarchical pore structures, combining both macro- and mesopores, can optimize the balance between reactant diffusion and product removal, enhancing the catalyst's overall performance.

When designing catalysts for PDH, the selection of appropriate support materials with optimized pore structures is critical. The pore structure affects the accommodation of catalyst particles, the diffusion of reactants and products, and the potential for coke formation. By carefully selecting and modifying support materials to achieve a balance between these factors, one can design catalysts that exhibit high selectivity and stability in PDH reactions, effectively converting propane to propylene with minimal side reactions and coke formation.

催化剂支持结构在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中起着至关重要的作用，影响着焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构决定了催化剂如何高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化导致焦炭形成的副反应。较大的孔可以促进反应物和产物的有效扩散，降低焦炭形成的可能性。然而，孔径不宜过大，以防止有效催化剂位点与反应物之间的相互作用。此外，孔的连通性确保了气体的平滑流动，减少了局部过热的风险，这可能导致焦炭形成。孔结构的均匀分布有助于保持一致的催化活性，并防止热点区域的快速失活。层级孔结构，结合宏观和介观孔，可以在反应物扩散和产物移除之间提供最佳平衡，从而增强催化剂的整体性能。

在设计PDH催化剂时，选择具有优化孔结构的支持材料至关重要。孔结构影响催化剂颗粒的容纳、反应物和产物的扩散以及焦炭形成的可能性。通过精心选择和支持材料的设计，实现这些因素之间的平衡，可以设计出高选择性和稳定性的催化剂，在PDH反应中高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化副反应和焦炭形成。
