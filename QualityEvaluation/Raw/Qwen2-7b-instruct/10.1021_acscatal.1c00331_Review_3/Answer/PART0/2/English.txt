The pore structures of catalyst supports, specifically pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Smaller pore sizes tend to reduce coke formation and accumulation due to decreased space for coke particles. The connectivity and uniformity of pores affect how easily coke can move through the catalyst, impacting its distribution and reactivity. Hierarchical pore structures, featuring both macropores and mesopores, allow for better dispersion of coke, reducing its impact on catalyst efficiency. The proximity of coke to metal sites on the catalyst surface determines whether the oxidation process is catalyzed or controlled by oxygen mobility on the support material. Catalysts with a metal-support boundary or a support-rich area where coke forms closer to the metal show lower oxidation temperatures due to enhanced catalytic activity. Conversely, coke located far from metal sites is more susceptible to oxygen mobility, affecting its oxidation temperature based on the support's oxygen exchange properties. The results suggest that designing catalysts with optimized pore structures and metal-support interactions can lead to improved PDH performance and effective coke management.
