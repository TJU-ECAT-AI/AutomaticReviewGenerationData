    "Summary": "Both Review A and Review B excel in discussing the comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on PDH reactions. They are equally strong in presenting relevant, accurate, and innovative information, as well as proposing new research directions. However, they lack in-depth methodology assessment and concise expression in writing quality. Both articles are practically valuable, reflecting current research hotspots, and offer feasible suggestions for future catalyst design. Their logical arguments and multi-perspective analyses highlight their critical thinking capabilities. Despite minor differences in specific scores, neither review outperforms the other in this comparison."
