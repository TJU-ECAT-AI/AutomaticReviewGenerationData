In this study, the 3% Pt-Al2O3 catalyst showed different oxidation patterns of coke compared to the 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalyst, despite exhibiting similar catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

This can lead to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes. In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Moreover, hierarchical arrangements of pores could offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, improving the overall catalytic performance. To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This can involve developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst.

The differences in the oxidation patterns are attributed to the unique pore structures and oxygen mobility on the surface of the supports. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in PDH reactions are significant. By understanding how pore structure influences coke formation and oxidation, researchers can tailor catalyst design to minimize coke accumulation and maintain high catalytic activity. For instance, optimizing the pore size and structure of the support can control the location of coke, potentially reducing the oxidation temperature required for coke removal. This can lead to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes. In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Moreover, hierarchical arrangements of pores could offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, improving the overall catalytic performance. To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This can involve developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Additionally, incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4"}
