        The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. As detailed in the study by \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\], these factors are pivotal for the design of optimal and effective catalysts. Specifically, coke formation tends to occur more frequently in catalyst supports with larger pore sizes and lower connectivity. Hierarchical pore structures, on the other hand, can enhance catalyst performance by offering better accommodation for reactants and products. Uniformity in pore size contributes to more consistent catalytic activity across the support surface. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts are profound. By understanding how pore structure influences coke formation and oxidation, researchers can tailor catalyst design to minimize coke accumulation and maintain high catalytic activity. For instance, optimizing the pore size and structure of the support can control the location of coke, potentially reducing the oxidation temperature required for coke removal. This leads to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes. In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes may limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Conversely, larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially facilitating a more effective spillover effect and lowering oxidation temperatures. Hierarchical pore structures, characterized by their multi-level arrangement, can provide multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, thereby improving the overall catalytic performance. To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This involves developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of combining different types of supports or modifying the support's surface chemistry could lead to the creation of highly efficient catalysts with minimized coke formation. These efforts not only aim to improve the catalytic performance of PDH reactions but also pave the way for sustainable and energy-efficient industrial processes, contributing to advancements in the field of green chemistry.
