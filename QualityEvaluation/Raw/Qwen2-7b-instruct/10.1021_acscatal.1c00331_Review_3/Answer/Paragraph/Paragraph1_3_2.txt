            The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors are crucial for the design of optimal and effective catalysts. For instance, coke formation is more likely in catalyst supports with larger pore sizes and lower connectivity, whereas hierarchical pore structures can enhance catalyst performance by providing better accommodation for reactants and products. Uniformity in pore size contributes to more consistent catalytic activity across the support surface.

            The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts in PDH reactions are significant. By understanding how pore structure influences coke formation and oxidation, researchers can tailor catalyst design to minimize coke accumulation and maintain high catalytic activity. Optimizing the pore size and structure of the support can control the location of coke, potentially reducing the oxidation temperature required for coke removal. This leads to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes.

            In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Moreover, hierarchical arrangements of pores could offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, improving the overall catalytic performance.

            To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This can involve developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Additionally, incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

            The study of references \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\] and \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\] has illuminated the complexities of the relationship between catalyst support pore structure and coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions. It highlights the importance of pore structure optimization in the development of efficient and stable catalysts. Future research could focus on exploring the synergistic effects of different pore structure parameters and their impact on catalyst performance, as well as the integration of advanced materials and synthesis techniques to achieve superior catalyst designs.

            催化剂支撑孔结构特性（包括孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构）对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及催化剂整体性能产生显著影响。这些因素对于设计高效的催化剂至关重要。例如，更大孔径和更低连通性的支撑材料更有可能促进焦炭形成，而层级孔结构能够通过提供更好的反应物和产物容纳来增强催化剂性能。孔径大小的一致性有助于在支撑表面实现更加稳定的催化活性。

            设计PDH反应中高效催化剂的含义重大。通过理解孔结构如何影响焦炭形成和氧化，研究人员可以定制催化剂设计以减少焦炭积聚并保持高催化活性。优化支撑材料的孔径和结构可以控制焦炭的位置，从而可能降低去除焦炭所需的氧化温度。这将带来催化剂稳定性、效率的提升，以及再生过程的能源消耗降低。

            在设计PDH反应的催化剂时，需要考虑孔径大小、连通性和均匀性的平衡。较小的孔径可能限制氧物种的扩散，影响扩散效应，从而改变焦炭的氧化温度。更大的孔径可以增强氧扩散，潜在地提高扩散效应的有效性并降低氧化温度。此外，孔结构的层级排列可以提供多条氧扩散路径，从而改善催化剂的整体性能。

            为了达到最佳的催化剂性能，研究者应致力于创建一种支持结构，既允许高效氧扩散，又能最小化焦炭形成和积累。这可能涉及开发具有特定孔结构的材料，如介孔材料，以促进扩散效应而不损害催化剂的完整性。此外，可以通过集成先进的材料合成技术来进一步优化氧物种扩散路径，从而增强催化剂的活性和稳定性。
