        The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors are crucial for the design of optimal and effective catalysts. 

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\] and \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\]. 

        In this study, the 3% Pt-Al2O3 catalyst showed different oxidation patterns of coke compared to the 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalyst, despite exhibiting similar catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The differences in the oxidation patterns are attributed to the unique pore structures and oxygen mobility on the surface of the supports. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in PDH reactions are significant. By understanding how pore structure influences coke formation and oxidation, researchers can tailor catalyst design to minimize coke accumulation and maintain high catalytic activity. For instance, optimizing the pore size and structure of the support can control the location of coke, potentially reducing the oxidation temperature required for coke removal. This can lead to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes.

        In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Moreover, hierarchical arrangements of pores could offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, improving the overall catalytic performance. To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This can involve developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Additionally, incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

        The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, with implications for optimal catalyst design, highlights the importance of pore structure optimization in achieving high-performance catalysts. Future research efforts should focus on exploring new materials and structures that can further enhance catalyst stability, activity, and efficiency.

        催化剂支持孔结构的特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构排列，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。这些因素对于设计高效催化剂至关重要。

        根据\[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\]参考文献的深入分析，从\[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\]和\[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\]的参考文献中整合了综合理解。

        在这项研究中，3% Pt-Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的焦炭氧化模式与3% Pt-SBA-15催化剂不同，尽管表现出相似的催化性能。焦炭氧化模式的差异归因于支撑表面独特的孔结构和氧活性物种的移动性。这些关系对于PDH反应中设计高效催化剂的深远意义在于：通过理解孔结构如何影响焦炭形成和氧化，研究人员可以定制催化剂设计以减少焦炭积聚并保持高催化活性。例如，优化支持材料的孔径和结构可以控制焦炭的位置，从而降低焦炭去除所需的氧化温度。这可以提高催化剂稳定性、效率，并降低再生过程的能量消耗。

        在设计PDH反应催化剂时，必须考虑孔径、连通性和均匀性的平衡。较小的孔径可能限制氧物种的扩散，影响溢出效应，从而影响焦炭的氧化温度。较大的孔径可以增强氧扩散，可能实现更有效的溢出效应和更低的氧化温度。此外，孔结构的层次排列可以提供多种氧扩散途径，改善整体催化性能。为了实现最佳催化剂性能，研究人员应致力于创建允许有效氧扩散同时减少焦炭形成和积累的支持材料。这可能涉及开发具有特定孔结构的材料，如介孔支持体，以促进溢出效应而不损害催化剂的完整性。此外，可以通过引入周期性或各向异性等特征来进一步优化氧物种的扩散路径，从而增强催化剂的活性和稳定性。
