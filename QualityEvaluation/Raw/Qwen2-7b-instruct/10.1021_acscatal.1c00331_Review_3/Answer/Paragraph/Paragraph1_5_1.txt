        The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors are crucial for the design of optimal and effective catalysts. The study referenced by DOI 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001 elucidates that catalyst support pore structures notably influence coke formation and the overall performance of PDH reactions, underscoring the importance of pore structure optimization in catalyst design. The hierarchical pore structures are shown to enhance catalyst performance by facilitating better accommodation for reactants and products. Uniformity in pore size contributes to more consistent catalytic activity across the support surface, ensuring a more stable and efficient reaction process.

        Various studies, including those referenced by DOI 10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4, have demonstrated that coke formation is more likely in catalyst supports with larger pore sizes and lower connectivity. This finding is critical as it guides the selection and modification of support materials to minimize coke accumulation. The study also highlights the role of oxygen mobility and its impact on coke oxidation temperatures, indicating that the unique pore structures and oxygen mobility on the surface of the supports significantly affect the catalytic activity and the oxidation temperature of coke.

        In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is essential to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, potentially affecting the spillover effect and the oxidation temperature of coke. Conversely, larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Hierarchical arrangements of pores offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, which can improve the overall catalytic performance of the catalyst.

        To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This can involve developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

        The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in PDH reactions are significant. By understanding how pore structure influences coke formation and oxidation, researchers can tailor catalyst design to minimize coke accumulation and maintain high catalytic activity. This leads to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes. Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies that leverage the insights gained from studying catalyst support pore structures to further enhance PDH catalyst performance.
