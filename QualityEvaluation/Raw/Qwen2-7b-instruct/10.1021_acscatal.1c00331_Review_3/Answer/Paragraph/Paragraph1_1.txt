            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4\], \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\], and \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09736.s001\]. The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors are crucial for the design of optimal and effective catalysts. Various studies have shown that coke formation is more likely in catalyst supports with larger pore sizes and lower connectivity. Hierarchical pore structures can enhance catalyst performance by providing better accommodation for reactants and products. Uniformity in pore size contributes to more consistent catalytic activity across the support surface. The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include considering the specific pore structure characteristics of the support material.

            The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is profound. The pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support material play pivotal roles in determining the efficiency of the catalyst. Larger pore sizes and lower connectivity tend to facilitate coke formation, which can lead to decreased catalytic activity and shortened catalyst life. On the other hand, hierarchical pore structures, characterized by multi-level porosity, can improve the accommodation of reactants and products, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Uniformity in pore size ensures a more consistent catalytic activity across the support surface, which is essential for maintaining high efficiency throughout the reaction process.

            In the context of propane dehydrogenation, understanding the intricate relationship between pore structure characteristics and coke formation is crucial for the development of optimal catalysts. Researchers must consider the specific pore structure characteristics of the support material when designing catalysts for PDH reactions. This includes tailoring the pore size, connectivity, and uniformity to minimize coke formation and accumulation, while maximizing the efficiency of oxygen diffusion and the spillover effect. By doing so, the oxidation temperature of coke can be reduced, leading to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption during the regeneration process.

            To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This involves developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

            In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is also crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Conversely, larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Hierarchical arrangements of pores can offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, which can improve the overall catalytic performance.

            The insights gained from these studies provide a comprehensive framework for the design of catalysts with optimized pore structures for PDH reactions. By leveraging our understanding of the complex interplay between pore structure characteristics and coke formation, we can engineer catalysts that effectively minimize coke accumulation, maintain high catalytic activity, and reduce energy consumption during the regeneration process. This not only enhances the economic viability of PDH processes but also paves the way for the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly industrial practices.

            在丙烷脱氢反应中，催化剂支持孔结构特征对焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的影响是全面而深远的。孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构在决定催化剂效率方面起着关键作用。较大的孔径和较低的连通性倾向于促进焦炭形成，这可能导致催化活性下降和催化剂寿命缩短。另一方面，层级孔结构，以多层次孔隙为特征，可以改善反应物和产物的容纳，从而增强催化剂性能。均匀的孔径确保了支持表面的一致催化活性，这对于维持整个反应过程中的高效率至关重要。

            理解丙烷脱氢过程中孔结构特征与焦炭形成之间的复杂关系对于开发最优催化剂至关重要。研究人员在设计PDH反应催化剂时必须考虑支持材料的具体孔结构特性。这包括调整孔径、连通性和均匀性，以最小化焦炭形成和积累，并最大化氧气扩散和溢出效应的效率。通过这样做，可以降低焦炭的氧化温度，从而提高催化剂稳定性、效率，并降低再生过程中的能量消耗。

            实现最优催化剂性能需要创建一个允许高效氧气扩散并同时减少焦炭形成和积累的支持。这涉及到开发具有特定孔结构的材料，如介孔支持，以促进溢出效应而不损害催化剂的完整性。还可以通过在孔结构中引入周期性或各向异性等特征进一步优化氧气物种的扩散路径，从而增强催化剂的活性和稳定性。
