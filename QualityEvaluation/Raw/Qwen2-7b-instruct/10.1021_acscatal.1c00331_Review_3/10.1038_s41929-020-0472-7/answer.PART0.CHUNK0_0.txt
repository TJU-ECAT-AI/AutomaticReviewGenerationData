The pore structures of the catalyst support, specifically the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of Pt and Sn species in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite significantly enhances the PDH performance. The PtSn clusters are predominantly located in these channels, which contributes to their high stability and activity. Additionally, the coke formation and accommodation patterns suggest that the pore structure's characteristics determine how effectively the catalyst can resist coke buildup, thereby affecting its lifetime and efficiency. The design of optimal catalysts for PDH reactions should consider the pore structure's influence on coke formation and accommodation, aiming for configurations that minimize coke deposition and maximize catalyst longevity and activity.

The specific activities of the catalysts were calculated using the double isotherm method on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C instrument, providing insights into the dispersion of the Pt species. The analysis of coke formation involved thermo-gravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy, offering detailed information about the coke's physical and chemical properties. The location of the PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of MFI zeolite is a key factor in the superior performance of the catalysts, indicating that the confinement effect within these specific pore structures is highly beneficial for PDH reactions.
