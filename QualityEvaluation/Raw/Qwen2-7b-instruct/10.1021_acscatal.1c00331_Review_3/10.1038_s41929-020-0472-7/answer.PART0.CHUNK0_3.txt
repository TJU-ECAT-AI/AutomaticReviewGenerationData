The pore structures of the catalyst support play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores affect how easily coke can form and deposit on the catalyst surface. In this study, it was found that the Pt and Sn species confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of the MFI zeolite had superior performance in PDH reactions. This suggests that the pore structure of the support significantly influences the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. By comparing the initial reactivity of the catalyst with reported literature data, it was evident that the confined Pt-Sn clusters had enhanced performance, which is likely due to the optimized pore structure facilitating efficient coke management and maintaining active sites.

The specific activities of the catalyst were calculated using the initial activities shown in the referenced figures. The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples was also inferred from CO chemisorption results. This indicates that the specific pore structure and the confinement of the metals within these pores contribute to the catalyst's high performance in PDH reactions.

催化剂支撑的孔结构对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构会影响焦炭如何容易地形成并沉积在催化剂表面。在此研究中，发现被限制在MFI沸石的螺旋10R通道中的Pt和Sn物种在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能。这表明支撑的孔结构显著影响催化活性和催化剂稳定性。通过将催化剂的初始反应性与文献报道的数据进行比较，可以清楚地看出受限的Pt-Sn簇具有增强的性能，这可能归因于优化的孔结构有助于有效管理焦炭并保持活性位点。

催化剂的具体活性是使用参考图中的初始活性计算得出的。从CO化学吸附结果可以推断出，减少了K-PtSn@MFI样品中的Pt簇与部分还原的Sn物种相互作用。这表明特定孔结构和金属在这些孔内的限制对催化剂在PDH反应中的高性能有贡献。
