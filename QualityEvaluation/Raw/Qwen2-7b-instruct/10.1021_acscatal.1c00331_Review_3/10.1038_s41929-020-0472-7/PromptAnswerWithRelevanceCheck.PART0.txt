The pore structures of the catalyst support, specifically the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of Pt and Sn species in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite significantly enhances the PDH performance. The PtSn clusters are predominantly located in these channels, which contributes to their high stability and activity. Additionally, the coke formation and accommodation patterns suggest that the pore structure's characteristics determine how effectively the catalyst can resist coke buildup, thereby affecting its lifetime and efficiency. The design of optimal catalysts for PDH reactions should consider the pore structure's influence on coke formation and accommodation, aiming for configurations that minimize coke deposition and maximize catalyst longevity and activity.

The specific activities of the catalysts were calculated using the double isotherm method on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C instrument, providing insights into the dispersion of the Pt species. The analysis of coke formation involved thermo-gravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy, offering detailed information about the coke's physical and chemical properties. The location of the PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of MFI zeolite is a key factor in the superior performance of the catalysts, indicating that the confinement effect within these specific pore structures is highly beneficial for PDH reactions.

The pore structures of the catalyst support play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores affect how easily coke can form and deposit on the catalyst surface. In this study, it was found that the Pt and Sn species confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of the MFI zeolite had superior performance in PDH reactions. This suggests that the pore structure of the support significantly influences the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. By comparing the initial reactivity of the catalyst with reported literature data, it was evident that the confined Pt-Sn clusters had enhanced performance, which is likely due to the optimized pore structure facilitating efficient coke management and maintaining active sites.

The specific activities of the catalyst were calculated using the initial activities shown in the referenced figures. The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples was also inferred from CO chemisorption results. This indicates that the specific pore structure and the confinement of the metals within these pores contribute to the catalyst's high performance in PDH reactions.

催化剂支撑的孔结构对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能产生重要影响。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构会影响焦炭如何容易地形成并沉积在催化剂表面。在此研究中，发现被限制在MFI沸石的螺旋10R通道中的Pt和Sn物种在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能。这表明支撑的孔结构显著影响催化活性和催化剂稳定性。通过将催化剂的初始反应性与文献报道的数据进行比较，可以清楚地看出受限的Pt-Sn簇具有增强的性能，这可能归因于优化的孔结构有助于有效管理焦炭并保持活性位点。

催化剂的具体活性是使用参考图中的初始活性计算得出的。从CO化学吸附结果可以推断出，减少了K-PtSn@MFI样品中的Pt簇与部分还原的Sn物种相互作用。这表明特定孔结构和金属在这些孔内的限制对催化剂在PDH反应中的高性能有贡献。

The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports play a significant role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores determine how easily coke can form, accumulate, and affect the catalyst's efficiency. Smaller, more interconnected, and uniformly distributed pores tend to hinder coke formation by reducing the surface area available for coke deposition. Hierarchical pore structures, which combine macropores with mesopores and micropores, can accommodate a wider range of coke sizes, potentially affecting the reaction pathways and deactivation rates. The optimal pore structure for PDH catalysts depends on balancing the need for high surface area to support active sites with the requirement to minimize coke formation. Designing catalysts with tailored pore architectures could lead to improved performance and longevity in PDH applications.

The interaction between Pt and Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The number of Sn atoms that interact with the Pt clusters must be carefully controlled to achieve the desired balance between Pt activity and selectivity. When the Sn atoms interact with the external surface of Pt clusters, it can modify the electronic structure of Pt, enhancing its selectivity towards propylene formation while minimizing hydrogenolysis and coke formation. This interaction also affects the size and stability of the Pt clusters, which are key factors in determining the overall catalytic activity and lifetime. The precise control of Sn atom interactions is essential for optimizing the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions.

The optimized conditions developed in the current work for activating the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst lead to a significant improvement in its performance compared to previous methods. By increasing the pre-reduction time at 600°C from 1 hour to 22 hours, the deactivation constant decreased by a factor of seven. This improvement suggests that a longer reduction treatment facilitates the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species, which exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions. The extended lifetime of the catalysts treated under these optimized conditions indicates a more efficient use of the active sites and a reduced risk of deactivation due to coke formation or other detrimental effects. The ability to tailor the catalyst's performance by adjusting the reduction time highlights the importance of understanding the detailed mechanisms governing the interaction between Pt and Sn species and their impact on the catalyst's overall behavior in PDH reactions.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭形成、容纳及其整体催化剂性能具有重要影响。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构决定了焦炭形成的易度、积聚方式以及催化剂效率。更小、更连通且分布均匀的孔有助于减少焦炭沉积的表面面积，从而抑制焦炭形成。具有分层次孔结构（结合大孔、介孔和微孔）的催化剂能够容纳不同大小的焦炭，可能会影响反应路径和失活速率。PDH催化剂的理想孔结构需要在提供大量表面积以支撑活性位点与减少焦炭沉积之间取得平衡。设计具有定制孔结构的催化剂可能会带来改进的性能和更长的使用寿命。

Pt和Sn物种在还原的K-PtSn@MFI样品中的相互作用对于实现PDH反应的最佳催化性能至关重要。与Pt簇相互作用的Sn原子的数量必须得到精确控制，以达到理想的活性与选择性的平衡。当Sn原子与Pt簇的外部表面相互作用时，它可以修改Pt的电子结构，增强其丙烯形成的选择性，同时最小化氢解离和焦炭形成。这种相互作用还影响Pt簇的尺寸和稳定性，这是决定整体催化活性和寿命的关键因素。精确控制Sn原子的相互作用是优化催化剂性能的关键。

当前工作开发的激活K-PtSn@MFI催化剂的优化条件相对于先前的方法带来了显著改进。通过将预还原时间从600°C的1小时增加到22小时，失活常数减少了七倍。这一改进表明，更长时间的还原处理促进了次纳米级Pt簇与部分还原的SnOx物种修饰的形成，这些簇表现出高活性、高选择性和稳定性，适用于PDH反应。催化剂在这些优化条件下处理后延长的寿命表明了活性位点更有效的利用和降低由于焦炭形成或其他不利影响导致的失活风险。通过调整还原时间来定制催化剂性能的能力突显了理解Pt和Sn物种之间的详细机制及其对催化剂整体行为影响的重要性。
