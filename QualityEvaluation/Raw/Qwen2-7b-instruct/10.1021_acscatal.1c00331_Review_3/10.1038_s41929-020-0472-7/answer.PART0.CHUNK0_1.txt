1. Introducing hydrogen during the process might lead to slower deactivation and a longer operational lifetime, albeit with a trade-off in equilibrium conversion efficiency.

2. The specific activities were determined by applying the initial activity values shown in figures a through f.

3. The modifications in CO absorption spectra within the range of 1,850 to 1,650 cm−1 reflect the formation of interactions between Pt clusters and partially reduced Sn species during hydrogen treatment.

4. The optimized activation procedures developed in this research resulted in a sevenfold reduction in the deactivation rate compared to our earlier work, which utilized hydrogen reduction for 1 hour at 600°C.

5. The coke accumulation in all samples stayed below 1 wt%, yet no link was identified between stability and the quantity of deposited coke.

1. 如果引入氢气，可以预期更慢的降解和更长的使用寿命，尽管这可能会牺牲平衡转化率。

2. 特定的活性是通过将a至f中的初始活动值应用于计算得到的。

3. 在1,850到1,650 cm−1的范围内，CO吸收光谱的变化反映了氢处理过程中Pt簇与部分还原Sn物种之间的相互作用形成。

4. 与先前在氢中进行1小时600°C还原的工作相比，本研究开发的优化激活过程导致了七倍的降解速率降低。

5. 所有样品中的焦炭积累量均低于1 wt%，但未发现稳定性与沉积焦炭量之间的相关性。
