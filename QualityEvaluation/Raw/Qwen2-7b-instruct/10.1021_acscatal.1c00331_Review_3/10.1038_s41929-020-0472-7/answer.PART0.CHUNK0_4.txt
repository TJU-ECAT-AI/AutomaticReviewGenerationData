[1] "Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion."
[2] "We note that the number of Sn atoms interacting with the Pt clusters must be low, which causes the absence of a PtSn contribution in the EXAFS spectra and a Pt dispersion of 30% in the K-PtSn@ MFI-600H2-22h sample."
[3] "When the K-PtSn@MFI sample was pre-reduced with H2 for a longer time of 22h (see Fig. 7f), a slight decrease in the initial activity was observed, but high initial selectivity and very slow deactivation were achieved."
[4] "These results confirm the critical role of Sn in improving the selectivity to propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The specific activities were calculated using the initial activities shown in af."
[6] "Compared with our previous work (catalyst activated by reduction for 1h at 600C in H2)17, the optimized acti- vation conditions developed in the current work lead to a sevenfold decrease in the deactivation constant."

The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports play a significant role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the pores determine how easily coke can form, accumulate, and affect the catalyst's efficiency. Smaller, more interconnected, and uniformly distributed pores tend to hinder coke formation by reducing the surface area available for coke deposition. Hierarchical pore structures, which combine macropores with mesopores and micropores, can accommodate a wider range of coke sizes, potentially affecting the reaction pathways and deactivation rates. The optimal pore structure for PDH catalysts depends on balancing the need for high surface area to support active sites with the requirement to minimize coke formation. Designing catalysts with tailored pore architectures could lead to improved performance and longevity in PDH applications.

The interaction between Pt and Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The number of Sn atoms that interact with the Pt clusters must be carefully controlled to achieve the desired balance between Pt activity and selectivity. When the Sn atoms interact with the external surface of Pt clusters, it can modify the electronic structure of Pt, enhancing its selectivity towards propylene formation while minimizing hydrogenolysis and coke formation. This interaction also affects the size and stability of the Pt clusters, which are key factors in determining the overall catalytic activity and lifetime. The precise control of Sn atom interactions is essential for optimizing the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions.

The optimized conditions developed in the current work for activating the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst lead to a significant improvement in its performance compared to previous methods. By increasing the pre-reduction time at 600°C from 1 hour to 22 hours, the deactivation constant decreased by a factor of seven. This improvement suggests that a longer reduction treatment facilitates the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species, which exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions. The extended lifetime of the catalysts treated under these optimized conditions indicates a more efficient use of the active sites and a reduced risk of deactivation due to coke formation or other detrimental effects. The ability to tailor the catalyst's performance by adjusting the reduction time highlights the importance of understanding the detailed mechanisms governing the interaction between Pt and Sn species and their impact on the catalyst's overall behavior in PDH reactions.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭形成、容纳及其整体催化剂性能具有重要影响。孔的大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构决定了焦炭形成的易度、积聚方式以及催化剂效率。更小、更连通且分布均匀的孔有助于减少焦炭沉积的表面面积，从而抑制焦炭形成。具有分层次孔结构（结合大孔、介孔和微孔）的催化剂能够容纳不同大小的焦炭，可能会影响反应路径和失活速率。PDH催化剂的理想孔结构需要在提供大量表面积以支撑活性位点与减少焦炭沉积之间取得平衡。设计具有定制孔结构的催化剂可能会带来改进的性能和更长的使用寿命。

Pt和Sn物种在还原的K-PtSn@MFI样品中的相互作用对于实现PDH反应的最佳催化性能至关重要。与Pt簇相互作用的Sn原子的数量必须得到精确控制，以达到理想的活性与选择性的平衡。当Sn原子与Pt簇的外部表面相互作用时，它可以修改Pt的电子结构，增强其丙烯形成的选择性，同时最小化氢解离和焦炭形成。这种相互作用还影响Pt簇的尺寸和稳定性，这是决定整体催化活性和寿命的关键因素。精确控制Sn原子的相互作用是优化催化剂性能的关键。

当前工作开发的激活K-PtSn@MFI催化剂的优化条件相对于先前的方法带来了显著改进。通过将预还原时间从600°C的1小时增加到22小时，失活常数减少了七倍。这一改进表明，更长时间的还原处理促进了次纳米级Pt簇与部分还原的SnOx物种修饰的形成，这些簇表现出高活性、高选择性和稳定性，适用于PDH反应。催化剂在这些优化条件下处理后延长的寿命表明了活性位点更有效的利用和降低由于焦炭形成或其他不利影响导致的失活风险。通过调整还原时间来定制催化剂性能的能力突显了理解Pt和Sn物种之间的详细机制及其对催化剂整体行为影响的重要性。
