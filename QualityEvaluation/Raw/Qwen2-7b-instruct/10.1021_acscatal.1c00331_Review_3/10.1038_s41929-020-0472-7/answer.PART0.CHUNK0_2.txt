1. The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may differ from those of nanoparticles on open-structure carriers, leading to unique reactivity. 

2. In the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, Sn is inferred to be in the Sn(iv) state, as evidenced by the prominent white line in the XANES spectra (Fig. 2c).

3. The Pt clusters in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are found to be within the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600°C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 11-16).

4. The deactivation constants for the various K-PtSn@MFI catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600°C were calculated using the formula: ln[(1Xfinal)/Xfinal]=kd×T+ln[(1Xintial)/Xintial], where Xfinal and Xinitial are the final and initial propane conversions, respectively, T is the lifetime of the catalyst measured in the catalytic test, and kd is the deactivation constant.

1. 纳米尺度的双金属簇在受限空间中的几何和电子结构可能与开放载体上的纳米粒子不同，这可能导致独特的活性。

2. 在原始的K-PtSn@MFI-Air样品中，Sn被推断为处于Sn(iv)状态，这是通过XANES光谱中的明显白色线（图2c）来指示的。

3. 无论H2在600°C下的还原时间如何，减少后的K-PtSn@MFI样品中的Pt簇都位于10R正弦通道内（图1et及补充图11-16）。

4. 使用公式：ln[(1Xfinal)/Xfinal]=kd×T+ln[(1Xintial)/Xintial]计算了各种K-PtSn@MFI催化剂在600°C下丙烷脱氢反应过程中的失活常数，其中Xfinal和Xinitial分别是最终和初始丙烷转化率，T是催化剂在催化试验中的寿命，kd是失活常数。
