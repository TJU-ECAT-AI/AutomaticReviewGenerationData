1. The document highlights that isolated Pt atoms in the metallic state are promising active sites for alkane dehydrogenation at high temperatures, with the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst showing improved performance over Pt nanoparticles.

2. The CH activation starts at 188 C on Pt nanoparticles, 204 C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 C on Cu nanoparticles, indicating that Pt/Cu SAA has a lower activation energy for CH bond activation.

3. The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times higher than that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, with an improvement in selectivity from 70% to 90%.

4. The thermodynamic conversion of the catalyst is represented graphically as a dashed line for comparison purposes.

5. The Raman spectra show an increase in the ID/IG ratio, indicating a higher degree of dehydrogenation of coke on the catalysts in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3.

6. The same parameters are used for the nanoparticle calculations, except the k-points grid is reduced to Γ point for efficiency.

1. 文献强调孤立的铂原子在金属状态是高温度下烷烃脱氢反应的有前景活性位点，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂显示出相对于铂纳米粒子的改进性能。

2. CH活化在铂纳米粒子上开始于188°C，在Pt/Cu SAA上为204°C，在铜纳米粒子上为298°C，表明Pt/Cu SAA对CH键活化的能量更低。

3. 对于0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3催化剂，初始丙烯形成速率比0.1Pt/Al2O3高3.2倍，同时丙烯选择性从70%提高到90%，在13.1%转化率下相比5.8%转化率下的0.1Pt/Al2O3。

4. 催化剂的热动力学转化以每克铂每小时摩尔数的形式表示，作为虚线进行比较。

5. Raman光谱显示ID/IG比率的增加，表明在催化剂上的焦炭脱氢程度按顺序递增：0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3。

6. 对纳米粒子计算应用相同的参数，除了k点网格被减少到Γ点以提高效率。
