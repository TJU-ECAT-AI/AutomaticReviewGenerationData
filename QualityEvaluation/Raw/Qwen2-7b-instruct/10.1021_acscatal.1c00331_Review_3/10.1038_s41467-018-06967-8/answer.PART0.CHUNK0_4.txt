<p>Note that we also calculated the relative stability of Pt/Ag SAA surfaces, and the single Pt atom is always slightly more stable at subsurface instead of surface.

1. The Pt/Ag SAA surfaces have a similar dehydrogenation barrier to Pt/Cu(111) SAA surfaces, but the catalytic activity for Pt/Ag(111) might be lower due to fewer exposed surface Pt atoms over Ag.
2. The lattice spacing of Pt/Cu SAA is consistent with that of Cu(111), suggesting a dilute dispersion of Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles.
3. The oxide species of Pt and Cu on γ-alumina can be fully reduced under H2-rich conditions at 600 C for 1 hour, as the highest reduction peak temperature for PtCu bimetallic catalysts is below 200 C.
4. The initial propylene formation rate for the 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is 3.2 times higher than that for the 0.1Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, with an improved selectivity to propylene of 90% compared to 70% for the 0.1Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
5. The thermodynamic conversion of the catalysts is presented as mole g<sup>-1</sup>Pt h<sup>-1</sup>.
6. The CO linearly adsorbed on Pt shifts from 2068 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 2044 cm<sup>-1</sup> and then stabilizes at 2018 cm<sup>-1</sup> as the Cu content increases.
7. The lattice spacing of Pt/Cu SAA matches that of Cu(111), indicating a dilute dispersion of Pt atoms within Cu nanoparticles.

1. Pt/Ag SAA表面的脱氢化壁垒与Pt/Cu(111) SAA表面相似，但Pt/Ag(111)的催化活性可能较低，因为Ag表面的Pt原子暴露较少。
2. Pt/Cu SAA的晶格间距与Cu(111)相匹配，表明Pt原子在Cu纳米粒子中的稀疏分散。
3. 在600°C的H2富集条件下，对γ-Al2O3的Pt和Cu氧化物可以完全还原，因为PtCu双金属催化剂的最大还原峰温度低于200°C。
4. 与0.1Pt/Al2O3催化剂相比，0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3催化剂的初始丙烯形成速率提高了3.2倍，丙烯选择性从5.8%提高到13.1%时达到90%。
5. 催化剂的热力学转换以每克铂每小时的摩尔数表示。
6. 随着Cu含量增加，CO线性吸附于Pt的波长从2068 cm<sup>-1</sup>逐渐降至2044 cm<sup>-1</sup>，然后稳定在2018 cm<sup>-1</sup>。
7. Pt/Cu SAA的晶格间距与Cu(111)相匹配，表明Pt原子在Cu纳米粒子中的稀疏分散。
