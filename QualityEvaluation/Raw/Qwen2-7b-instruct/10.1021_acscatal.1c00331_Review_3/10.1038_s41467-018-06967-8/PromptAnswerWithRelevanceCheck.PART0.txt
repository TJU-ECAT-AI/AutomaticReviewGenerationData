[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity."
[3] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10."
[4] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehy- drogenation of propane11."
[5] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently12."
[6] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis13."
[7] "A large number of single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit distinct and often outstanding performances in a broad scope of chemical reactions, such as CO oxidation14,15, water-gas shift reaction (WGS)1618, methanol steam reforming (MSR)19,20, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)2123, hydrogenation of substituted nitroarenes24,25, hydrogenation of alkynes and dienes2629, and hydrogenation of carbon dioxide3032."
[8] "However, SACs do not find broad applica- tion in high temperature (> 500 C) light alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[9] "To the best of our knowledge, high stability and selectivity have not been achieved for the PDH reaction with the use of single-atom Pt catalysts."
[10] "Herein, we report that Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during the PDH, with a great improvement of propylene selectivity and a slight loss of intrinsic dehydrogenation activity."
[11] "Based on the theoretical analysis, we design and synthesize the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina via an atomic dilution method and confirm the formation of Pt/Cu SAA through detailed characterizations, such as CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (CO-DRIFTS), aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF- STEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra."
[12] "Subsequent catalytic tests demonstrate the transferability from DFT calculations to practical catalytic reaction and the Pt/ Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520 C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1."
[13] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications26,29,3739, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."

The various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors can affect how effectively the catalyst can maintain its activity and selectivity over time. In the context of PDH, the PtM alloys, including PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu, typically exhibit limited improvement in both activity and selectivity due to the existence of the scaling relationship. This relationship often leads to a trade-off where enhancing the selectivity towards propylene comes at the cost of reduced intrinsic dehydrogenation activity.

Developing catalysts that can break this scaling relationship, thereby enabling concurrent improvements in activity and selectivity, is a desired goal in catalysis research. The use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) has emerged as a promising approach in heterogeneous catalysis, offering distinct and often outstanding performances across various chemical reactions. However, these SACs have faced challenges in finding broad application in high-temperature light alkane dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

In our study, we have successfully synthesized a Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) that breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during PDH. This catalyst demonstrates a significant improvement in propylene selectivity alongside a slight decrease in intrinsic dehydrogenation activity. Through detailed characterizations, we have confirmed the formation of Pt/Cu SAA and validated its effectiveness in transferring theoretical predictions to practical catalytic reactions. Specifically, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with a low Pt loading (0.1 wt%) exhibits a propylene selectivity of 90% and a high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520°C, WHSV = 4 h1, and C3H8/N2 = 1/1. Remarkably, this catalyst maintains excellent stability for at least 120 hours under these conditions, surpassing many previously reported low-temperature SAC applications.

In summary, the optimized pore structures of catalyst supports can significantly influence the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation reactions, especially when aiming to improve both activity and selectivity simultaneously. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst exemplifies how the strategic design of catalyst supports can lead to the development of highly effective and stable catalysts for PDH processes.

催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能方面发挥着关键作用。这些因素可以影响催化剂在长时间运行中保持其活性和选择性的能力。在PDH背景下，包括PtSn、PtZn、PtGa、PtIn、PtGe和PtCu在内的PtM合金通常由于存在缩放关系而难以实现活动性和选择性的同时提升。这种关系往往导致提高丙烯选择性的同时牺牲了脱氢内在活性。

开发能够打破这种缩放关系的催化剂，从而实现活性和选择性同时提升的目标是催化研究领域的理想目标。单原子催化剂（SACs）在异质催化领域已成为一个有前景的新前沿，它们在各种化学反应中展现出独特且经常卓越的性能。然而，这些SACs在高温下轻烃脱氢反应中，特别是PDH过程中，面临广泛的广泛应用挑战。

在我们的研究中，我们成功合成了能够打破PtM合金缩放关系的Pt/Cu单原子合金（SAA），该催化剂在PDH过程中实现了丙烯选择性显著提升以及内在脱氢活性轻微下降。通过详细的表征，我们证实了Pt/Cu SAA的形成，并验证了理论预测与实际催化反应之间的可转移性。具体而言，具有低Pt负载（0.1 wt%）的Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在大气压力、520°C、WHVS=4 h1、C3H8/N2=1/1条件下表现出90%的丙烯选择性以及10.6 mol g1Pt h1的高生成速率。值得注意的是，该催化剂在这些条件下至少稳定运行了120小时，超越了许多之前报道的低温SAC应用。

综上所述，催化剂支撑孔结构的优化可以显著影响丙烷脱氢反应的效率，尤其是在同时追求活性和选择性提升的情况下。Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表明，通过精心设计催化剂支撑，可以开发出高度有效和稳定的催化剂用于PDH过程。
