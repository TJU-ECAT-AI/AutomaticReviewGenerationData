[1] "In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520 C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream."
[2] "The CH activation starts at about 188 C on Pt nanoparticles, 204 C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 C on Cu nanoparticles, respectively."
[3] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[4] "The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07 h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3."
[5] "The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g1Pt h1 is presented (dash line)."
[6] "We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal."
