[1] "In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520 C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream."
[2] "The CH activation starts at about 188 C on Pt nanoparticles, 204 C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 C on Cu nanoparticles, respectively."
[3] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[4] "The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g1Pt h1 is presented (dash line)."
[5] "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/ IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke."
[6] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile."

The Pt/Cu single atom alloy catalyst achieves a high propylene selectivity of 90% with a high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under certain conditions. It also shows excellent stability for at least 120 hours. The CH activation temperature for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is lower than that for Pt nanoparticles and Cu nanoparticles. The propylene formation rate and selectivity are improved significantly when using the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst compared to the Pt-only catalyst. The thermodynamic conversion is indicated by a dash line. The Raman spectra show a decrease in the dehydrogenation degree of coke with increasing ID/IG ratio. The TPO profiles reveal the presence of two types of coke on each catalyst, with the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst exhibiting a lower dehydrogenation degree of coke.
