[1] "The pore size of the support material plays a critical role in coke formation, as it affects the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products."
[2] "Connectivity within the pore structure influences the diffusion of molecules, which can impact the rate of coke deposition and catalyst activity."
[3] "Uniformity in the pore structure ensures consistent interaction between the reactants and catalyst, leading to more stable and predictable performance."
[4] "Hierarchical pore arrangements allow for a balance between adsorption efficiency and mass transfer rates, optimizing both coke formation control and catalytic efficiency."
