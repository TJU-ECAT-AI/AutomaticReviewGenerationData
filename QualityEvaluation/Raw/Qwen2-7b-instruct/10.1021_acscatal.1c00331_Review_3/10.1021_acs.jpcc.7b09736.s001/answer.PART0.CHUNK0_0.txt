The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pore sizes and lower connectivity increase the likelihood of coke formation, while hierarchical pore structures can enhance catalyst performance by improving reactant and product accommodation. Uniformity in pore size leads to more consistent catalytic activity. These relationships imply that when designing optimal and effective catalysts, one should carefully consider the specific pore structure characteristics of the support material.

催化剂支撑孔结构的特性，包括孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层级排列，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能有显著影响。较大的孔径和较低的连通性增加了焦炭形成的可能性，而层级孔结构可以通过改善反应物和产物的容纳来提高催化剂性能。均匀的孔径大小导致更一致的催化活性。这些关系意味着，在设计最佳和有效的催化剂时，应仔细考虑支撑材料的具体孔结构特性。
