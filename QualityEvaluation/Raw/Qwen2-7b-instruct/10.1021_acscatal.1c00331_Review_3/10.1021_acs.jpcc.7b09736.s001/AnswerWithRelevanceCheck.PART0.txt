          [1] "Catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are sensitive to the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of catalyst support."
          [3] "Coke formation is more likely in catalyst supports with larger pore sizes and lower connectivity."
          [4] "Hierarchical pore structures can enhance catalyst performance by providing better accommodation for reactants and products."
          [5] "Uniformity in pore size contributes to more consistent catalytic activity across the support surface."
          [6] "The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include considering the specific pore structure characteristics of the support material."
