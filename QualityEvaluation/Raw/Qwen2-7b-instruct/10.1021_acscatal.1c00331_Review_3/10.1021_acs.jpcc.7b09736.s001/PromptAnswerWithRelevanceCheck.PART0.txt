<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pore sizes and lower connectivity increase the likelihood of coke formation, while hierarchical pore structures can enhance catalyst performance by improving reactant and product accommodation. Uniformity in pore size leads to more consistent catalytic activity. These relationships imply that when designing optimal and effective catalysts, one should carefully consider the specific pore structure characteristics of the support material.
