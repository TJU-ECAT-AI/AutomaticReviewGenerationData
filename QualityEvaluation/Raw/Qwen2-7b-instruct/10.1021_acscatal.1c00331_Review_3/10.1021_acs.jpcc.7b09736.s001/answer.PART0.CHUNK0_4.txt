Catalyst support pore structures, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play crucial roles in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Larger pore sizes enable better coke accommodation due to increased surface area, reducing coke buildup. High connectivity facilitates more efficient mass transfer, which helps in mitigating coke formation by promoting the rapid removal of reaction intermediates. Uniform pore size distribution ensures a consistent reaction environment, improving catalyst activity and selectivity. Hierarchical pore structures, combining macropores and mesopores, offer an optimized balance for enhancing both catalytic activity and reducing coke deposition. These findings imply that selecting materials with appropriate pore architecture is essential for designing optimal and effective catalysts.
