[1] "Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2. The reaction rates decrease in the order of O2 > H2O > H2."
[2] "Typically, coke is oxidized by air in industrial processes such as catalytic cracking, hydrotreating processes, and catalytic reforming."
[3] "The mobility of activated oxygen species on the surface of Al2O3 was much higher than that of SiO2."
[4] "The lower the temperature of the oxygen exchange, the greater the surface mobility of the oxides."
[5] "On 3% Pt-Al2O3, coke was located primarily on both the metal-support boundary and the support, while coke was located mainly on the support in the case of 3% Pt-SBA-15."
[6] "The oxidation of coke located near metallic sites was catalyzed, resulting in an oxidation peak at a lower temperature."
[7] "However, the oxidation of coke located far from metallic sites was controlled by oxygen mobility which results from the nature of the supports."

The pore structures of catalyst supports, specifically pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Smaller pore sizes tend to reduce coke formation and accumulation due to decreased space for coke particles. The connectivity and uniformity of pores affect how easily coke can move through the catalyst, impacting its distribution and reactivity. Hierarchical pore structures, featuring both macropores and mesopores, allow for better dispersion of coke, reducing its impact on catalyst efficiency. The proximity of coke to metal sites on the catalyst surface determines whether the oxidation process is catalyzed or controlled by oxygen mobility on the support material. Catalysts with a metal-support boundary or a support-rich area where coke forms closer to the metal show lower oxidation temperatures due to enhanced catalytic activity. Conversely, coke located far from metal sites is more susceptible to oxygen mobility, affecting its oxidation temperature based on the support's oxygen exchange properties. The results suggest that designing catalysts with optimized pore structures and metal-support interactions can lead to improved PDH performance and effective coke management.

催化剂支持的孔结构，特别是孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭的形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。较小的孔径倾向于减少焦炭的形成和积累，因为减少了焦炭颗粒的空间。孔结构的连通性和均匀性影响焦炭在催化剂中的移动性，从而影响其分布和活性。具有宏孔和介孔的层级孔结构允许更好的焦炭分散，从而降低其对催化剂效率的影响。焦炭靠近催化剂表面金属点的位置决定了氧化过程是否由支持材料上的活性氧的催化作用或氧的流动性控制。靠近金属的焦炭区域表现出较低的氧化温度，因为增强的催化活性。相反，远离金属的焦炭更容易受到支持材料上氧交换性质的影响，其氧化温度取决于氧的流动性。结果表明，设计具有优化孔结构和金属-支持相互作用的催化剂可以提高PDH性能并有效管理焦炭。
