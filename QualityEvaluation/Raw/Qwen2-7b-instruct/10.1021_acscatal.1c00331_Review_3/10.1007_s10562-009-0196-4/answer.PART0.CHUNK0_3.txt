[1] "Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2."
[2] "The oxidation of coke located near metallic sites was catalyzed, resulting in an oxidation peak at a lower temperature. However, the oxidation of coke located far from metallic sites was controlled by oxygen mobility which results from the nature of the supports."
[3] "The mobility of activated oxygen species on the surface of Al2O3 was much higher than that of SiO2."
[4] "The lower the temperature of the oxygen exchange, the greater the surface mobility of the oxides."
[5] "On 3% Pt-Al2O3, coke was located primarily on both the metal-support boundary and the support, while coke was located mainly on the support in the case of 3% Pt-SBA-15."

The pore structures of catalyst supports, specifically their size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Smaller pore sizes lead to increased coke yield due to reduced space for reactant diffusion, potentially affecting catalyst efficiency negatively. The location of coke on the catalyst surface also plays a crucial role in its oxidation behavior. Coke closer to metallic sites experiences catalyzed oxidation at lower temperatures due to direct contact or the spillover effect, whereas coke farther away is controlled by the mobility of oxygen on the support's surface, influenced by the type of oxide. Oxygen's surface mobility on materials like Al2O3 is notably higher than on others, impacting the oxidation temperature of coke. The design of optimal catalysts for PDH involves considering these factors to ensure efficient coke management and maintain catalyst activity.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性，特别是其大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭的形成、容纳及其整体催化剂性能产生了重大影响。较小的孔径导致焦炭产量增加，可能对催化剂效率产生负面影响。焦炭在催化剂表面的位置也对其氧化行为起着关键作用。靠近金属点的焦炭在较低温度下经历催化氧化，由于直接接触或溢流效应，而远离金属点的焦炭则由支撑表面上氧的移动性控制，该移动性受到材料如Al2O3等氧化物类型的影响。Al2O3上的氧的表面活性远高于其他材料，影响焦炭的氧化温度。设计高效的PDH催化剂时，考虑这些因素以确保有效的焦炭管理并维持催化剂活性至关重要。
