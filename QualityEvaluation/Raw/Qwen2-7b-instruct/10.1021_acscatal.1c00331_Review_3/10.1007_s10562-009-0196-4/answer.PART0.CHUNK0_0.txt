[1] "In this study, different oxidation patterns of coke over 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts were observed but the same catalytic performance was obtained in the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2. The reaction rates decrease in the order of O2 > H2O > H2."
[3] "The structure of the coke formed over the catalysts was the same."
[4] "The oxidation temperatures of the first and second peaks in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-Al2O3 were 465 and 513 C (at the shoulder), respectively, whereas the oxidation temperature in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-SBA-15 was 556 C."
[5] "From the XRD patterns and TPO profiles of the liberated cokes, we suggest that the cokes on both catalysts have the similar structure and are composed of very weakly crystallized turbostratic carbon."
[6] "The oxidation temperature of coke before removing the supports should be equal to or lower than that of the liberated coke if the contact between Pt and coke was intimate."
[7] "On 3% Pt-Al2O3, coke was located primarily on both the metal-support boundary and the support, while coke was located mainly on the support in the case of 3% Pt-SBA-15."
[8] "The oxidation of coke located near metallic sites was catalyzed, resulting in an oxidation peak at a lower temperature."
[9] "However, the oxidation of coke located far from metallic sites was controlled by oxygen mobility which results from the nature of the supports."
[10] "The mobility of activated oxygen species on the surface of Al2O3 was much higher than that of SiO2."

1. Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These characteristics affect the location of coke on the catalyst surface, which in turn influences the catalytic activity and the oxidation temperature of coke. In this study, the 3% Pt-Al2O3 catalyst showed different oxidation patterns of coke compared to the 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalyst, despite exhibiting similar catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The differences in the oxidation patterns are attributed to the unique pore structures and oxygen mobility on the surface of the supports.

2. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in PDH reactions are significant. By understanding how pore structure influences coke formation and oxidation, researchers can tailor catalyst design to minimize coke accumulation and maintain high catalytic activity. For instance, optimizing the pore size and structure of the support can control the location of coke, potentially reducing the oxidation temperature required for coke removal. This can lead to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes.

3. In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Moreover, hierarchical arrangements of pores could offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, improving the overall catalytic performance.

4. To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This can involve developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Additionally, incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

1. 催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。这些特性影响焦炭在催化剂表面的位置，进而影响催化活性和焦炭氧化温度。在此研究中，3% Pt-Al2O3催化剂与3% Pt-SBA-15催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的氧化模式不同，尽管其表现出相似的催化性能。焦炭氧化模式的不同归因于支持材料的特殊孔结构和表面氧移动性。

2. 这些关系对于设计PDH反应中的最佳和有效催化剂具有重要意义。通过了解孔结构如何影响焦炭形成和氧化，研究人员可以调整催化剂设计以减少焦炭积累并保持高催化活性。例如，通过优化支持材料的孔径和结构来控制焦炭位置，可能降低焦炭去除所需的氧化温度。这可以导致提高催化剂稳定性和效率，以及降低再生过程的能量消耗。

3. 在设计PDH反应的催化剂时，考虑孔径、连通性和均匀性的平衡至关重要。较小的孔径可能会限制氧物种的扩散，影响溢流效应，并因此降低焦炭的氧化温度。较大的孔径可以增强氧扩散，可能使溢流效应更有效，降低焦炭的氧化温度。此外，孔结构的层级排列可以提供多个氧扩散路径，提高催化剂的整体催化性能。

4. 要实现最佳催化剂性能，研究人员应努力创建允许高效氧扩散同时减少焦炭形成和积累的支持材料。这可能涉及开发具有特定孔结构的材料，如多孔支持，以促进溢流效应而不损害催化剂的完整性。此外，可以通过引入孔结构的周期性或各向异性来进一步优化氧物种的扩散路径，从而增强催化剂的催化活性和稳定性。
