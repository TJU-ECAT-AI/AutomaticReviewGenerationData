<p>In this study, different oxidation patterns of coke over 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts were observed but the same catalytic performance was obtained in the dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>The oxidation peaks of coke on 3% Pt-Al2O3 appeared at 416 and 513 C, while only one sharp peak was present at 556 C in the coke oxidation pattern of 3% Pt-SBA-15.</p>
<p>Using the XRD patterns, it was confirmed that the structure of the coke formed over the catalysts was the same.</p>
<p>The TPO profiles indicated that the relative distance of coke from the metallic phase (coke location) and the oxygen mobility on each support played important roles in the oxidation of coke.</p>
<p>On 3% Pt-Al2O3, coke was located primarily on both the metal-support boundary and the support, while coke was located mainly on the support in the case of 3% Pt-SBA-15.</p>
<p>The oxidation of coke located near metallic sites was catalyzed, resulting in an oxidation peak at a lower temperature.</p>
<p>However, the oxidation of coke located far from metallic sites was controlled by oxygen mobility which results from the nature of the supports.</p>
<p>The mobility of activated oxygen species on the surface of Al2O3 was much higher than that of SiO2.</p>

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. In this study, coke formation over 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts showed different oxidation patterns, despite having the same catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The coke oxidation peaks varied depending on the catalyst type, with 3% Pt-Al2O3 exhibiting peaks at 416 and 513°C, while 3% Pt-SBA-15 showed a single peak at 556°C. XRD analysis confirmed that the coke structures were similar across both catalyst types. The TPO profiles revealed that the coke location relative to the metallic phase and the oxygen mobility on the support surface played significant roles in coke oxidation. The coke location and the support's oxygen mobility influenced the catalytic performance and stability of the catalysts. Notably, the mobility of activated oxygen species on Al2O3 was higher compared to SiO2, which contributed to the lower oxidation temperature of coke on Al2O3 compared to SiO2. These findings are crucial for designing catalysts for PDH reactions, particularly regarding catalyst regeneration, as they highlight the importance of controlling the oxygen mobility and coke location to maintain stable and efficient catalyst performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，催化剂支持孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，影响焦炭的形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。在本研究中，3% Pt-Al2O3和3% Pt-SBA-15催化剂上焦炭的氧化模式不同，尽管这两种催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的催化性能相同。焦炭氧化峰根据催化剂类型而变化，3% Pt-Al2O3的焦炭氧化峰出现在416°C和513°C，而3% Pt-SBA-15的单个尖峰出现在556°C。X射线衍射分析证实了两种催化剂上形成的焦炭结构相同。TPO谱表明，焦炭相对于金属相的位置和支撑表面的氧流动性在焦炭氧化过程中起着重要作用。焦炭位置和支撑的氧流动性影响了催化剂的性能和稳定性。值得注意的是，Al2O3上的激活氧物种的流动性高于SiO2，这导致了Al2O3上的焦炭氧化温度低于SiO2。这些发现对于设计PDH反应中的催化剂至关重要，特别是对于催化剂再生，因为它们强调了控制氧流动性和焦炭位置以维持稳定和高效催化剂性能的重要性。
