1. Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These characteristics affect the location of coke on the catalyst surface, which in turn influences the catalytic activity and the oxidation temperature of coke. In this study, the 3% Pt-Al2O3 catalyst showed different oxidation patterns of coke compared to the 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalyst, despite exhibiting similar catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The differences in the oxidation patterns are attributed to the unique pore structures and oxygen mobility on the surface of the supports.

2. The implications of these relationships for designing optimal and effective catalysts in PDH reactions are significant. By understanding how pore structure influences coke formation and oxidation, researchers can tailor catalyst design to minimize coke accumulation and maintain high catalytic activity. For instance, optimizing the pore size and structure of the support can control the location of coke, potentially reducing the oxidation temperature required for coke removal. This can lead to improved catalyst stability and efficiency, as well as lower energy consumption for regeneration processes.

3. In designing catalysts for PDH reactions, it is crucial to consider the balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Smaller pore sizes might limit the diffusion of oxygen species, affecting the spillover effect and thus the oxidation temperature of coke. Larger pore sizes can enhance oxygen diffusion, potentially leading to a more effective spillover effect and lower oxidation temperatures. Moreover, hierarchical arrangements of pores could offer multiple pathways for oxygen diffusion, improving the overall catalytic performance.

4. To achieve optimal catalyst performance, researchers should aim to create a support that allows for efficient oxygen diffusion while minimizing coke formation and accumulation. This can involve developing materials with specific pore structures, such as mesoporous supports, that facilitate the spillover effect without compromising the integrity of the catalyst. Additionally, incorporating features like periodicity or anisotropy in the pore structure can further optimize the diffusion paths for oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

1. 催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。这些特性影响焦炭在催化剂表面的位置，进而影响催化活性和焦炭氧化温度。在此研究中，3% Pt-Al2O3催化剂与3% Pt-SBA-15催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的氧化模式不同，尽管其表现出相似的催化性能。焦炭氧化模式的不同归因于支持材料的特殊孔结构和表面氧移动性。

2. 这些关系对于设计PDH反应中的最佳和有效催化剂具有重要意义。通过了解孔结构如何影响焦炭形成和氧化，研究人员可以调整催化剂设计以减少焦炭积累并保持高催化活性。例如，通过优化支持材料的孔径和结构来控制焦炭位置，可能降低焦炭去除所需的氧化温度。这可以导致提高催化剂稳定性和效率，以及降低再生过程的能量消耗。

3. 在设计PDH反应的催化剂时，考虑孔径、连通性和均匀性的平衡至关重要。较小的孔径可能会限制氧物种的扩散，影响溢流效应，并因此降低焦炭的氧化温度。较大的孔径可以增强氧扩散，可能使溢流效应更有效，降低焦炭的氧化温度。此外，孔结构的层级排列可以提供多个氧扩散路径，提高催化剂的整体催化性能。

4. 要实现最佳催化剂性能，研究人员应努力创建允许高效氧扩散同时减少焦炭形成和积累的支持材料。这可能涉及开发具有特定孔结构的材料，如多孔支持，以促进溢流效应而不损害催化剂的完整性。此外，可以通过引入孔结构的周期性或各向异性来进一步优化氧物种的扩散路径，从而增强催化剂的催化活性和稳定性。

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically:

1. **Pore Size**: Smaller pore sizes can lead to higher coke yields due to restricted diffusion, while larger pore sizes might allow easier coke formation and accumulation. This is evident from the different coke yields observed on 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0%), 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6%), 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7%), and 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5%).

2. **Connectivity and Uniformity**: The way pores are connected and their uniformity can affect how easily coke can move through the catalyst bed and deposit on the surface. More interconnected and uniform pore structures can lead to more efficient coke management.

3. **Hierarchical Arrangements**: The presence of different size ranges within the pore structure can impact coke deposition and removal. Hierarchical structures may offer better accommodation for coke particles, influencing their stability and ease of oxidation.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts involve creating pore structures that minimize coke formation while maximizing its efficient removal. This can be achieved by optimizing pore size distribution, enhancing pore connectivity and uniformity, and possibly incorporating hierarchical structures. These designs aim to ensure that coke does not form intimate contacts with the catalyst surface, reducing the likelihood of sintering and maintaining high catalyst activity and stability during PDH reactions.

催化剂支持孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。具体来说：

1. **孔径**：较小的孔径可能导致更高的焦炭生成量，由于限制扩散，而较大的孔径可能允许更容易的焦炭形成和积累。从3% Pt-Al2O3（19.0%）、3% Pt-Al2O3-1（9.6%）、3% Pt-SBA-15（9.7%）和3% Pt-SiO2（5.5%）上观察到的不同焦炭产量可以看出这一点。

2. **连通性和均匀性**：孔之间的连接方式及其均匀性可以影响焦炭在催化剂床中的移动和沉积效率。更连通和均匀的孔结构可能为更有效地管理焦炭提供更好的条件。

3. **层次结构**：孔结构中不同尺寸范围的存在可以影响焦炭的沉积和去除。层次结构可能为焦炭颗粒提供更好的容纳空间，从而影响其稳定性并易于氧化。

设计最佳和有效的催化剂时，需要通过优化孔径分布、增强孔连通性和均匀性以及可能引入层次结构来减少焦炭形成的同时最大化其有效去除。这些设计旨在确保焦炭不与催化剂表面形成紧密接触，降低结块的可能性并保持高催化剂活性和稳定性期间的PDH反应。

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. In this study, coke formation over 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts showed different oxidation patterns, despite having the same catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The coke oxidation peaks varied depending on the catalyst type, with 3% Pt-Al2O3 exhibiting peaks at 416 and 513°C, while 3% Pt-SBA-15 showed a single peak at 556°C. XRD analysis confirmed that the coke structures were similar across both catalyst types. The TPO profiles revealed that the coke location relative to the metallic phase and the oxygen mobility on the support surface played significant roles in coke oxidation. The coke location and the support's oxygen mobility influenced the catalytic performance and stability of the catalysts. Notably, the mobility of activated oxygen species on Al2O3 was higher compared to SiO2, which contributed to the lower oxidation temperature of coke on Al2O3 compared to SiO2. These findings are crucial for designing catalysts for PDH reactions, particularly regarding catalyst regeneration, as they highlight the importance of controlling the oxygen mobility and coke location to maintain stable and efficient catalyst performance.

The pore structures of catalyst supports, specifically their size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly impact coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Smaller pore sizes lead to increased coke yield due to reduced space for reactant diffusion, potentially affecting catalyst efficiency negatively. The location of coke on the catalyst surface also plays a crucial role in its oxidation behavior. Coke closer to metallic sites experiences catalyzed oxidation at lower temperatures due to direct contact or the spillover effect, whereas coke farther away is controlled by the mobility of oxygen on the support's surface, influenced by the type of oxide. Oxygen's surface mobility on materials like Al2O3 is notably higher than on others, impacting the oxidation temperature of coke. The design of optimal catalysts for PDH involves considering these factors to ensure efficient coke management and maintain catalyst activity.

催化剂支持的孔结构特性，特别是其大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭的形成、容纳及其整体催化剂性能产生了重大影响。较小的孔径导致焦炭产量增加，可能对催化剂效率产生负面影响。焦炭在催化剂表面的位置也对其氧化行为起着关键作用。靠近金属点的焦炭在较低温度下经历催化氧化，由于直接接触或溢流效应，而远离金属点的焦炭则由支撑表面上氧的移动性控制，该移动性受到材料如Al2O3等氧化物类型的影响。Al2O3上的氧的表面活性远高于其他材料，影响焦炭的氧化温度。设计高效的PDH催化剂时，考虑这些因素以确保有效的焦炭管理并维持催化剂活性至关重要。

The pore structures of catalyst supports, specifically pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Smaller pore sizes tend to reduce coke formation and accumulation due to decreased space for coke particles. The connectivity and uniformity of pores affect how easily coke can move through the catalyst, impacting its distribution and reactivity. Hierarchical pore structures, featuring both macropores and mesopores, allow for better dispersion of coke, reducing its impact on catalyst efficiency. The proximity of coke to metal sites on the catalyst surface determines whether the oxidation process is catalyzed or controlled by oxygen mobility on the support material. Catalysts with a metal-support boundary or a support-rich area where coke forms closer to the metal show lower oxidation temperatures due to enhanced catalytic activity. Conversely, coke located far from metal sites is more susceptible to oxygen mobility, affecting its oxidation temperature based on the support's oxygen exchange properties. The results suggest that designing catalysts with optimized pore structures and metal-support interactions can lead to improved PDH performance and effective coke management.

催化剂支持的孔结构，特别是孔径大小、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭的形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。较小的孔径倾向于减少焦炭的形成和积累，因为减少了焦炭颗粒的空间。孔结构的连通性和均匀性影响焦炭在催化剂中的移动性，从而影响其分布和活性。具有宏孔和介孔的层级孔结构允许更好的焦炭分散，从而降低其对催化剂效率的影响。焦炭靠近催化剂表面金属点的位置决定了氧化过程是否由支持材料上的活性氧的催化作用或氧的流动性控制。靠近金属的焦炭区域表现出较低的氧化温度，因为增强的催化活性。相反，远离金属的焦炭更容易受到支持材料上氧交换性质的影响，其氧化温度取决于氧的流动性。结果表明，设计具有优化孔结构和金属-支持相互作用的催化剂可以提高PDH性能并有效管理焦炭。
