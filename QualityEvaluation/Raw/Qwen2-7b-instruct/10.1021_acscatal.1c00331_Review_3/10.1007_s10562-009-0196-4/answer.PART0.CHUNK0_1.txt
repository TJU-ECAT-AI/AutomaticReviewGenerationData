[1] "Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2."
[2] "In this study, different oxidation patterns of coke over 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts were observed but the same catalytic performance was obtained in the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "However, the oxidation peaks of coke on 3% Pt-Al2O3 appeared at 416 and 513 C, while only one sharp peak was present at 556 C in the coke oxidation pattern of 3% Pt-SBA-15."
[4] "This is due to the fact that the acidity and propane hydrogenolysis on Pt-Al2O3 is higher than that on Pt-SBA-15."
[5] "The oxidation temperatures of the first and second peaks in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-Al2O3 were 465 and 513 C (at the shoulder), respectively, whereas the oxidation temperature in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-SBA-15 was 556 C."
[6] "This means that coke did not form an intimate contact with Pt during deposition."
[7] "It was found that the mobility of activated oxygen species (at 400 C) on the surface of Al2O3 was approximately 60 times higher than that on SiO2."
[8] "The oxidation temperature of coke before removing the supports should be equal to or lower than that of the liberated coke if the contact between Pt and coke was intimate."

Various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures, such as pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically:

1. **Pore Size**: Smaller pore sizes can lead to higher coke yields due to restricted diffusion, while larger pore sizes might allow easier coke formation and accumulation. This is evident from the different coke yields observed on 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0%), 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6%), 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7%), and 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5%).

2. **Connectivity and Uniformity**: The way pores are connected and their uniformity can affect how easily coke can move through the catalyst bed and deposit on the surface. More interconnected and uniform pore structures can lead to more efficient coke management.

3. **Hierarchical Arrangements**: The presence of different size ranges within the pore structure can impact coke deposition and removal. Hierarchical structures may offer better accommodation for coke particles, influencing their stability and ease of oxidation.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts involve creating pore structures that minimize coke formation while maximizing its efficient removal. This can be achieved by optimizing pore size distribution, enhancing pore connectivity and uniformity, and possibly incorporating hierarchical structures. These designs aim to ensure that coke does not form intimate contacts with the catalyst surface, reducing the likelihood of sintering and maintaining high catalyst activity and stability during PDH reactions.

催化剂支持孔结构的各种特性，如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。具体来说：

1. **孔径**：较小的孔径可能导致更高的焦炭生成量，由于限制扩散，而较大的孔径可能允许更容易的焦炭形成和积累。从3% Pt-Al2O3（19.0%）、3% Pt-Al2O3-1（9.6%）、3% Pt-SBA-15（9.7%）和3% Pt-SiO2（5.5%）上观察到的不同焦炭产量可以看出这一点。

2. **连通性和均匀性**：孔之间的连接方式及其均匀性可以影响焦炭在催化剂床中的移动和沉积效率。更连通和均匀的孔结构可能为更有效地管理焦炭提供更好的条件。

3. **层次结构**：孔结构中不同尺寸范围的存在可以影响焦炭的沉积和去除。层次结构可能为焦炭颗粒提供更好的容纳空间，从而影响其稳定性并易于氧化。

设计最佳和有效的催化剂时，需要通过优化孔径分布、增强孔连通性和均匀性以及可能引入层次结构来减少焦炭形成的同时最大化其有效去除。这些设计旨在确保焦炭不与催化剂表面形成紧密接触，降低结块的可能性并保持高催化剂活性和稳定性期间的PDH反应。
