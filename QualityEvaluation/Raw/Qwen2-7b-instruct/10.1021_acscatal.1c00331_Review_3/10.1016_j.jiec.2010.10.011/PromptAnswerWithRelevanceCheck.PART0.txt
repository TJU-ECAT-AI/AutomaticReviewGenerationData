[1] "Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[2] "In the TPO results, along with Sn contents, oxidation peak of coke was shifted to a higher temperature, which can be interpreted that coke formed during the reaction was mainly located on the support in the case of PtSn/ alumina because coke generated on metal surfaces was readily transferred to the support in the presence of Sn."
[3] "Our observation is very similar to the data reported by Liwu et al. that investigated dynamic process of carbon deposition on Pt and PtSn supported alumina catalysts used for dehydrogenation of n-butane with H2 adding in the feedstock."
[4] "XRD and XPS analyses reveal that coke from all spent catalysts had the same pregraphite-like carbon structure and was not affected by Sn addition."

1. The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Proper pore structure can facilitate the efficient transport of reactants and products, minimize the risk of coke formation, and enhance the catalyst's stability and activity. The design of optimal and effective catalysts often involves tailoring the pore structure to match the specific requirements of the PDH process.

2. The addition of tin (Sn) to the catalyst system shifts the coke oxidation peak temperature to a higher temperature in the thermogravimetric analysis of spent catalysts. This suggests that the majority of coke formed during the PDH reaction is located on the support rather than on the metal phase. The electronic effect of tin on the platinum (Pt) surface weakens the interaction between adsorbed hydrocarbon species and the Pt surface, leading to the transfer of coke from the metal to the support. This phenomenon implies that the fraction of coke on the Pt metallic phase is significantly reduced after the addition of tin, which contributes to enhanced catalytic stability.

3. The coke structure on spent catalysts is found to be consistent across different catalyst systems, characterized by a pregraphite-like carbon structure. This finding indicates that the coke formation mechanism is largely independent of the specific metal-support combination, with the pregraphite-like carbon structure being a common feature. The absence of significant influence from the addition of tin on the coke structure suggests that the modification of the coke structure itself is not a primary factor affecting the coke tolerance of the catalysts.

4. The dynamic process of carbon deposition on Pt and PtSn supported alumina catalysts, as investigated by Liwu et al., demonstrates similarities to the observed behavior in propane dehydrogenation. The data from these studies highlight the importance of understanding the kinetics of coke formation and the factors influencing its location on the catalyst surface. This knowledge can inform the development of strategies to optimize catalyst design, reduce coke formation, and enhance the overall efficiency and longevity of PDH processes.

1. 催化剂支撑的孔结构特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和催化剂整体性能产生重要影响。合理的孔结构有助于有效促进反应物和产物的传输，减少焦炭形成的风险，并增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。设计最优且有效的催化剂通常涉及根据PDH过程的具体需求调整孔结构。

2. 锡（Sn）的添加使在热重分析中测试的废弃催化剂上的焦炭氧化峰温度升高。这表明PDH反应中形成的大部分焦炭位于支撑材料上而非金属相。锡在铂（Pt）表面的电子效应减弱了吸附烃物种与Pt表面之间的相互作用，导致焦炭从金属转移到支撑材料。这一现象表明，添加锡后Pt金属相中的焦炭含量显著降低，从而有助于提高催化剂稳定性。

3. 在废弃催化剂上的焦炭结构被发现是一致的，特征为预石墨碳结构。这一发现表明焦炭形成机制在不同催化剂系统之间相对独立，预石墨碳结构是常见特征。焦炭结构不受锡添加显著影响的发现表明，修改焦炭结构本身不是影响催化剂焦炭耐受性的主要因素。

4. 李武等人的研究揭示了Pt和PtSn支持氧化铝催化剂上碳沉积的动态过程与PDH过程中观察到的行为有相似之处。这些数据强调了理解焦炭形成动力学以及影响其在催化剂表面位置的因素的重要性。这些知识可以指导优化催化剂设计策略、减少焦炭形成并提高PDH过程的整体效率。

2.2. Catalyst characterization
Coke on spent catalysts was measured by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments Q50). Approximately 10.0 mg of spent catalyst was charged into the sample pan, and then was heated to 700 8C at a rate of 40 8C/min in a flow of air. The coke content, based on a dried sample of each catalyst, was calculated after subtracting the water content.
2.3. Catalytic deactivation test
Dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a quartz fixed-bed reactor flow system at atmospheric pressure. For all experiments,the catalyst (100 mg) was previously reduced with a flow (50 ml/ min) of pure H2 at 600 8C for 2 h and purged to remove H2 gas remaining in the reactor for 10 min with a flow (100 ml/min) of N2.
Then the reaction mixture consisting of N2 (100 ml/min) and C3H8 (30 ml/min) was fed into the reactor at 600 8C. The flow rate of each gas was controlled by a mass-flow-controller that had been previously calibrated. Beginning 1 min from the start of the reaction, the product of the reaction was sampled at time intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC).

The coke content was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a TA Instruments Q50 apparatus. The coke was heated at a rate of 40°C/min in a flow of air until reaching 700°C. The coke content was calculated based on the weight loss of the dried catalyst sample after subtracting the water content. Propane dehydrogenation experiments were conducted in a quartz fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was reduced with a hydrogen flow at 600°C for 2 hours and then flushed with nitrogen to remove residual hydrogen. The reaction mixture containing nitrogen and propane was introduced into the reactor at 600°C. The gas flow rates were controlled using a mass-flow controller. Samples of the reaction product were collected at regular intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography.

3.2. Coke structure
Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of fresh and spent catalysts of 1% Pt and 1% Pt1.67% Sn. Four patterns from (a) to (d) display three distinct peaks at 2u = 38, 46, and 678, which agree with the standard for g-Al2O3 (JCPDS No. 29-1486). These peaks have obviously strong intensities indicating that g-Al2O3 has a good crystallinity. The platinum, tin, and intermetallic phases are not detected in the fresh and spent catalysts. This indicates either that Pt, Sn, and intermetallic species are well dispersed on the g-Al2O3 after reduction and are not sintered after reaction or that the small crystallite size is below the limit of XRD detection. The similarity of the gamma phase of Al2O3 in the XRD patterns between fresh and spent catalysts indicates that the structure of the alumina support did not change after the reaction.

Figure 3 illustrates the XRD patterns of fresh and spent catalysts containing 1% Pt and 1% Pt1.67% Sn. Patterns (a) through (d) exhibit three distinct peaks at 2u = 38°, 46°, and 67.8°, matching the standard for gamma-alumina (JCPDS No. 29-1486). These peaks have high intensity, indicating that gamma-alumina has good crystallinity. Neither platinum, tin, nor intermetallic phases were detected in the fresh and spent catalysts. This suggests that platinum, tin, and intermetallic species are well dispersed on gamma-alumina after reduction and do not fuse post-reaction, or that the small crystal size falls below XRD detection limits. The similarity of the gamma phase of alumina in the XRD patterns of both fresh and spent catalysts indicates that the alumina support's structure remained unchanged after the reaction.

3.3. Coke location
The TGA technique allows a determination of the coke location on supported metal catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 6.
Two successive peaks are observed in the TGA profile of 1% Pt-spent catalysts after deactivation for 160 min on stream. The TGA profile was fitted using Gaussian curves to determine the temperature of the first and second oxidation peaks (at the shoulder). At least two peaks are observed in the TPO profile of the four spent catalysts and the portion of the peaks is dependent on Sn contents; the oxidation temperatures of the main peaks are shifted from 465 to 513 8C.

The pore structures of catalyst supports, particularly their size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pores act as pathways for reactants and products, influencing the reaction kinetics and selectivity. Larger and more interconnected pores facilitate easier access for reactants and products, reducing the risk of clogging and maintaining high catalyst activity. Uniformity ensures consistent performance across the catalyst bed, while hierarchical pore structures offer a balance between diffusion efficiency and resistance, optimizing the PDH process.

The presence of tin in the catalyst modifies the electronic properties of platinum, facilitating the transfer of coke from the metal phase to the support. This reduces the fraction of coke on the metal surface, thereby inhibiting low coordination sites where coke precursors are typically formed. By decreasing the amount of coke on the metal surface, the risk of encapsulating and poisoning active sites is minimized, leading to enhanced catalyst stability and performance.

The design of optimal and effective catalysts thus requires careful consideration of pore structure characteristics. Supports with appropriate pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements can effectively accommodate coke, reduce clogging, and maintain high activity throughout the PDH process. The addition of tin to the catalyst formulation further optimizes this by promoting coke transfer to the support, thereby enhancing catalyst tolerance to deactivation and improving overall performance.

催化剂支撑孔结构，特别是其大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能起着关键作用。孔隙充当反应物和产物的通道，影响反应动力学和选择性。较大的孔径和更紧密的连通性有助于简化反应物和产物的访问，降低堵塞风险并保持高催化剂活性。均匀性确保了床层中的一致性能，而层次孔结构提供了一种在扩散效率与阻力之间取得平衡的方式，优化PDH过程。

锡的存在改变了铂的电子性质，促进了焦炭从金属相转移到支撑相。这减少了金属表面的焦炭量，从而抑制了形成焦炭前体的低配位点。通过减少金属表面的焦炭量，降低了覆盖和毒化活性位点的风险，从而提高了催化剂稳定性并改善了整体性能。

因此，在设计最优和有效的催化剂时，需要仔细考虑孔结构特征。具有适当孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构的支持可以有效容纳焦炭，减少堵塞，并在整个PDH过程中保持高活性。添加锡到催化剂配方进一步优化了这一点，通过促进焦炭转移到支撑，从而增强了催化剂对失活的耐受性和改善了总体性能。

[2] "Although Sn is one of the most efficient promoters, deactivation due to coke formation is not completely eliminated, and the catalysts still have a short lifetime and require regeneration to restore activity."

The pore structures of the catalyst support play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. Specifically, the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support affect the efficiency of coke deposition, its spatial distribution within the catalyst bed, and its impact on the catalytic activity. 

Pore size and connectivity enable the diffusion of reactants and products, facilitating the reaction kinetics. Uniformity ensures a consistent distribution of the active sites across the catalyst surface, promoting uniform conversion. Hierarchical arrangements of pores can optimize the balance between diffusion pathways and surface area, enhancing both the reactivity and resistance to coke formation.

In the context of PDH, tin (Sn) as a promoter modifies the electronic properties of platinum (Pt), leading to enhanced coke tolerance and comparable catalytic performance to monometallic catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicate that the coke structure across all spent catalysts is pregraphite-like carbon, with a specific binding energy of 283.9 eV in XPS spectra. 

The presence of tin shifts the coke oxidation temperature to higher values, suggesting that the fraction of coke on the Pt metallic phase is significantly reduced. This shift facilitates the transfer of coke from the metal phase to the support, decreasing the coke content on the metal surface. The Pt1.67%Sn catalyst exhibits the lowest coke content due to the inhibitory effect of tin on the low coordination sites on the Pt surface, thereby preserving a higher proportion of active sites and maintaining catalytic activity during the PDH reaction.

These findings highlight the importance of tailoring the pore structure and incorporating appropriate promoters to enhance the stability and efficiency of catalysts in PDH processes, ultimately leading to improved product yield and reduced maintenance requirements.

催化剂支撑的孔结构在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中起着关键作用，影响焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。特别是，支撑的孔大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响焦炭沉积的效率、其在催化剂床内的空间分布及其对催化活性的影响。

孔径和连通性允许反应物和产物的扩散，促进反应动力学。均匀性确保催化剂表面活性位点的分布一致，促进均匀转化。层次结构的孔可以优化扩散路径与表面积之间的平衡，增强反应性和抗焦炭形成能力。

在PDH的背景下，锡（Sn）作为促进剂修改了铂（Pt）的电子性质，导致增强的焦炭容忍度和与单金属催化剂相当的催化性能。X射线衍射（XRD）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析表明，所有烧焦催化剂中的焦炭结构均为预石墨碳，XPS光谱中的结合能为283.9 eV。

锡的存在使焦炭氧化温度升高，表明Pt金属相中的焦炭比例显著降低。这促进了焦炭从金属相转移到支撑物，减少了金属表面上的焦炭含量。1% Pt1.67%Sn催化剂具有最低的焦炭含量，这是由于锡抑制了Pt表面的低配位点，从而保留了更多的活性位点，并在PDH反应过程中维持催化活性。

这些发现强调了调整孔结构和引入适当促进剂的重要性，以提高PDH过程催化剂的稳定性和效率，最终实现更高的产品产率和减少维护需求。

The pore structure of the catalyst support, specifically pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature suggests that the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst enhances coke tolerance and catalytic performance, comparable to monometallic catalysts. This is due to the modification of electronic properties of the Pt surface by tin, which leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support. This results in a significant decrease in the fraction of coke on the Pt metallic phase, diminishing the encapsulation of the Pt metallic phase by coke and keeping more active sites on the Pt metallic phase alive during the reaction. Consequently, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions should consider the pore structure and its influence on coke formation and accommodation, aiming for a balance that maximizes catalytic activity and stability.
