[1] "Catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation are based on Pt/g- Al2O3 because of its low activity for hydrogenolysis; however, this catalyst is susceptible to deactivation by coke deposits occurring under high temperature reaction conditions [4,5]."
[2] "Although Sn is one of the most efficient promoters, deactivation due to coke formation is not completely eliminated, and the catalysts still have a short lifetime and require regeneration to restore activity."
[3] "The XRD and XPS measurements confirmed that coke structure over all spent catalysts was pregraphite-like carbon,which presents at 2u = 258 in XRD patterns and binding energy = 283.9 eV in XPS spectra."
[4] "In the TPO results, along with Sn contents, oxidation peak of coke was shifted to a higher temperature, which can be interpreted that coke formed during the reaction was mainly located on the support in the case of PtSn/ alumina because coke generated on metal surfaces was readily transferred to the support in the presence of Sn."
[5] "Tin addition leads to transfer of coke from the metal to the support,with the ratio of coke fraction on the metal to support deceasing significantly."
[6] "The lowest coke content on the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst is due to inhibition of Sn on low coordination sites on the Pt surface."

The pore structures of the catalyst support play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by influencing coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. Specifically, the pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements of the support affect the efficiency of coke deposition, its spatial distribution within the catalyst bed, and its impact on the catalytic activity. 

Pore size and connectivity enable the diffusion of reactants and products, facilitating the reaction kinetics. Uniformity ensures a consistent distribution of the active sites across the catalyst surface, promoting uniform conversion. Hierarchical arrangements of pores can optimize the balance between diffusion pathways and surface area, enhancing both the reactivity and resistance to coke formation.

In the context of PDH, tin (Sn) as a promoter modifies the electronic properties of platinum (Pt), leading to enhanced coke tolerance and comparable catalytic performance to monometallic catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicate that the coke structure across all spent catalysts is pregraphite-like carbon, with a specific binding energy of 283.9 eV in XPS spectra. 

The presence of tin shifts the coke oxidation temperature to higher values, suggesting that the fraction of coke on the Pt metallic phase is significantly reduced. This shift facilitates the transfer of coke from the metal phase to the support, decreasing the coke content on the metal surface. The Pt1.67%Sn catalyst exhibits the lowest coke content due to the inhibitory effect of tin on the low coordination sites on the Pt surface, thereby preserving a higher proportion of active sites and maintaining catalytic activity during the PDH reaction.

These findings highlight the importance of tailoring the pore structure and incorporating appropriate promoters to enhance the stability and efficiency of catalysts in PDH processes, ultimately leading to improved product yield and reduced maintenance requirements.

催化剂支撑的孔结构在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中起着关键作用，影响焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。特别是，支撑的孔大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响焦炭沉积的效率、其在催化剂床内的空间分布及其对催化活性的影响。

孔径和连通性允许反应物和产物的扩散，促进反应动力学。均匀性确保催化剂表面活性位点的分布一致，促进均匀转化。层次结构的孔可以优化扩散路径与表面积之间的平衡，增强反应性和抗焦炭形成能力。

在PDH的背景下，锡（Sn）作为促进剂修改了铂（Pt）的电子性质，导致增强的焦炭容忍度和与单金属催化剂相当的催化性能。X射线衍射（XRD）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析表明，所有烧焦催化剂中的焦炭结构均为预石墨碳，XPS光谱中的结合能为283.9 eV。

锡的存在使焦炭氧化温度升高，表明Pt金属相中的焦炭比例显著降低。这促进了焦炭从金属相转移到支撑物，减少了金属表面上的焦炭含量。1% Pt1.67%Sn催化剂具有最低的焦炭含量，这是由于锡抑制了Pt表面的低配位点，从而保留了更多的活性位点，并在PDH反应过程中维持催化活性。

这些发现强调了调整孔结构和引入适当促进剂的重要性，以提高PDH过程催化剂的稳定性和效率，最终实现更高的产品产率和减少维护需求。
