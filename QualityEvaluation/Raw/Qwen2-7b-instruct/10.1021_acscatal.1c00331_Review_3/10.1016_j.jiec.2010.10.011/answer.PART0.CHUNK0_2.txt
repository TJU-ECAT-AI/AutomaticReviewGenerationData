[1] "Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[2] "Along with Sn contents, oxidation peak of coke was shifted to a higher temperature, which can be interpreted that coke formed during the reaction was mainly located on the support in the case of PtSn/ alumina because coke generated on metal surfaces was readily transferred to the support in the presence of Sn."
[3] "This would be responsible for high tolerance of PtSn/Al2O3 to catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Tin addition leads to transfer of coke from the metal to the support, with the ratio of coke fraction on the metal to support deceasing significantly."
[5] "The lowest coke content on the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst is due to inhibition of Sn on low coordination sites on the Pt surface."

The pore structures of catalyst supports, particularly their size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pores act as pathways for reactants and products, influencing the reaction kinetics and selectivity. Larger and more interconnected pores facilitate easier access for reactants and products, reducing the risk of clogging and maintaining high catalyst activity. Uniformity ensures consistent performance across the catalyst bed, while hierarchical pore structures offer a balance between diffusion efficiency and resistance, optimizing the PDH process.

The presence of tin in the catalyst modifies the electronic properties of platinum, facilitating the transfer of coke from the metal phase to the support. This reduces the fraction of coke on the metal surface, thereby inhibiting low coordination sites where coke precursors are typically formed. By decreasing the amount of coke on the metal surface, the risk of encapsulating and poisoning active sites is minimized, leading to enhanced catalyst stability and performance.

The design of optimal and effective catalysts thus requires careful consideration of pore structure characteristics. Supports with appropriate pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements can effectively accommodate coke, reduce clogging, and maintain high activity throughout the PDH process. The addition of tin to the catalyst formulation further optimizes this by promoting coke transfer to the support, thereby enhancing catalyst tolerance to deactivation and improving overall performance.

催化剂支撑孔结构，特别是其大小、连通性、均匀性和层次结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能起着关键作用。孔隙充当反应物和产物的通道，影响反应动力学和选择性。较大的孔径和更紧密的连通性有助于简化反应物和产物的访问，降低堵塞风险并保持高催化剂活性。均匀性确保了床层中的一致性能，而层次孔结构提供了一种在扩散效率与阻力之间取得平衡的方式，优化PDH过程。

锡的存在改变了铂的电子性质，促进了焦炭从金属相转移到支撑相。这减少了金属表面的焦炭量，从而抑制了形成焦炭前体的低配位点。通过减少金属表面的焦炭量，降低了覆盖和毒化活性位点的风险，从而提高了催化剂稳定性并改善了整体性能。

因此，在设计最优和有效的催化剂时，需要仔细考虑孔结构特征。具有适当孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构的支持可以有效容纳焦炭，减少堵塞，并在整个PDH过程中保持高活性。添加锡到催化剂配方进一步优化了这一点，通过促进焦炭转移到支撑，从而增强了催化剂对失活的耐受性和改善了总体性能。
