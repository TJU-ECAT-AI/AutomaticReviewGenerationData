<p>The addition of tin into the platinum catalyst reduces the coke content and deactivation rate on the bimetallic PtSn catalyst.</p>
<p>High coordination sites on Pt particles (terraces, steps) are active sites for CH and HH bond breaking while low coordination sites (kinks, edges) are highly active sites for CC bond scission.</p>
<p>Tin inhibits the low coordination sites on platinum particles which are responsible for side reactions producing coke precursors.</p>
<p>For all spent catalysts, the spacing of the line at 2u = 258 (d = 3.56 A) is greater than the line corresponding to graphite carbon (d(0 0 2) = 3.35 A).</p>
<p>This kind of coke can be considered to be a carbon type called pregraphite-like carbon.</p>
<p>The presence of Sn induces the shift of coke oxidation temperature to higher because Sn addition accelerates the transfer of coke to the support.</p>

The pore structure of the catalyst support, specifically pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature suggests that the addition of tin to the platinum catalyst enhances coke tolerance and catalytic performance, comparable to monometallic catalysts. This is due to the modification of electronic properties of the Pt surface by tin, which leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support. This results in a significant decrease in the fraction of coke on the Pt metallic phase, diminishing the encapsulation of the Pt metallic phase by coke and keeping more active sites on the Pt metallic phase alive during the reaction. Consequently, the design of optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions should consider the pore structure and its influence on coke formation and accommodation, aiming for a balance that maximizes catalytic activity and stability.

催化剂支持的孔结构，特别是孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中显著影响焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。文献表明，向铂催化剂中添加锡可以增强焦炭容忍度和催化性能，与单金属催化剂相当。这是由于锡对铂表面电子性质的修改，导致焦炭从金属转移到支撑物。这导致在铂金属相上焦炭的比例显著降低，减少了铂金属相被焦炭封装，并保持更多的活性位点在反应期间活跃。因此，设计PDH反应的最优和有效催化剂时，应考虑孔结构及其对焦炭形成和容纳的影响，旨在实现催化活性和稳定性的最大化平衡。
