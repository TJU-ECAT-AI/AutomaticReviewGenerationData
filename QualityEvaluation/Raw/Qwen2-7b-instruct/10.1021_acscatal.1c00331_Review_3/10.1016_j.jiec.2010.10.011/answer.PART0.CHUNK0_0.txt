[1] "Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[2] "In the TPO results, along with Sn contents, oxidation peak of coke was shifted to a higher temperature, which can be interpreted that coke formed during the reaction was mainly located on the support in the case of PtSn/ alumina because coke generated on metal surfaces was readily transferred to the support in the presence of Sn."
[3] "Our observation is very similar to the data reported by Liwu et al. that investigated dynamic process of carbon deposition on Pt and PtSn supported alumina catalysts used for dehydrogenation of n-butane with H2 adding in the feedstock."
[4] "XRD and XPS analyses reveal that coke from all spent catalysts had the same pregraphite-like carbon structure and was not affected by Sn addition."

1. The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports, including pore size, connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements, play a crucial role in influencing coke formation, accommodation, and the overall performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Proper pore structure can facilitate the efficient transport of reactants and products, minimize the risk of coke formation, and enhance the catalyst's stability and activity. The design of optimal and effective catalysts often involves tailoring the pore structure to match the specific requirements of the PDH process.

2. The addition of tin (Sn) to the catalyst system shifts the coke oxidation peak temperature to a higher temperature in the thermogravimetric analysis of spent catalysts. This suggests that the majority of coke formed during the PDH reaction is located on the support rather than on the metal phase. The electronic effect of tin on the platinum (Pt) surface weakens the interaction between adsorbed hydrocarbon species and the Pt surface, leading to the transfer of coke from the metal to the support. This phenomenon implies that the fraction of coke on the Pt metallic phase is significantly reduced after the addition of tin, which contributes to enhanced catalytic stability.

3. The coke structure on spent catalysts is found to be consistent across different catalyst systems, characterized by a pregraphite-like carbon structure. This finding indicates that the coke formation mechanism is largely independent of the specific metal-support combination, with the pregraphite-like carbon structure being a common feature. The absence of significant influence from the addition of tin on the coke structure suggests that the modification of the coke structure itself is not a primary factor affecting the coke tolerance of the catalysts.

4. The dynamic process of carbon deposition on Pt and PtSn supported alumina catalysts, as investigated by Liwu et al., demonstrates similarities to the observed behavior in propane dehydrogenation. The data from these studies highlight the importance of understanding the kinetics of coke formation and the factors influencing its location on the catalyst surface. This knowledge can inform the development of strategies to optimize catalyst design, reduce coke formation, and enhance the overall efficiency and longevity of PDH processes.

1. 催化剂支撑的孔结构特性，包括孔径、连通性、均匀性和层级结构，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中对焦炭形成、容纳和催化剂整体性能产生重要影响。合理的孔结构有助于有效促进反应物和产物的传输，减少焦炭形成的风险，并增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。设计最优且有效的催化剂通常涉及根据PDH过程的具体需求调整孔结构。

2. 锡（Sn）的添加使在热重分析中测试的废弃催化剂上的焦炭氧化峰温度升高。这表明PDH反应中形成的大部分焦炭位于支撑材料上而非金属相。锡在铂（Pt）表面的电子效应减弱了吸附烃物种与Pt表面之间的相互作用，导致焦炭从金属转移到支撑材料。这一现象表明，添加锡后Pt金属相中的焦炭含量显著降低，从而有助于提高催化剂稳定性。

3. 在废弃催化剂上的焦炭结构被发现是一致的，特征为预石墨碳结构。这一发现表明焦炭形成机制在不同催化剂系统之间相对独立，预石墨碳结构是常见特征。焦炭结构不受锡添加显著影响的发现表明，修改焦炭结构本身不是影响催化剂焦炭耐受性的主要因素。

4. 李武等人的研究揭示了Pt和PtSn支持氧化铝催化剂上碳沉积的动态过程与PDH过程中观察到的行为有相似之处。这些数据强调了理解焦炭形成动力学以及影响其在催化剂表面位置的因素的重要性。这些知识可以指导优化催化剂设计策略、减少焦炭形成并提高PDH过程的整体效率。
