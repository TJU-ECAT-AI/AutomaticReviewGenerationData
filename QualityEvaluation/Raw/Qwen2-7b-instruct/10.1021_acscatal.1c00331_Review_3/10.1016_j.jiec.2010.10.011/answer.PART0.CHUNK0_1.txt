2.2. Catalyst characterization
Coke on spent catalysts was measured by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments Q50). Approximately 10.0 mg of spent catalyst was charged into the sample pan, and then was heated to 700 8C at a rate of 40 8C/min in a flow of air. The coke content, based on a dried sample of each catalyst, was calculated after subtracting the water content.
2.3. Catalytic deactivation test
Dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a quartz fixed-bed reactor flow system at atmospheric pressure. For all experiments,the catalyst (100 mg) was previously reduced with a flow (50 ml/ min) of pure H2 at 600 8C for 2 h and purged to remove H2 gas remaining in the reactor for 10 min with a flow (100 ml/min) of N2.
Then the reaction mixture consisting of N2 (100 ml/min) and C3H8 (30 ml/min) was fed into the reactor at 600 8C. The flow rate of each gas was controlled by a mass-flow-controller that had been previously calibrated. Beginning 1 min from the start of the reaction, the product of the reaction was sampled at time intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC).

The coke content was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a TA Instruments Q50 apparatus. The coke was heated at a rate of 40°C/min in a flow of air until reaching 700°C. The coke content was calculated based on the weight loss of the dried catalyst sample after subtracting the water content. Propane dehydrogenation experiments were conducted in a quartz fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was reduced with a hydrogen flow at 600°C for 2 hours and then flushed with nitrogen to remove residual hydrogen. The reaction mixture containing nitrogen and propane was introduced into the reactor at 600°C. The gas flow rates were controlled using a mass-flow controller. Samples of the reaction product were collected at regular intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography.

通过TA仪器Q50热重分析仪对废弃催化剂进行了焦炭含量的测定。将10.0毫克废弃催化剂装入样品盘中，并以每分钟40°C的速率在空气流中加热至700°C。根据干燥催化剂样品的重量损失，减去水分含量后计算出焦炭含量。在常压下，在石英固定床反应器中进行丙烷脱氢实验。催化剂在600°C下用氢气流还原2小时，然后用氮气冲洗以去除残留氢气。氮气和丙烷的反应混合物以600°C引入反应器中。气体流速使用质量流量控制器控制。在定期间隔收集反应产物样本，并通过气相色谱法对其进行分析。

3.2. Coke structure
Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of fresh and spent catalysts of 1% Pt and 1% Pt1.67% Sn. Four patterns from (a) to (d) display three distinct peaks at 2u = 38, 46, and 678, which agree with the standard for g-Al2O3 (JCPDS No. 29-1486). These peaks have obviously strong intensities indicating that g-Al2O3 has a good crystallinity. The platinum, tin, and intermetallic phases are not detected in the fresh and spent catalysts. This indicates either that Pt, Sn, and intermetallic species are well dispersed on the g-Al2O3 after reduction and are not sintered after reaction or that the small crystallite size is below the limit of XRD detection. The similarity of the gamma phase of Al2O3 in the XRD patterns between fresh and spent catalysts indicates that the structure of the alumina support did not change after the reaction.

Figure 3 illustrates the XRD patterns of fresh and spent catalysts containing 1% Pt and 1% Pt1.67% Sn. Patterns (a) through (d) exhibit three distinct peaks at 2u = 38°, 46°, and 67.8°, matching the standard for gamma-alumina (JCPDS No. 29-1486). These peaks have high intensity, indicating that gamma-alumina has good crystallinity. Neither platinum, tin, nor intermetallic phases were detected in the fresh and spent catalysts. This suggests that platinum, tin, and intermetallic species are well dispersed on gamma-alumina after reduction and do not fuse post-reaction, or that the small crystal size falls below XRD detection limits. The similarity of the gamma phase of alumina in the XRD patterns of both fresh and spent catalysts indicates that the alumina support's structure remained unchanged after the reaction.

图3显示了含1%铂和1% Pt1.67%Sn的新鲜和废弃催化剂的XRD模式。从(a)到(d)的模式显示了在38°、46°和67.8°处的三个明显的峰，与γ-氧化铝的标准(JCPDS编号29-1486)相符。这些峰具有很高的强度，表明γ-氧化铝具有良好的结晶性。新鲜和废弃催化剂中的铂、锡和互金属相均未检测到。这表明铂、锡和互金属物种在还原后均匀分散在γ-氧化铝上，并且在反应后没有发生烧结，或者是因为晶体尺寸较小而低于XRD检测极限。新鲜和废弃催化剂的XRD模式中γ-氧化铝的相似性表明，反应后氧化铝支持结构保持不变。

3.3. Coke location
The TGA technique allows a determination of the coke location on supported metal catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 6.
Two successive peaks are observed in the TGA profile of 1% Pt-spent catalysts after deactivation for 160 min on stream. The TGA profile was fitted using Gaussian curves to determine the temperature of the first and second oxidation peaks (at the shoulder). At least two peaks are observed in the TPO profile of the four spent catalysts and the portion of the peaks is dependent on Sn contents; the oxidation temperatures of the main peaks are shifted from 465 to 513 8C.
