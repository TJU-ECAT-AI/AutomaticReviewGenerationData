Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of these materials encompass mesoporous, macroporous, and hybrid zeolites. Synthesis methods for these materials include sol-gel, template-assisted, and co-precipitation techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve PDH reaction performance due to increased surface area, optimized pore structure, and precise control over pore size.
