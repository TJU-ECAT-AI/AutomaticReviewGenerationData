1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials are mesoporous-silica-zeolite hybrids and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) encapsulated within zeolites. Synthesis techniques usually encompass impregnation, co-precipitation, or sol-gel processes. These materials outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reactions because of their increased surface area, precisely controlled pore size, and superior encapsulation of active metals.
