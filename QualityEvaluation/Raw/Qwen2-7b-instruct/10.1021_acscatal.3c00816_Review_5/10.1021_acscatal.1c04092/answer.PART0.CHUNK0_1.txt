1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials are mesoporous-silica-zeolite hybrids and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) encapsulated within zeolites. Synthesis techniques usually encompass impregnation, co-precipitation, or sol-gel processes. These materials outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reactions because of their increased surface area, precisely controlled pore size, and superior encapsulation of active metals.

1. 分级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可达性。这类材料的主要类型包括介孔二氧化硅沸石杂化物和封装在沸石中的金属有机框架（MOF）。合成方法通常涉及浸渍、共沉淀或溶胶-凝胶过程。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在PDH反应中的性能更优，原因在于其增加的表面积、精确控制的孔径大小以及对活性金属的更好封装。
