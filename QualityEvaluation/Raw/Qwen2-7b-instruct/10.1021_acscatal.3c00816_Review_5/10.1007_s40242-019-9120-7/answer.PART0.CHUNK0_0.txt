[1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
[2] "This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction."
[3] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
[4] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

1. The hierarchical zeolite TS-1@SBA-16 combines micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a hierarchical porous structure that facilitates efficient mass transfer.
2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include TS-1 and SBA-16, which are synthesized by encapsulating TS-1 zeolite crystals within mesoporous SBA-16 silica. These materials improve PDH reaction performance due to their unique hierarchical porous structures, suitable acid properties, and electronic effects from titanium species.
3. Compared to traditional zeolites, the hierarchical zeolite composite TS-1@SBA-16 shows superior catalytic performance in PDH reactions, with an optimal TS-1 content of 10% achieving an initial propane conversion rate of 54.5%, surpassing catalysts supported by either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone.

1. 级联型沸石TS-1@SBA-16通过提供层次结构多孔结构来增强PDH反应的可接近性，该结构有助于高效的质量传递。
2. 级联型沸石的主要类型包括TS-1和SBA-16，它们通过包裹TS-1沸石晶体在微孔SBA-16硅胶中合成。这些材料由于其独特的层次结构多孔结构、适宜的酸性质以及钛物种的电子效应，提高了PDH反应的性能。
3. 相比传统的沸石，级联型复合沸石TS-1@SBA-16在PDH反应中表现出更优越的催化性能，当TS-1含量为10%时，初始丙烷转化率可达54.5%，超过了仅由TS-1或SBA-16支持的催化剂。
