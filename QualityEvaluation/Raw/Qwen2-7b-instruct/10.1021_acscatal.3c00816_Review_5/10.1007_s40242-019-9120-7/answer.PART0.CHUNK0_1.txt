[1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
[2] "This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction."
[3] "Catalysts were characterized by means of N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, TEM XPS, UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy."
[4] "The effect of different contents of TS-1 on PDH was investigated, and the optimal amount of TS-1 was determined to be 10%."
[5] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
[6] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level structure that improves mass transfer efficiency. This allows for better interaction between the reactants and the catalyst surface. The main types of these materials include novel composites like TS-1@SBA-16, which is synthesized by encapsulating TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. The synthesis method involves wrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with SBA-16 silica to create a composite material that functions as a catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the PDH reaction. Compared to traditional zeolites, this hierarchical structure improves PDH reaction performance due to its enhanced mass transfer properties, suitable acidity, and electronic effects of Ti species. The study found that an optimal TS-1 content of 10% results in the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial conversion of propane at 54.5%, surpassing other TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts.

这些分级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供多层次结构来增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而提高了质量传输效率。这使得反应物与催化剂表面之间的交互作用更好。这类材料的主要类型包括像TS-1@SBA-16这样的新型复合材料，它是通过将TS-1沸石晶体包裹在多孔SBA-16二氧化硅中合成的。合成方法涉及用SBA-16二氧化硅包裹TS-1沸石晶体以创建作为负载Pt-SnOx的催化剂支持材料的复合材料，在PDH反应中使用。与传统沸石相比，由于其增强的质量传输特性、适当的酸性以及Ti物种的电子效应，这种层次结构提高了PDH反应性能。研究表明，TS-1含量为10%时，PDH活性最高，丙烷的初始转化率达到54.5%，超过其他TS-1或SBA-16支持的催化剂。
