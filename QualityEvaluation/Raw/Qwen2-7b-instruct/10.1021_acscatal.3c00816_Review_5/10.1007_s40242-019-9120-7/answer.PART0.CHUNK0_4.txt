[1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
[2] "This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction."
[3] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
[4] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a highly interconnected pore network that facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products. This structure allows for better mass transfer and increased surface area, which improves the efficiency of the PDH reaction. The main types of these materials are TS-1 and SBA-16, both of which are synthesized through specific chemical processes that yield their unique hierarchical structures. Compared to traditional zeolites, the TS-1@SBA-16 composite shows superior catalytic performance due to its synergistic effect, which includes enhanced mass transfer, appropriate acidity, and electronic effects provided by titanium species.
