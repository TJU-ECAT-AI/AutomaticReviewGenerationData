[1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
[2] "This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction."
[3] "The effect of different contents of TS-1 on PDH was investigated, and the optimal amount of TS-1 was determined to be 10%."
[4] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
[5] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level pore system that facilitates better mass transfer, allowing reactants to reach the active sites more efficiently.
2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are TS-1 and SBA-16. TS-1 is a mesoporous material, while SBA-16 is a mesoporous silica. They are synthesized through specific methods that involve templating agents and polymerization processes to create ordered mesoporous structures.
3. Compared to traditional zeolites, the use of hierarchical zeolites such as TS-1@SBA-16 in PDH reactions improves performance due to their enhanced mass transfer capabilities, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effects provided by Ti species. These factors contribute to higher activity and efficiency in the propane dehydrogenation process.

1. 分级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供多级孔隙系统来增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而促进更好的质量传输，使反应物更有效地达到活性位点。
2. 主要的分级沸石类型包括TS-1和SBA-16。TS-1是一种介孔材料，而SBA-16是介孔二氧化硅。它们通过特定的方法合成，涉及模板剂和聚合过程，以创建有序的介孔结构。
3. 相比传统的沸石，在PDH反应中使用如TS-1@SBA-16这样的分级沸石可以提高性能，由于其增强的质量传输能力、适当的酸性以及Ti物种提供的电子效应。这些因素有助于提高丙烷脱氢过程的活性和效率。
