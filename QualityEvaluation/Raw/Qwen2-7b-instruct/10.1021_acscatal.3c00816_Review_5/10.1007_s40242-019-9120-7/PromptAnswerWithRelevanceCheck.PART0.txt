The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level structure that improves mass transfer efficiency. This allows for better interaction between the reactants and the catalyst surface. The main types of these materials include novel composites like TS-1@SBA-16, which is synthesized by encapsulating TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. The synthesis method involves wrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with SBA-16 silica to create a composite material that functions as a catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the PDH reaction. Compared to traditional zeolites, this hierarchical structure improves PDH reaction performance due to its enhanced mass transfer properties, suitable acidity, and electronic effects of Ti species. The study found that an optimal TS-1 content of 10% results in the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial conversion of propane at 54.5%, surpassing other TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts.
