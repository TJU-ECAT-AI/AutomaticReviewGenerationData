Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. This method prevents the sintering of metal nanoclusters during conventional calcination-reduction processes, leading to the formation of subnanometer metal clusters. Additionally, incorporating Cs+ ions into the zeolite structure enhances the catalyst's regeneration stability, allowing the catalytic activity to remain constant even after multiple cycles of use.
