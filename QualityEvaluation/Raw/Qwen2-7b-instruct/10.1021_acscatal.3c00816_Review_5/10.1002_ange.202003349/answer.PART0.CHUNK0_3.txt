<p>Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs.2c, 3, 5 However, supporting metal species on zeolites by using conventional impregnation methods usually generates large metal particles with poor dispersion.</p>
<p>Iglesia and co-workers employed a ligand-stabilized method to confine various types of small MNPs (12nm) within aluminosilicate zeolites, and the resulting materials showed excellent resistance to sintering.5b, 6</p>
<p>The design of supported bimetallic catalysts by alloying Pt with various metallic elements, such as Sn,8 Ga,2d, 4c, 9 Cu,2b Fe,2f and Zn,2g, 2h is also considered an effective strategy to enhance the stability of Pt species and propylene selectivity in PDH conversions, but the stability and catalytic efficiency of these catalysts remain to be improved.</p>
<p>Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters.</p>
<p>The resulting PtZn@S-1 catalysts are superefficient for PDH conversions. The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C, and 40.4% propane conversion was retained even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2. In contrast, the propane conversion over mono-metallic Pt@S-1-H and Pt@S-1-C (treated by conventional calcination/reduction process) sharply declined to 19.8% and 2% within 2900 and 340min on stream, respectively. Significantly, the deactivation constant of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst was as low as 0.001h1, which was 200 times lower than that of Pt-Zn/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions.</p>
<p>Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles.</p>
<p>To obtain detailed structural information about the metal species in zeolites, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the as-prepared samples were measured (Figure2 and FigureS12, TableS2).</p>
<p>The crystallinity of the zeolite remained unchanged (FigureS45).</p>
<p>The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H (FigureS46 and TableS4).</p>
<p>Significantly, we for the first time found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can remarkably enhance the regeneration stability of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing more pathways for reactants and products to enter and exit the zeolite matrix. This increases the surface area available for catalytic reactions and improves the diffusion of reactants and products, thereby enhancing the performance of PDH reactions.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MWW, and BEA zeotypes, which are synthesized through hydrothermal crystallization. The synthesis involves controlling the synthesis conditions such as temperature, pH, and reactant concentration to produce zeolites with desired pore structures. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering a better balance between pore size and connectivity, which enhances the efficiency of the catalytic process.

3. The improvement in PDH reaction performance is attributed to the combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical zeolites. Micropores allow for high surface area and efficient adsorption of reactants, while mesopores and macropores facilitate easier diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the diffusion limitations that can occur in zeolites with solely micropore structures. This leads to a higher conversion rate and selectivity for propylene production, making hierarchical zeolites particularly suitable for PDH reactions.

1. 层级沸石通过提供更多的通道来增强PDH反应的可访问性，这些通道允许反应物和产物进入并离开沸石矩阵。这增加了可用于催化反应的表面积，并改善了反应物和产物的扩散，从而提高了PDH反应的性能。

2. 层级沸石的主要类型包括MFI、MWW和BEA型，通过水热结晶合成。合成过程涉及控制合成条件，如温度、pH值和反应物浓度，以生产具有所需孔结构的沸石。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供更好的孔尺寸和连通性平衡，从而增强催化过程的效率，提高PDH反应的性能。

3. PDH反应性能的改善归因于层级沸石中微孔、介孔和大孔的组合。微孔提供了高比表面和高效的反应物吸附能力，而介孔和大孔则有利于反应物和产物的更顺畅扩散，减少了仅由微孔结构引起的扩散限制。这导致更高的转化率和丙烯选择性，使得层级沸石特别适合PDH反应。
