<p>Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs.</p>
<p>Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of catalysts, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four continuous cycles.</p>
<p>Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions.</p>
<p>Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts.</p>
<p>The introduction of Zn species can remarkably promote the catalytic activity and stability of Pt clusters through to the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. They improve performance by providing a larger surface area and more accessible active sites for the reaction. Zeolites are synthesized through methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal crystallization, and ion-exchange. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical materials offer enhanced stability and activity for PDH reactions due to their optimized pore structures and confinement effects provided by zeolite frameworks.

2. The synthesis of bimetallic PtZn clusters involves ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction encapsulation within silicalite-1 zeolites. This method leads to smaller metal species and energy-efficient production. The Zn species significantly improve the stability of the Pt clusters, leading to high propylene selectivity and activity, even under long-term operation without hydrogen co-feeding. The introduction of Cs+ ions enhances regeneration stability, keeping catalytic activity unchanged after multiple cycles.

3. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibits exceptional performance for PDH conversions. It features high propylene selectivity (99.3%), high specific activity (65.5 mol gPt-1h-1), and remarkable stability with no deactivation observed after 13000 minutes of operation (WHSV=3.6h-1). The catalyst maintains 40.4% propane conversion and 99.2% propylene selectivity. This stability surpasses other Pt-based catalysts under similar conditions. The PtZn@zeolite catalysts demonstrate superior performance for PDH conversions, surpassing state-of-the-art supported Pt-based catalysts.

4. The PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs catalyst shows remarkable regeneration stability. After four successive regeneration cycles, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity remain unchanged, indicating the effectiveness of Cs+ ions in inhibiting metal migration and aggregation, thereby improving the regeneration stability of the catalyst. This is evidenced by Cs-corrected STEM images showing the retention of subnanometer metal clusters and uniform distribution of metals within the zeolite crystals.

1. 层级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过提供更大的表面积和更易访问的活性位点来改善性能。沸石是通过溶胶-凝胶法、水热结晶化和离子交换等方法合成的。与传统沸石相比，这些层级材料由于其优化的孔结构和由沸石框架提供的限制效果，为PDH反应提供了增强的稳定性和活性。

2. 铂锌双金属簇的合成涉及在硅铝酸盐沸石内使用配体保护的直接氢还原封装。这种方法导致较小的金属物种和能量效率高的生产。锌物种显著提高了铂簇的稳定性，导致高丙烯选择性和活性，即使在长时间运行且不使用氢气的情况下也是如此。引入Cs+离子增强了再生稳定性，保持催化活性不变，即使经过多次循环后也是如此。

3. PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂表现出PDH转化的出色性能。它具有99.3%的高丙烯选择性、高达65.5 mol gPt-1h-1的高特定活性，并且显示出出色的稳定性，未观察到降解现象，即使在13000分钟后（WHSV=3.6h-1）也未发现明显失活。催化剂保持40.4%的丙烷转化率和99.2%的丙烯选择性。这种稳定性远超过其他基于铂的催化剂，在相似条件下。PtZn@沸石催化剂在PDH转化方面表现优异，超过了最先进的基于铂的催化剂。

4. PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs催化剂显示了出色的再生稳定性。经过四次连续再生循环后，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性保持不变，表明Cs+离子在抑制金属迁移和聚合，从而提高催化剂再生稳定性方面的有效性。这在Cs-corrected STEM图像中得到证实，这些图像显示了亚纳米金属簇的保留以及金属在整个沸石晶体中的均匀分布。
