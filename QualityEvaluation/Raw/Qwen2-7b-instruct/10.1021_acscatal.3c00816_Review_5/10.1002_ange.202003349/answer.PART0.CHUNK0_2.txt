[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "Significantly, the introduction of Zn species can remarkably promote the catalytic activity and stability of Pt clusters through to the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters."
[3] "The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C."
[4] "No obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), the highest stability to date among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction."

1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve accessibility for PDH reactions.
2. The introduction of zinc species notably enhances the catalytic activity and stability of platinum clusters by forming ultra-small platinum-zinc alloy clusters.
3. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst demonstrated a high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5 mol/g Pt/h) at a WHSV of 108h1, alongside a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550°C.
4. The catalyst maintained high stability without obvious deactivation after 13000 hours of operation at a WHSV of 3.6h1, marking the highest stability among current Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for PDH reactions.

1. 级联沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。
2. 锌元素的引入显著提高了铂簇的催化活性和稳定性，通过形成超小的铂锌合金簇。
3. PtZn4@S-1-H 催化剂在108h1的空速下表现出65.5 mol/g Pt/h的高丙烯生成特定活性，并在550°C时具有99.3%的丙烯选择性。
4. 在3.6小时1的空速下运行13000小时后，催化剂未出现明显的失活现象，这是迄今为止所有最先进的PDH反应用Pt基异质催化剂中稳定性最高的一种。
