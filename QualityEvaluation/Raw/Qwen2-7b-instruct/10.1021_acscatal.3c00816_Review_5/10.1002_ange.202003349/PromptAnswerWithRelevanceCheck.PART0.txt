Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. This method prevents the sintering of metal nanoclusters during conventional calcination-reduction processes, leading to the formation of subnanometer metal clusters. Additionally, incorporating Cs+ ions into the zeolite structure enhances the catalyst's regeneration stability, allowing the catalytic activity to remain constant even after multiple cycles of use.

1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. They improve performance by providing a larger surface area and more accessible active sites for the reaction. Zeolites are synthesized through methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal crystallization, and ion-exchange. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical materials offer enhanced stability and activity for PDH reactions due to their optimized pore structures and confinement effects provided by zeolite frameworks.

2. The synthesis of bimetallic PtZn clusters involves ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction encapsulation within silicalite-1 zeolites. This method leads to smaller metal species and energy-efficient production. The Zn species significantly improve the stability of the Pt clusters, leading to high propylene selectivity and activity, even under long-term operation without hydrogen co-feeding. The introduction of Cs+ ions enhances regeneration stability, keeping catalytic activity unchanged after multiple cycles.

3. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibits exceptional performance for PDH conversions. It features high propylene selectivity (99.3%), high specific activity (65.5 mol gPt-1h-1), and remarkable stability with no deactivation observed after 13000 minutes of operation (WHSV=3.6h-1). The catalyst maintains 40.4% propane conversion and 99.2% propylene selectivity. This stability surpasses other Pt-based catalysts under similar conditions. The PtZn@zeolite catalysts demonstrate superior performance for PDH conversions, surpassing state-of-the-art supported Pt-based catalysts.

4. The PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs catalyst shows remarkable regeneration stability. After four successive regeneration cycles, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity remain unchanged, indicating the effectiveness of Cs+ ions in inhibiting metal migration and aggregation, thereby improving the regeneration stability of the catalyst. This is evidenced by Cs-corrected STEM images showing the retention of subnanometer metal clusters and uniform distribution of metals within the zeolite crystals.

1. 层级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过提供更大的表面积和更易访问的活性位点来改善性能。沸石是通过溶胶-凝胶法、水热结晶化和离子交换等方法合成的。与传统沸石相比，这些层级材料由于其优化的孔结构和由沸石框架提供的限制效果，为PDH反应提供了增强的稳定性和活性。

2. 铂锌双金属簇的合成涉及在硅铝酸盐沸石内使用配体保护的直接氢还原封装。这种方法导致较小的金属物种和能量效率高的生产。锌物种显著提高了铂簇的稳定性，导致高丙烯选择性和活性，即使在长时间运行且不使用氢气的情况下也是如此。引入Cs+离子增强了再生稳定性，保持催化活性不变，即使经过多次循环后也是如此。

3. PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂表现出PDH转化的出色性能。它具有99.3%的高丙烯选择性、高达65.5 mol gPt-1h-1的高特定活性，并且显示出出色的稳定性，未观察到降解现象，即使在13000分钟后（WHSV=3.6h-1）也未发现明显失活。催化剂保持40.4%的丙烷转化率和99.2%的丙烯选择性。这种稳定性远超过其他基于铂的催化剂，在相似条件下。PtZn@沸石催化剂在PDH转化方面表现优异，超过了最先进的基于铂的催化剂。

4. PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs催化剂显示了出色的再生稳定性。经过四次连续再生循环后，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性保持不变，表明Cs+离子在抑制金属迁移和聚合，从而提高催化剂再生稳定性方面的有效性。这在Cs-corrected STEM图像中得到证实，这些图像显示了亚纳米金属簇的保留以及金属在整个沸石晶体中的均匀分布。

<p>Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs.2c, 3, 5 However, supporting metal species on zeolites by using conventional impregnation methods usually generates large metal particles with poor dispersion.</p>
<p>Iglesia and co-workers employed a ligand-stabilized method to confine various types of small MNPs (12nm) within aluminosilicate zeolites, and the resulting materials showed excellent resistance to sintering.5b, 6</p>
<p>The design of supported bimetallic catalysts by alloying Pt with various metallic elements, such as Sn,8 Ga,2d, 4c, 9 Cu,2b Fe,2f and Zn,2g, 2h is also considered an effective strategy to enhance the stability of Pt species and propylene selectivity in PDH conversions, but the stability and catalytic efficiency of these catalysts remain to be improved.</p>
<p>Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters.</p>
<p>The resulting PtZn@S-1 catalysts are superefficient for PDH conversions. The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C, and 40.4% propane conversion was retained even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2. In contrast, the propane conversion over mono-metallic Pt@S-1-H and Pt@S-1-C (treated by conventional calcination/reduction process) sharply declined to 19.8% and 2% within 2900 and 340min on stream, respectively.

<p>The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H (FigureS46 and TableS4).</p>
<p>Significantly, we for the first time found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can remarkably enhance the regeneration stability of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing more pathways for reactants and products to enter and exit the zeolite matrix. This increases the surface area available for catalytic reactions and improves the diffusion of reactants and products, thereby enhancing the performance of PDH reactions.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MWW, and BEA zeotypes, which are synthesized through hydrothermal crystallization. The synthesis involves controlling the synthesis conditions such as temperature, pH, and reactant concentration to produce zeolites with desired pore structures. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering a better balance between pore size and connectivity, which enhances the efficiency of the catalytic process.

3. The improvement in PDH reaction performance is attributed to the combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical zeolites. Micropores allow for high surface area and efficient adsorption of reactants, while mesopores and macropores facilitate easier diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the diffusion limitations that can occur in zeolites with solely micropore structures. This leads to a higher conversion rate and selectivity for propylene production, making hierarchical zeolites particularly suitable for PDH reactions.

1. 层级沸石通过提供更多的通道来增强PDH反应的可访问性，这些通道允许反应物和产物进入并离开沸石矩阵。这增加了可用于催化反应的表面积，并改善了反应物和产物的扩散，从而提高了PDH反应的性能。

2. 层级沸石的主要类型包括MFI、MWW和BEA型，通过水热结晶合成。合成过程涉及控制合成条件，如温度、pH值和反应物浓度，以生产具有所需孔结构的沸石。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供更好的孔尺寸和连通性平衡，从而增强催化过程的效率，提高PDH反应的性能。

3. PDH反应性能的改善归因于层级沸石中微孔、介孔和大孔的组合。微孔提供了高比表面和高效的反应物吸附能力，而介孔和大孔则有利于反应物和产物的更顺畅扩散，减少了仅由微孔结构引起的扩散限制。这导致更高的转化率和丙烯选择性，使得层级沸石特别适合PDH反应。
