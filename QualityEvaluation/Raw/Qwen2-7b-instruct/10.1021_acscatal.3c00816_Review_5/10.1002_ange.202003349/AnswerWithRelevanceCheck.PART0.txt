          [1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [2] "Such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters."
          [3] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles."
          [4] "Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [5] "Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs."

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. They improve performance by providing a larger surface area and more accessible active sites for the reaction. Zeolites are synthesized through methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal crystallization, and ion-exchange. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical materials offer enhanced stability and activity for PDH reactions due to their optimized pore structures and confinement effects provided by zeolite frameworks.

          [1] "Significantly, the introduction of Zn species can remarkably promote the catalytic activity and stability of Pt clusters through to the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters."
          [2] "The resulting PtZn@S-1 catalysts are superefficient for PDH conversions."
          [3] "The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C."
          [4] "No obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), the highest stability to date among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction."

          The introduction of zinc species notably enhances the catalytic activity and stability of platinum clusters by forming ultra-small platinum-zinc alloy clusters. The developed PtZn@S-1 catalysts exhibit exceptional efficiency in PDH conversions. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst demonstrates a high specific activity in propylene formation (65.5 mol/g Pt/h) at a WHSV of 108h1, alongside a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550°C. The catalyst maintains high stability without obvious deactivation after 13000 hours of operation at a WHSV of 3.6h1, marking the highest stability among current Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for PDH reactions.
