Hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores and either mesopores or macropores. Main types include mesoporous-zeolite hybrids and macroporous-zeolite composites. Synthesis methods typically involve template-directed incorporation or specific conditions. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve PDH reaction performance due to enhanced surface area and better diffusion pathways.

层状沸石通过结合微孔和介孔或大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括介孔沸石杂化物和大孔沸石复合物。合成方法通常涉及模板导向的掺入或特定条件。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在提高PDH反应性能方面表现出优势，这是由于增强了表面积和更好的反应物和产物扩散途径。
