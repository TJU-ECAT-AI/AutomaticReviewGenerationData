<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores or macropores to increase accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of hierarchical zeolites are MFI, MEL, and BEA structures. Synthesis methods usually involve template-directed assembly or sol-gel processes. These materials outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reaction efficiency because of their increased surface area and pore architecture.
