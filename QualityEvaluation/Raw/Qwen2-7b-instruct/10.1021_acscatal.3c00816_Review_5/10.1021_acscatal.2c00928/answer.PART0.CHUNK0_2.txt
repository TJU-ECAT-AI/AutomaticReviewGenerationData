Answer: Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactants to interact with the catalyst. The main types of these materials include silicalite-1, which is known for its high stability and activity in PDH reactions. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal processes or sol-gel techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reactions' performance due to their enhanced pore structures, leading to better diffusion of reactants and products, reduced coke formation, and improved selectivity and stability.

答案：层次沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而提供更大的反应物与催化剂接触的表面积。这些材料的主要类型包括硅铝沸石-1，它在PDH反应中因其高稳定性和活性而闻名。合成方法通常涉及水热过程或溶胶-凝胶技术。与传统沸石相比，层次沸石在提高PDH反应性能方面具有优势，主要是由于其增强的孔结构，这有助于更好地扩散反应物和产物，减少焦炭形成，并提高选择性和稳定性。
