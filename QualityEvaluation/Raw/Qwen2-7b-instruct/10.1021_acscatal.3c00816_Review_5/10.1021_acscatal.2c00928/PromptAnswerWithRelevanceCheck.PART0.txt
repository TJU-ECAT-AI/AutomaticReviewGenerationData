Answer: Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products to diffuse through. This allows for more efficient interactions within the zeolite framework, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. The main types of these materials typically include modified versions of natural zeolites (like SiO2-Al2O3) and synthetic zeolites tailored for specific applications. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal processes, ion exchange, and template-directed assembly, which enable precise control over pore size and topology. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved selectivity, stability, and activity due to their optimized pore architecture and enhanced accessibility properties.

答案：分层沸石通过提供更大的表面积和更多的路径，增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而提高催化活性。这允许在沸石框架内进行更有效的相互作用，进而实现更高效的催化性能。这些材料的主要类型通常包括对天然沸石（如SiO2-Al2O3）的修改版本和为特定应用定制的合成沸石。合成方法通常涉及水热过程、离子交换和模板导向组装，这些方法能够精确控制孔径大小和拓扑结构。与传统沸石相比，分层沸石由于其优化的孔隙架构和增强的可接近性特性，提供了改进的选择性、稳定性和活性。

Answer: Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactants to interact with the catalyst. The main types of these materials include silicalite-1, which is known for its high stability and activity in PDH reactions. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal processes or sol-gel techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reactions' performance due to their enhanced pore structures, leading to better diffusion of reactants and products, reduced coke formation, and improved selectivity and stability.
