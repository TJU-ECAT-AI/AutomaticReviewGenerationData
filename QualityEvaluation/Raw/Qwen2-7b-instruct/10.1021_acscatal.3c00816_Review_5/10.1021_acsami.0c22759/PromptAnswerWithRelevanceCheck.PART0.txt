<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions through their unique pore structure. The micropores offer high surface area for adsorption, while the mesopores and macropores provide pathways for gas diffusion, thus improving the dispersion of the CrOx catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.
2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include templated and non-templated zeolites, as well as those synthesized via hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and microwave-assisted synthesis. These methods allow for precise control over the pore size distribution, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and stability.
3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show improved performance in PDH reactions due to their optimized pore architecture, which facilitates better interaction between the catalyst and reactants, reduces coke formation, and increases the reaction rate and yield.

1. 层状沸石通过其独特的孔隙结构结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而提高PDH反应的可接近性。微孔提供了高表面积用于吸附，而介孔和大孔则提供气体扩散的通道，从而改善CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢化中的分散。
2. 层状沸石的主要类型包括模板法和非模板法合成的沸石，以及通过水热处理、溶胶-凝胶过程和微波辅助合成的方法。这些方法允许对孔径分布进行精确控制，从而提高催化活性和稳定性。
3. 相比传统沸石，层状沸石在PDH反应中表现出改进的性能，由于其优化的孔结构，它能够更好地促进催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用，减少焦炭形成，并增加反应速率和产率。
