1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types are HZSM-5, HZSM-11, and HZSM-35. These materials enhance PDH reaction performance by offering more active sites and improved gas diffusion, resulting in increased selectivity and stability compared to conventional zeolites.
