[1] "To sum up, the complexity and uncontrollability in the chemical speciations of active phases (from isolated species, polymeric species to nanoclusters) on different supports have been always a roadblock for the further exploration of PDH reaction."
[2] "The catalytic stabilities of catalysts strongly rely on the structural properties of metal active phases on the supports."
[3] "For instance, large Co3O4 crystallites formed over the CoOx/Al2O3 are easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of propane cracking reactions."
[4] "However, if the CoOx species are confined into the silanols of SiBeta support, the ultrasmall metallic Co formed in situ during the PDH reaction can become dehydrogenation active sites."
[5] "A series of as-prepared catalysts are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), H2 pulse chemisorption, in situ Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (in situ FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, etc., to gain deep insight into the physico-chemical properties."
[6] "Moreover, possible reaction mechanism of propane on the bimetallic site is further investigated to better understand the stability of novel NiZn-S-1 catalyst."

1. The complexity and unpredictability in the chemical forms of active components on various supports have always hindered the progress in exploring PDH reactions.
2. The stability of catalysts is largely dependent on the structural characteristics of their active metal components on the support surfaces.
3. For example, large Co3O4 particles on the surface of CoOx/Al2O3 catalysts can easily transform into metallic Co particles, promoting propane cracking reactions.
4. However, when CoOx species are confined within the silanols of SiBeta supports, the in-situ formed tiny metallic Co can function as dehydrogenation active sites during PDH reactions.
5. Various advanced characterization techniques, including TEM, XPS, H2-TPR, H2 pulse chemisorption, in situ FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy, are utilized to thoroughly analyze the physical and chemical properties of the synthesized catalysts.
6. Furthermore, the potential reaction pathways of propane over the bimetallic site are explored to gain a deeper understanding of the stability of the novel NiZn-S-1 catalyst.

1. 复杂性和不可控性在不同支持材料上活性组分的化学形式（从孤立物种、聚合物种到纳米簇）一直是进一步探索PDH反应的障碍。
2. 催化剂的稳定性很大程度上取决于其活性金属成分在支撑表面的结构特性。
3. 比如，CoOx/Al2O3催化剂表面的大Co3O4颗粒很容易转化为金属Co粒子，促进丙烷裂解反应。
4. 然而，当CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta支持的硅醇中时，在PDH反应过程中现场形成的微小金属Co可以作为脱氢活性位点。
5. 利用多种高级表征技术，包括TEM、XPS、H2-TPR、H2脉冲化学吸附、原位傅里叶变换红外光谱和拉曼光谱等，对合成的催化剂进行深入分析以了解其物理和化学性质。
6. 进一步研究了丙烷在双金属位点上的潜在反应途径，以更全面地理解新型NiZn-S-1催化剂的稳定性。
