1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pathways for reactants and products. This allows for more efficient and faster reactions. The main types of these materials include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized through various methods such as the templating technique, sol-gel process, and polymerization method. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by increasing the reaction rate and yield, reducing coke formation, and enhancing stability. They achieve this by facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products and providing more active sites for the reaction.

2. The intensities of diffraction peaks are slightly strengthened for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1 samples, possibly due to single metal cations accelerating the induction of nucleation and crystallization of zeolites during in situ synthesis. This indicates that single metal cations can promote the growth and formation of zeolite structures.

3. For the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, the formation of bulk Ni nanoclusters is implied, as the band associated with the tetrahedral Ni2+ species cannot be detected. This suggests that Ni species are not anchored into the framework of S-1 zeolite in the same manner as Zn species.

<p>For comparison, monometallic Ni-S-1 and Zn-S-1 catalysts are also synthesized under similar processes.</p>

<p>The intensities of bands at 3740 and 3520 cm1 are weakened slightly on the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1, while the intensities of bands at 3725 and 3690 cm1 are weakened apparently.</p>
<p>When the Ni and/or Zn species are introduced during in situ synthesis, however, the band ascribed to T-O-T shifts towards high frequency, changing in the about 25 cm1 for the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 and 43 cm1 for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1.</p>
<p>A new Raman band at 471 cm1 emerges, implying the formation of monometallic Niδ+ sites (Ni-O-Si species).</p>
<p>Notably, the intensity of the band at 1452 cm1 is weakened partially, implying that most of Ni and Zn species act as weak Lewis acid sites.</p>
<p>The band at 2960 cm1 associated with the asymmetric stretching vibration of CH bond of CH3 groups in the propane is weakened apparently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two new bands at 2930 and 2860 cm1 assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration and symmetrical stretching vibration of CH bond of CH2 groups can be observed.</p>
<p>The intensities of other bands (2960, 2930, 2860 and 1460 cm1) are obvious stronger on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the color of 0.2Ni-S-1 sample becomes black, suggesting the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as coke precursors derived from excessive hydrogenolysis and eventually leading to the generation of carbon deposition.</p>
<p>This may be because the Znδ+ sites can contribute more electrons to Niδ+ sites, reducing the hydrogenolysis of alkyl intermediates, boosting the propylene desorption, which is consistent with C3H6-TPD results.</p>
<p>Comprehensive comparison, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) shows excellent catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with relatively lower deactivation rate (about 0.0778 h1) and great C3H6 selectivity (>90 %) after 30 h on stream.</p>
<p>Multiple characterizations further reveal that the enhancement of PDH performance ought to be attributed to the synergistic effect between bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, which is beneficial for the selective activation of CH bond and propylene desorption to reduce the formation of coke species with high graphitization degree, improving the catalyst stability.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating pathways that allow for the easy diffusion of reactants and products. This is achieved through the strategic arrangement of pore sizes within the zeolite framework. The micropores provide sites for the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, while the mesopores/macropores facilitate their transport and the release of products. This hierarchical structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by optimizing the balance between adsorption and diffusion rates.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous, macroporous, and hierarchical zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites have pore diameters ranging from 2 to 50 nm, while macroporous zeolites have larger pore sizes, typically greater than 50 nm. Hierarchical zeolites are designed to have both micropores and mesopores/macropores in the same material. These materials can be synthesized using methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and ion-exchange methods. By controlling the synthesis parameters, it is possible to tailor the pore size distribution and shape of the zeolites to optimize their catalytic properties for PDH reactions.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions in several ways. They offer enhanced accessibility for reactants and intermediates due to the combined effects of micropores and mesopores/macropores. This leads to faster diffusion rates and more efficient utilization of active sites. Additionally, the hierarchical structure can reduce the risk of sintering and aggregation of active sites, which is a common issue in zeolite-based catalysts. Furthermore, the tailored pore size distribution allows for better control over the adsorption/desorption processes, which can lead to improved selectivity and stability. Overall, the strategic design and synthesis of hierarchical zeolites enable them to outperform traditional zeolites in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more channels for reactants and products to move through. They can be synthesized using various methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, and ion-exchange techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions by facilitating faster diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the risk of particle agglomeration, and enhancing the selectivity of propylene production.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous, macroporous, and bifunctional zeolites. Synthesis methods typically involve template-directed assembly, surfactant-assisted synthesis, and post-synthesis modification. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by offering better thermal stability, reduced coke formation, and improved selectivity for propylene production.

3. The performance of PDH reactions is improved by hierarchical zeolites due to their optimized pore size distribution, enhanced surface area, and improved access to active sites. This leads to increased efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and lower emissions compared to conventional zeolites.

4. Non-oxidative PDH is gaining attention due to its potential for utilizing abundant shale and natural gas resources efficiently. Representative catalysts for PDH include PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3, which have been commercialized in processes like Oleflex and Catofin. However, these catalysts face challenges such as high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation. Hierarchical zeolites address these issues by providing more stable and selective active sites for the PDH reaction.

5. The stability of catalysts in PDH reactions is closely tied to the structural properties of metal active phases on the support. For instance, confining metal species within zeolite frameworks can lead to the formation of ultrasmall metallic particles that are more stable during PDH reactions. On the other hand, large crystallites of metals can be easily reduced, affecting the catalytic activity.

6. The Ni-Zn sites in the bimetallic catalysts are anchored in the siliceous zeolite framework, which contributes to their stability at high temperatures. The presence of Zn enhances the electronic density of Ni sites, facilitating propylene desorption and reducing coke formation. This synergy leads to improved performance and stability of the catalyst.

7. The regeneration performance of the catalyst is high after multiple oxidation-reduction cycles, indicating its robustness and sustainability in industrial applications. This is particularly advantageous for PDH processes, which require frequent catalyst regeneration to maintain optimal performance.
