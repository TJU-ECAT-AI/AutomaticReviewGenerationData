<p>However, the above phenomenon cannot be found on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, and the intensities of all peaks are weakened on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, which may be caused by the difference in the chemical speciations of bimetallic Ni-Zn species in the S-1.</p>
<p>Notably, the intensities of diffraction peaks are slightly strengthened for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1 samples, possibly due to single metal cations accelerating the induction of nucleation and crystallization of zeolites during in situ synthesis [32] ,[37] ,[39] .</p>
<p>For the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, the absorption bands at 247 and 336 nm assigned to the tetrahedral Zn2+ species can be seen, but the band associated with the tetrahedral Ni2+ species cannot be detected, implying the formation of bulk Ni nanoclusters, which is in line with the TEM observations.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pathways for reactants and products. This allows for more efficient and faster reactions. The main types of these materials include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized through various methods such as the templating technique, sol-gel process, and polymerization method. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by increasing the reaction rate and yield, reducing coke formation, and enhancing stability. They achieve this by facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products and providing more active sites for the reaction.

2. The intensities of diffraction peaks are slightly strengthened for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1 samples, possibly due to single metal cations accelerating the induction of nucleation and crystallization of zeolites during in situ synthesis. This indicates that single metal cations can promote the growth and formation of zeolite structures.

3. For the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, the formation of bulk Ni nanoclusters is implied, as the band associated with the tetrahedral Ni2+ species cannot be detected. This suggests that Ni species are not anchored into the framework of S-1 zeolite in the same manner as Zn species.

1. 分级沸石通过提供更大的表面积和更易于访问的反应路径，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可接近性。这允许更高效的反应和更快的反应速率。这些材料的主要类型包括介孔和大孔沸石，通过各种方法合成，如模板技术、溶胶-凝胶过程和聚合方法。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提高反应速率和产率、减少焦炭形成和增强稳定性来改善PDH反应性能。它们通过促进反应物和产物的更好扩散和提供更多活性位点实现这一目标。

2. 对于0.2Ni-S-1和0.2Zn-S-1样品，衍射峰的强度可能由于单金属离子在原位合成过程中加速了多孔结构的诱导和结晶而略微增强。这表明单金属离子可以促进沸石结构的生长和形成。

3. 对于0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1，推测Ni物种形成了大块纳米簇，因为与四面体Ni2+物种相关的带无法被检测到。这表明Ni物种并未像Zn物种那样锚定在S-1沸石骨架中。
