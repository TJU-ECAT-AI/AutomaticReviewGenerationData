<p>For comparison, monometallic Ni-S-1 and Zn-S-1 catalysts are also synthesized under similar processes.</p>
<p>Notably, the intensities of diffraction peaks are slightly strengthened for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1 samples, possibly due to single metal cations accelerating the induction of nucleation and crystallization of zeolites during in situ synthesis.</p>
<p>However, the above phenomenon cannot be found on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, and the intensities of all peaks are weakened on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, which may be caused by the difference in the chemical speciations of bimetallic Ni-Zn species in the S-1.</p>
<p>The intensities of bands at 3740 and 3520 cm1 are weakened slightly on the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1, while the intensities of bands at 3725 and 3690 cm1 are weakened apparently.</p>
<p>When the Ni and/or Zn species are introduced during in situ synthesis, however, the band ascribed to T-O-T shifts towards high frequency, changing in the about 25 cm1 for the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 and 43 cm1 for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1.</p>
<p>A new Raman band at 471 cm1 emerges, implying the formation of monometallic Niδ+ sites (Ni-O-Si species).</p>
<p>Notably, the intensity of the band at 1452 cm1 is weakened partially, implying that most of Ni and Zn species act as weak Lewis acid sites.</p>
<p>The band at 2960 cm1 associated with the asymmetric stretching vibration of CH bond of CH3 groups in the propane is weakened apparently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two new bands at 2930 and 2860 cm1 assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration and symmetrical stretching vibration of CH bond of CH2 groups can be observed.</p>
<p>The intensities of other bands (2960, 2930, 2860 and 1460 cm1) are obvious stronger on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the color of 0.2Ni-S-1 sample becomes black, suggesting the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as coke precursors derived from excessive hydrogenolysis and eventually leading to the generation of carbon deposition.</p>
<p>This may be because the Znδ+ sites can contribute more electrons to Niδ+ sites, reducing the hydrogenolysis of alkyl intermediates, boosting the propylene desorption, which is consistent with C3H6-TPD results.</p>
<p>Comprehensive comparison, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) shows excellent catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with relatively lower deactivation rate (about 0.0778 h1) and great C3H6 selectivity (>90 %) after 30 h on stream.</p>
<p>Multiple characterizations further reveal that the enhancement of PDH performance ought to be attributed to the synergistic effect between bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, which is beneficial for the selective activation of CH bond and propylene desorption to reduce the formation of coke species with high graphitization degree, improving the catalyst stability.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating pathways that allow for the easy diffusion of reactants and products. This is achieved through the strategic arrangement of pore sizes within the zeolite framework. The micropores provide sites for the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, while the mesopores/macropores facilitate their transport and the release of products. This hierarchical structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by optimizing the balance between adsorption and diffusion rates.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous, macroporous, and hierarchical zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites have pore diameters ranging from 2 to 50 nm, while macroporous zeolites have larger pore sizes, typically greater than 50 nm. Hierarchical zeolites are designed to have both micropores and mesopores/macropores in the same material. These materials can be synthesized using methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and ion-exchange methods. By controlling the synthesis parameters, it is possible to tailor the pore size distribution and shape of the zeolites to optimize their catalytic properties for PDH reactions.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions in several ways. They offer enhanced accessibility for reactants and intermediates due to the combined effects of micropores and mesopores/macropores. This leads to faster diffusion rates and more efficient utilization of active sites. Additionally, the hierarchical structure can reduce the risk of sintering and aggregation of active sites, which is a common issue in zeolite-based catalysts. Furthermore, the tailored pore size distribution allows for better control over the adsorption/desorption processes, which can lead to improved selectivity and stability. Overall, the strategic design and synthesis of hierarchical zeolites enable them to outperform traditional zeolites in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions.

1. 分级沸石通过在分子筛框架中战略性排列孔隙大小，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而提高PDH反应的通达性。微孔提供吸附反应物和中间体的场所，而介孔/大孔则促进它们的传输和产物的释放。这种层级结构通过优化吸附和扩散速率之间的平衡，相对于传统沸石提高了PDH反应的性能。

2. 分级沸石的主要类型包括介孔、大孔和层级沸石。介孔沸石的孔径范围为2到50纳米，而大孔沸石具有更大的孔径，通常大于50纳米。层级沸石设计有微孔和介孔/大孔在同一材料中。这些材料可以通过模板导向合成、溶胶-凝胶过程和离子交换方法进行合成。通过控制合成参数，可以定制沸石的孔径分布和形状，以优化其PDH反应的催化性质。

3. 相比于传统沸石，层级沸石在几个方面提高了PDH反应的性能。它们由于微孔和介孔/大孔的综合效应提供了增强的通达性，这导致更快的扩散率和活性位点更高效的利用。此外，层级结构可以减少活性位点的聚集和烧结风险，这是传统沸石催化剂的常见问题。此外，定制的孔径分布允许更好地控制吸附/脱附过程，这可能导致更好的选择性和稳定性。总体而言，层级沸石的策略设计和合成使它们能够超越传统沸石，在PDH反应中表现出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。
