[1] "Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] ."
[2] "Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] ."
[3] "In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."
[4] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases [4] ,[5] ."
[5] "Currently, two representative of PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts have been commercially applied in the PDH process [1] ,[7] ,[8] ."
[6] "Through analysis in-depth, the catalytic stabilities of catalysts strongly rely on the structural properties of metal active phases on the supports."
[7] "However, if the CoOx species are confined into the silanols of SiBeta support, the ultrasmall metallic Co formed in situ during the PDH reaction can become dehydrogenation active sites [11] ."
[8] "For instance, large Co3O4 crystallites formed over the CoOx/Al2O3 are easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of propane cracking reactions [17] ."
[9] "Meanwhile, it also does not observe small bright spots associated with Ni-Zn nanoclusters in the HAADF-STEM image, only the appearance of large bright region, spreading all over the zeolite (cf.Fig. 2 c)."
[10] "This is consistent with the second explanation of change in the pore structure."
[11] "However, the Ni-Zn nanoclusters with 5  7 nm can be found on the external surface of 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 zeolite (cf.Fig. 2 d, e and f)."
[12] "It is confirmed that the stability of bimetallic Ni-Zn sites can be enhanced significantly due to the anchoring role of Si-OH groups during the synthesis of zeolite sample (cf.Fig. 4 A)."
[13] "In combination with XPS spectra, this may be because the Znδ+ sites can contribute more electrons to Niδ+ sites, reducing the hydrogenolysis of alkyl intermediates, boosting the propylene desorption, which is consistent with C3H6-TPD results."
[14] "Particularly, this catalyst exhibits high regeneration performance after 4 successive oxidationreduction cycles."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more channels for reactants and products to move through. They can be synthesized using various methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, and ion-exchange techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions by facilitating faster diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the risk of particle agglomeration, and enhancing the selectivity of propylene production.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous, macroporous, and bifunctional zeolites. Synthesis methods typically involve template-directed assembly, surfactant-assisted synthesis, and post-synthesis modification. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by offering better thermal stability, reduced coke formation, and improved selectivity for propylene production.

3. The performance of PDH reactions is improved by hierarchical zeolites due to their optimized pore size distribution, enhanced surface area, and improved access to active sites. This leads to increased efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and lower emissions compared to conventional zeolites.

4. Non-oxidative PDH is gaining attention due to its potential for utilizing abundant shale and natural gas resources efficiently. Representative catalysts for PDH include PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3, which have been commercialized in processes like Oleflex and Catofin. However, these catalysts face challenges such as high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation. Hierarchical zeolites address these issues by providing more stable and selective active sites for the PDH reaction.

5. The stability of catalysts in PDH reactions is closely tied to the structural properties of metal active phases on the support. For instance, confining metal species within zeolite frameworks can lead to the formation of ultrasmall metallic particles that are more stable during PDH reactions. On the other hand, large crystallites of metals can be easily reduced, affecting the catalytic activity.

6. The Ni-Zn sites in the bimetallic catalysts are anchored in the siliceous zeolite framework, which contributes to their stability at high temperatures. The presence of Zn enhances the electronic density of Ni sites, facilitating propylene desorption and reducing coke formation. This synergy leads to improved performance and stability of the catalyst.

7. The regeneration performance of the catalyst is high after multiple oxidation-reduction cycles, indicating its robustness and sustainability in industrial applications. This is particularly advantageous for PDH processes, which require frequent catalyst regeneration to maintain optimal performance.

5. 在PDH反应中，催化剂的稳定性紧密依赖于支持物上金属活性相的结构特性。例如，在沸石骨架内限制金属物种可以导致形成更稳定的超小金属颗粒。另一方面，较大的金属晶粒容易被还原，影响催化活性。

6. 催化剂中的Ni-Zn位点被锚定在硅酸盐框架中，这有助于其在高温下的稳定性。Zn的存在增强了Ni位点的电子密度，促进了丙烯脱附并减少了焦炭生成。这种协同作用导致了催化剂性能和稳定性的提高。
