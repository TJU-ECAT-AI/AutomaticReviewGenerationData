<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a prospective benign process for the production of propylene, but generally depends on high-price Pt and toxic Cr(VI) catalysts that often suffer from the rapid deactivation derived from metal sintering and severe coke deposition.</p>
<p>To overcome these problems, the breakthroughs in an alternative catalyst design with efficient, low-cost and eco-friendly play a crucial role in successfully developing this process.</p>
<p>We facilely fabricate the bimetallic-sites catalyst of Ni-Zn anchored in the zeolite framework of silicalite-1 (depicted as NiZn-S-1) by ligand-protected method, which performs high temperature stability and anti-sintering.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to enter and exit the zeolite structure. This increases the surface area available for reactions, allowing for more efficient utilization of the catalyst. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and those with a combination of micropores, mesopores, and macropores. Synthesis methods often involve template-directed synthesis, where a molecular or organic template is used to control the pore size and structure during the zeolite growth process. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by enhancing the diffusion rates of reactants and products, reducing the risk of coke deposition, and maintaining high activity over multiple cycles.

2. The synthesis of the bimetallic-sites catalyst of Ni-Zn anchored in the zeolite framework of silicalite-1 is achieved through a ligand-protected method. This method involves the use of ligands to stabilize the metal ions during synthesis, ensuring they are incorporated into the zeolite framework rather than forming larger aggregates. The Ni-Zn-S-1 catalyst is characterized by high stability and activity, with a high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1, which is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance.

3. The 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst, with a high Ni/Zn molar ratio, demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity in PDH reactions, with an initial propane conversion of 32.5%, a TOFpropane of 28.5 min−1, and a low deactivation rate of about 0.0778 h−1. This catalyst maintains high performance after 30 hours of operation, showcasing its stability and efficiency in producing propylene.

4. The synergistic effect between bimetallic Ni-Zn sites is the key factor responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance of the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst. This effect promotes selective activation of CH bonds and facilitates propylene desorption, reducing the formation of coke species with high graphitization degree. As a result, the catalyst exhibits improved stability and reduced coke deposition, which are critical factors for the successful commercialization of PDH processes.

5. The design of novel bimetallic-sites catalysts, such as the Ni-Zn-S-1 catalyst, offers a promising avenue for the development of efficient PDH catalysts that are both low-cost and environmentally friendly. By combining the benefits of bimetallic sites with the structure of hierarchical zeolites, these catalysts can potentially overcome the limitations of traditional Pt and Cr(VI)-based catalysts, leading to more sustainable and economically viable PDH processes.
