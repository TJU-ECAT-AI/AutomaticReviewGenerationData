<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas.</p>
<p>For various reasons, CrOx-Al2O3 based catalysts have been commercially utilized in Catofin process.</p>
<p>Zeolites, possessing high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability and tunable acidity, can be used as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>De Moor et al. and Tranca et al. have reported that the adsorption of propane in HZSM-5 zeolite was exothermic, where the adsorption of propane on Brnsted acid sites was much easier than propane adsorbed in the channels of HZSM-5 zeolite.</p>
<p>The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>The adsorption of propane in HZSM-5 zeolite was exothermic, where the adsorption of propane on Brnsted acid sites was much easier than propane adsorbed in the channels of HZSM-5 zeolite.</p>
<p>During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature would result in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity, high dispersion, suitable amount of acidic sites and strong metal-support interactions, which exhibit high activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Characterization results, PDH tests and Na+ doping experiments demonstrate that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites (originating from Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites) are responsible for the high catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.</p>

To enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores. These materials typically include materials like mesoporous silica, mesoporous alumina, and mesoporous titania, often synthesized through methods such as template-directed synthesis or sol-gel processing. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by providing a larger surface area and more defined pore size distribution, which enhances the accessibility of reactants and products. This results in better catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions.
