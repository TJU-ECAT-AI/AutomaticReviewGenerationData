<p>It was reported that the low-coordinated Cr3+ species were the active sites for PDH, but they tended to aggregate, leading to low activity and regenerability.</p>
<p>For instance, Cr species supported on ZrO2 were observed to deactivate faster than Cr/Al2O3 in PDH due to the presence of weak metal-support interactions between Cr species and ZrO2.</p>
<p>The low amount of acidic sites in HZSM-5 zeolite support can significantly affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, and thus, affecting the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH.</p>
<p>The presence of strong interactions between metal and nanocarbon supports exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation.</p>
<p>The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability.</p>
