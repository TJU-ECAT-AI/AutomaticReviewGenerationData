CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 (Cr/Z-5(260) is synthesized by a simple wet impregnation method, which exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH. 

At a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.59 h1, a propylene formation rate of 4.1 mmol gcat1 h1 ( 32.6% propane conversion and  94.2% propylene selectivity) can be maintained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream, which is much better than commercial Cr/Al2O3 (Catofin process, catalyst life is several hours) at the same reaction conditions.

With increasing the WHSV to 5.9 h1, a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol gcat1 h1 can be obtained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream, demonstrating a very promising PDH catalyst.

Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation. 

Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability.

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a unique environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species. These materials, such as high-silica HZSM-5 with a specific SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by offering high surface area and well-defined channels. The synthesis method involves a simple wet impregnation process. The hierarchical structure allows for better control over the dispersion of Cr species, enhancing their activity and stability in PDH reactions.

The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species. This leads to high catalytic activity and stability in PDH reactions. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite play a crucial role in propane adsorption and activation, contributing to the high catalytic performance of the Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst system.

By optimizing the preparation conditions, a 5 wt% Cr supported on HZSM-5(260) catalyst can achieve the best performance, with a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol gcat1 h1 after 50 h time-on-stream at a high WHSV of 5.9 h1.

层次型沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，为PDH反应提供了增强的可接近性，通过提供Cr物种分散和稳定性的独特环境。这些材料，如具有特定SiO2/Al2O3比率的高硅含量HZSM-5，与传统沸石相比，通过提供高比表面积和定义明确的通道改善了PDH反应性能。合成方法涉及简单的浸渍过程。层次结构允许更好地控制Cr物种的分散，从而增强了它们在PDH反应中的活性和稳定性。

HZSM-5沸石的高比表面积和定义明确的孔隙提供了一个特殊的环境来分散和稳定Cr物种。这导致了PDH反应中Cr/Z-5(260)催化剂系统的高催化活性和稳定性。HZSM-5沸石上的Brnsted酸位对丙烷吸附和激活起着关键作用，促进了高催化性能。

通过优化制备条件，可以在HZSM-5(260)上支持5 wt% Cr的催化剂实现最佳性能，在高WHSV（5.9 h1）下经过50小时操作后，可以获得27.9 mmol gcat1 h1的高丙烯形成率。

To enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores. These materials typically include materials like mesoporous silica, mesoporous alumina, and mesoporous titania, often synthesized through methods such as template-directed synthesis or sol-gel processing. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by providing a larger surface area and more defined pore size distribution, which enhances the accessibility of reactants and products. This results in better catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions.
