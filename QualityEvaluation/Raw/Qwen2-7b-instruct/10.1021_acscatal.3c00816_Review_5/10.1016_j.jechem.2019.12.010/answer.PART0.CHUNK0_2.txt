High-silica HZSM-5 zeolite combined with CrOx creates a material that enhances accessibility for PDH reactions. The hierarchical structure of the zeolite combines micropores and mesopores/macropores to facilitate better reactant and product transport. The synthesis method involves a wet impregnation process, which results in a catalyst with high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Characterization results, PDH tests and Na+ doping experiments demonstrate that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites (originating from Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites) are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The characterization studies, PDH tests, and sodium doping experiments confirm that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, which originate from both Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites, are the key factors contributing to the high catalytic performance. Specifically, the Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) within HZSM-5(260) play a pivotal role in propane adsorption and activation, thereby influencing the catalytic efficiency of the system.
