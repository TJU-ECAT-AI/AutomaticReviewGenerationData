CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 (Cr/Z-5(260) is synthesized by a simple wet impregnation method, which exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH. At a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.59 h1, a propylene formation rate of 4.1 mmol gcat1 h1 (32.6% propane conversion and 94.2% propylene selectivity) can be maintained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream, which is much better than commercial Cr/Al2O3 (Catofin process, catalyst life is several hours) at the same reaction conditions. With increasing the WHSV to 5.9 h1, a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol gcat1 h1 can be obtained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream, demonstrating a very promising PDH catalyst. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation. Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability.

The hierarchical zeolite HZSM-5 combines micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 is synthesized through a simple wet impregnation method. This material is characterized by its large surface area and well-defined channels, which provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species. The Cr species, combined with Brnsted acid sites in the HZSM-5 zeolite, are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites increase propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of the HZSM-5 zeolite contribute to the high catalytic activity and stability of the Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst.
