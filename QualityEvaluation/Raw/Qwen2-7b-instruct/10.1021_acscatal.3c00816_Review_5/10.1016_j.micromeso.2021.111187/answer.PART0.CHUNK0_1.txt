• "Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction."
• "The catalysts reduced at 650700 C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst."
• "A higher prereduction temperature of 750800 C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition."
• "Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption and coke formation for the Cocatalyzed PDH reactions."

Hierarchical zeolites, such as MCM-41, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by confining and organizing the active metal species, like cobalt (Co), within their nanostructured framework. This allows for optimized interactions between the metal species and the reactants, leading to increased reaction rates and selectivity. The synthesis methods typically involve template-directed assembly processes to create the ordered pore structure. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical materials often exhibit superior performance due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and improved stability against coke formation during PDH reactions. The use of hydrogen pre-reduction helps tune the interaction between Co species and the silica support, influencing the catalyst's ability to activate propane, desorb propylene efficiently, and minimize coke deposition.

层状沸石，如MCM-41，通过在其纳米结构框架内组织和定位活性金属物种（如钴（Co）），结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的可接近性。这允许优化金属物种与反应物之间的相互作用，导致增加的反应速率和选择性。合成方法通常涉及模板导向组装过程来创建有序的孔隙结构。与传统沸石相比，这些层次材料往往表现出更优性能，由于其增强的比表面积、孔径大小分布控制和PDH反应期间稳定性提高。氢预还原有助于调整Co物种与硅酸盐支持之间的相互作用，影响催化剂激活丙烷、高效脱除丙烯以及减少焦炭沉积的能力。
