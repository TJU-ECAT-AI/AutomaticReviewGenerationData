1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by allowing more efficient distribution of reactants and products within the zeolite structure. This results in improved contact between the active sites and the reactants, leading to enhanced reaction kinetics and selectivity. Main types of these materials include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), ordered mesoporous organosilicas (OMOs), and mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). Synthesis methods typically involve sol-gel processes, template-directed synthesis, and post-synthetic modification. These materials improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their tailored pore structures, which optimize the diffusion pathways and enhance the catalytic activity and stability.

2. The main effect of hydrogen prereduction on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation involves the multistage migration of framework Co2+ ions into extraframework Co0 species. This process occurs through different stages, with the catalysts reduced at temperatures ranging from 650 to 700 degrees Celsius resulting in a combination of framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined within the MCM41 channels. This configuration leads to an increase in the reaction rates during selective PDH reactions by 23 times compared to unreduced catalysts. In contrast, higher prereduction temperatures (750 to 800 degrees Celsius) cause the formation of larger Co particles, which are responsible for a significant decline in reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. The tuning of the interaction between Co species and the silica support by hydrogen prereduction optimizes the performance of propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions.

1. 分级沸石通过将微孔和介孔/大孔结合，增强了PDH反应的可接近性，通过优化活性位点与反应物之间的接触，从而提高反应动力学和选择性。主要类型包括金属有机框架（MOFs）、有序介孔有机硅（OMOs）和混合膜（MMMs）。合成方法通常涉及溶胶-凝胶过程、模板导向合成和后合成修饰。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过优化扩散路径和增强催化活性和稳定性来改善PDH反应。

2. 氢气预还原对Co@MCM-41催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的影响主要体现在框架Co2+离子向额外框架Co0物种的多阶段迁移过程中。此过程在不同阶段发生，温度从650至700度时的催化剂由框架Co2+离子和小尺寸Co0纳米簇组成，并且这些簇被限制在MCM41通道内。这种配置导致选择性PDH反应的反应速率提高了23倍，与未预还原的催化剂相比。相反，更高预还原温度（750至800度）导致形成较大的Co颗粒，这导致反应速率、丙烯选择性和严重的焦炭沉积显著下降。通过氢气预还原调整Co物种与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用，优化了丙烷激活、丙烯脱附和焦炭形成在Co催化PDH反应中的性能。

Hierarchical zeolites, such as MCM-41, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by confining and organizing the active metal species, like cobalt (Co), within their nanostructured framework. This allows for optimized interactions between the metal species and the reactants, leading to increased reaction rates and selectivity. The synthesis methods typically involve template-directed assembly processes to create the ordered pore structure. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical materials often exhibit superior performance due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and improved stability against coke formation during PDH reactions. The use of hydrogen pre-reduction helps tune the interaction between Co species and the silica support, influencing the catalyst's ability to activate propane, desorb propylene efficiently, and minimize coke deposition.

The research examines how hydrogen pre-reduction impacts the catalytic activity of Co@MCM-41 in propane dehydrogenation. It reveals that during pre-reduction, framework Co2+ ions undergo multi-stage migration to form extraframework Co0 species. Catalysts treated at temperatures ranging from 650 to 700 degrees Celsius exhibit a mixture of framework Co2+ ions and small Co0 clusters within the MCM41 channels, leading to a 23-fold increase in reaction rates compared to untreated catalysts in selective propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 750-800 degrees Celsius results in the formation of larger Co particles, which significantly reduces reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and increases coke formation. The study demonstrates that hydrogen pre-reduction modulates the interaction between Co species and the silica support, influencing the catalyst's performance in propane activation, propylene production, and coke deposition.

The hierarchical zeolites, specifically Co@MCM-41, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a highly porous structure that allows for efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. The main types of these materials are zeolites, which are known for their crystalline pore structures. Zeolites are synthesized through various methods, including hydrothermal synthesis, which involves the precipitation of zeolite crystals under controlled conditions, and ion-exchange techniques, where functional groups are introduced to modify the zeolite's properties. Compared to traditional zeolites, Co@MCM-41 catalysts exhibit improved performance in PDH reactions due to the specific interactions between cobalt species and silica support, optimized through hydrogen pre-reduction treatments. This process tunes the catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and coke formation, leading to enhanced efficiency and product yield in propane dehydrogenation.

The study examines how hydrogen pre-reduction impacts the performance of cobalt catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It reveals that multi-stage migration of framework cobalt(II) ions (Co2+) into extraframework cobalt(0) species occurs during pre-reduction. Catalysts subjected to pre-reduction at temperatures ranging from 650 to 700 degrees Celsius consist of both Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters within the MCM41 channels. These pre-reduced catalysts exhibit 23 times higher selective PDH reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts. Increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 750 to 800 degrees Celsius leads to the formation of larger cobalt particles, which result in significantly reduced reaction rates, decreased propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. The study also indicates that hydrogen pre-reduction modifies the interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, affecting propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in the cobalt-catalyzed PDH reactions.
