1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by allowing more efficient distribution of reactants and products within the zeolite structure. This results in improved contact between the active sites and the reactants, leading to enhanced reaction kinetics and selectivity. Main types of these materials include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), ordered mesoporous organosilicas (OMOs), and mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). Synthesis methods typically involve sol-gel processes, template-directed synthesis, and post-synthetic modification. These materials improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their tailored pore structures, which optimize the diffusion pathways and enhance the catalytic activity and stability.

2. The main effect of hydrogen prereduction on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation involves the multistage migration of framework Co2+ ions into extraframework Co0 species. This process occurs through different stages, with the catalysts reduced at temperatures ranging from 650 to 700 degrees Celsius resulting in a combination of framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined within the MCM41 channels. This configuration leads to an increase in the reaction rates during selective PDH reactions by 23 times compared to unreduced catalysts. In contrast, higher prereduction temperatures (750 to 800 degrees Celsius) cause the formation of larger Co particles, which are responsible for a significant decline in reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. The tuning of the interaction between Co species and the silica support by hydrogen prereduction optimizes the performance of propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions.

1. 分级沸石通过将微孔和介孔/大孔结合，增强了PDH反应的可接近性，通过优化活性位点与反应物之间的接触，从而提高反应动力学和选择性。主要类型包括金属有机框架（MOFs）、有序介孔有机硅（OMOs）和混合膜（MMMs）。合成方法通常涉及溶胶-凝胶过程、模板导向合成和后合成修饰。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过优化扩散路径和增强催化活性和稳定性来改善PDH反应。

2. 氢气预还原对Co@MCM-41催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的影响主要体现在框架Co2+离子向额外框架Co0物种的多阶段迁移过程中。此过程在不同阶段发生，温度从650至700度时的催化剂由框架Co2+离子和小尺寸Co0纳米簇组成，并且这些簇被限制在MCM41通道内。这种配置导致选择性PDH反应的反应速率提高了23倍，与未预还原的催化剂相比。相反，更高预还原温度（750至800度）导致形成较大的Co颗粒，这导致反应速率、丙烯选择性和严重的焦炭沉积显著下降。通过氢气预还原调整Co物种与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用，优化了丙烷激活、丙烯脱附和焦炭形成在Co催化PDH反应中的性能。
