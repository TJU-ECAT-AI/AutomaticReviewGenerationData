The research examines how hydrogen pre-reduction impacts the catalytic activity of Co@MCM-41 in propane dehydrogenation. It reveals that during pre-reduction, framework Co2+ ions undergo multi-stage migration to form extraframework Co0 species. Catalysts treated at temperatures ranging from 650 to 700 degrees Celsius exhibit a mixture of framework Co2+ ions and small Co0 clusters within the MCM41 channels, leading to a 23-fold increase in reaction rates compared to untreated catalysts in selective propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 750-800 degrees Celsius results in the formation of larger Co particles, which significantly reduces reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and increases coke formation. The study demonstrates that hydrogen pre-reduction modulates the interaction between Co species and the silica support, influencing the catalyst's performance in propane activation, propylene production, and coke deposition.

研究探讨了氢预还原对Co@MCM-41在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化活性的影响。研究表明，在预还原过程中，框架中的Co2+离子会经历多阶段迁移形成额外框架的Co0物种。在650到700摄氏度之间进行预处理的催化剂包含框架Co2+离子和MCM41通道内的小型Co0簇，与未处理的催化剂相比，其在选择性丙烷脱氢反应中的反应速率提高了23倍。然而，将预处理温度提高到750-800摄氏度会导致形成较大的Co颗粒，这显著降低了反应速率、丙烯选择性和加剧了焦炭沉积。研究显示，氢预还原调节了Co物种与二氧化硅支持物之间的相互作用，影响了催化剂在丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和焦炭形成的性能。
