The study examines how hydrogen pre-reduction impacts the performance of cobalt catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It reveals that multi-stage migration of framework cobalt(II) ions (Co2+) into extraframework cobalt(0) species occurs during pre-reduction. Catalysts subjected to pre-reduction at temperatures ranging from 650 to 700 degrees Celsius consist of both Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters within the MCM41 channels. These pre-reduced catalysts exhibit 23 times higher selective PDH reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts. Increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 750 to 800 degrees Celsius leads to the formation of larger cobalt particles, which result in significantly reduced reaction rates, decreased propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. The study also indicates that hydrogen pre-reduction modifies the interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, affecting propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in the cobalt-catalyzed PDH reactions.

研究探讨了氢预还原对钴催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的性能的影响。发现框架钴(II)离子（Co2+）在预还原过程中可以多阶段迁移到额外的Co0物种中。在650到700摄氏度之间进行预还原的催化剂由框架Co2+离子和MCM41通道内的小型Co0纳米簇组成，显示出与未预还原催化剂相比，选择性PDH反应速率提高了23倍。将预热温度提高至750至800摄氏度会导致形成较大的钴颗粒，导致反应速率显著下降、丙烯选择性降低以及严重的焦炭沉积。研究表明，氢预还原调整了钴物种与二氧化硅支持物之间的相互作用，影响了丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和焦炭形成在钴催化PDH反应中的性能。
