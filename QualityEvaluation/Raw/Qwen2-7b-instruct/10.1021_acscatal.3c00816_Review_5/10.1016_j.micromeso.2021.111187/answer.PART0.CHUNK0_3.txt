• "Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction."
• "The catalysts reduced at 650-700°C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels."
• "A higher prereduction temperature of 750-800°C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition."
• "Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation for the Co-catalyzed PDH reactions."

The hierarchical zeolites, specifically Co@MCM-41, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a highly porous structure that allows for efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. The main types of these materials are zeolites, which are known for their crystalline pore structures. Zeolites are synthesized through various methods, including hydrothermal synthesis, which involves the precipitation of zeolite crystals under controlled conditions, and ion-exchange techniques, where functional groups are introduced to modify the zeolite's properties. Compared to traditional zeolites, Co@MCM-41 catalysts exhibit improved performance in PDH reactions due to the specific interactions between cobalt species and silica support, optimized through hydrogen pre-reduction treatments. This process tunes the catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and coke formation, leading to enhanced efficiency and product yield in propane dehydrogenation.

层级沸石，特别是Co@MCM-41，通过提供高度多孔结构来增强PDH反应的可接近性，该结构允许有效吸附和脱附反应物和产物。这些材料的主要类型是沸石，它们因其晶体孔结构而闻名。沸石通过各种方法合成，包括水热合成，即在控制条件下沉淀沸石晶体的方法，以及离子交换技术，其中引入功能基团以修改沸石的性质。与传统沸石相比，Co@MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出改进的性能，这是由于钴物种与硅酸盐支持物的特定相互作用，通过氢预还原处理优化。这个过程调节了催化活性、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成，从而提高了丙烷脱氢的效率和产品产率。
