        Hierarchical zeolites, integrating micropores and mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance the accessibility for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by optimizing pore structures and surface areas. These materials, including types like ZSM-5, MFI, MEL, BEA, MCM-41, SBA-15, and SBA-16, are synthesized through various methods such as hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-directed assembly. They improve PDH reaction performance by providing enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and stability, surpassing traditional zeolites. The presence of mesopores helps in stabilizing PtSn particles, accelerating diffusion rates, and preventing severe sintering at high temperatures. The introduction of metals like ZnOx, Co, and Ga forms active sites that facilitate the PDH reaction, demonstrating higher activity and selectivity compared to traditional catalysts. The use of hierarchical zeolites can lead to more efficient and durable catalysts for PDH reactions, offering a promising avenue for the chemical industry.

            Hierarchical zeolites, integrating micropores and mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance PDH reaction accessibility. These materials, including types like MFI, MEL, ZSM-5, and others, are synthesized through methods such as hydrothermal, sol-gel, and template-directed assembly. The inclusion of mesopores/macropores provides additional pathways for reactants and products, improving the efficiency of the catalytic process. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites exhibit superior performance in PDH reactions due to enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution, as highlighted by quotes [10.1021/jacs.2c02636] and [10.1021/acscatal.1c01808].

            The multi-scale pore structure of hierarchical zeolites also facilitates the accommodation of small metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within mesopores, which restrains their free migration and prevents severe sintering at high temperatures. This structure improves accessibility for PDH reactions, as elucidated by quote [10.1002/ange.202003349]. Future research might explore the design of small MNPs with controllable sizes through adjustments to hierarchical structures, offering a promising route for optimized catalysts, as suggested by quotes [10.1021/acscatal.1c05921] and [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3].
            
            Hierarchical zeolites also enable the development of green, nonprecious dehydrogenation catalysts, as demonstrated by the dealumination of AlBeta and subsequent impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, resulting in a catalyst that maintains high C3H6 yield over extended periods, as reported in [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037]. Additionally, the presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was confirmed, further highlighting the versatility of hierarchical zeolites in PDH reactions, as noted in [10.1039/D1SC05866E].

            The integration of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical zeolites offers a significant enhancement in PDH reaction accessibility, performance, and selectivity. This review section has delved into the detailed analysis of various studies, synthesizing a comprehensive understanding of hierarchical zeolites' role in PDH reactions. It emphasizes the types of hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, and the improvements they offer over traditional zeolites in PDH reactions, providing insights into the future directions of research in this field.

            The commercial PDH technologies currently utilize catalysts containing Cr or Pt, which suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the necessity for environmentally harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3]. Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550°C, showcasing the innovative use of materials in PDH catalysis [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3]. For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400 hours on a propane stream [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3].
            The combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical zeolites enhances accessibility for PDH reactions, as seen in the development of single-crystal house-of-cards-like ZSM-5 [10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b04970]. These materials can be synthesized using hydrothermal synthesis or template-directed assembly, offering improved pore structures and increased surface area, which surpasses traditional zeolites in PDH reaction performance [10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b04970].
            The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was confirmed by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations [10.1039/D1SC05866E]. Stability at 600°C remains uncertain, but the lower H+ concentration in reduced In-CHA samples compared to H-CHA suggests that In+ species rather than InHx were formed at 550°C [10.1039/D1SC05866E]. The experimentally determined ratio of formed water to consumed hydrogen during the entire process was 1.1, indicating that the main oxidized species was [InO]+, as supported by XRD that revealed no In2O3 diffraction peaks detected on H2-O2 treated In-CHA(11, 1.0) (Fig. S25) [10.1039/D1SC05866E]. In-CHA shows better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, with no significant decrease of the C3H6 yield over 14 hours (Fig. 9a) [10.1039/D1SC05866E].
            In summary, hierarchical zeolites, featuring their unique combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance the accessibility and efficiency of PDH reactions. These materials, characterized by their advanced synthesis methods and tailored pore structures, outperform traditional zeolites in terms of catalytic performance and stability. The integration of novel metallic species and the optimization of pore architectures provide a promising avenue for the development of highly selective and durable catalysts for PDH reactions.
