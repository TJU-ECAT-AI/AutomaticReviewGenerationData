        Hierarchical zeolites, particularly dealuminated β zeolites, enhance PDH reactions by integrating micropores and mesopores/macropores for improved accessibility. Key types include those synthesized through methods like template-directed assembly, enabling the creation of both small and larger pores. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites like dealuminated β zeolites show superior performance in PDH reactions due to their unique pore structure, serving as an ideal support for well-dispersed ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH.

        The dealuminated β zeolite, after removing aluminum atoms, results in a material with a large amount of small ZnO nanoclusters that act as active phases in PDH. This synthesis method allows for the reduction of side reactions, enhancing propylene selectivity. The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite contributes to better performance in PDH reactions. The dealuminated β zeolite also provides a positive environment for the dispersion and formation of small ZnO nanoclusters, which act as Lewis acid sites (LAS) for catalyzing PDH. These LAS, derived from the interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the zeolite framework, are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity.

        The dealuminated β zeolite, therefore, serves as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH.
