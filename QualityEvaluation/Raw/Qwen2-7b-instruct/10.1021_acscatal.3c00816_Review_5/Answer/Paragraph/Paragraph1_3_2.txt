            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acscatal.1c01497\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.2c05042\] and \[10.1021/acscatal.2c00928\]. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MEL, and BEA structures, synthesized via template-directed assembly or sol-gel processes. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution, as highlighted by studies (Quote 1 and Quote 2).

            The robust and efficient propane dehydrogenation catalysts from Fe-Silicalite-1 materials (Quote 3) and the synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites typically involve hydrothermal processes (Quote 4) are key points emphasized in the references \[10.1021/acscatal.2c05042\] and \[10.1021/acscatal.2c00928\].

            The main types of hierarchical zeolites include silicalite-1, chabazite, and mordenite (Quote 5), synthesized through hydrothermal treatment and template-directed assembly. These materials offer superior performance over traditional zeolites due to their unique pore structures (Quote 6), as discussed in \[10.1021/acscatal.2c00928\].
