The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite after removing Al atoms reduces side reactions, enhancing propylene selectivity. The dealuminated β zeolite as a support provides a positive environment for the dispersion and formation of small ZnO nanoclusters. Small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the zeolite framework act as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which are active for catalyzing PDH. These LAS, derived from the interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the zeolite framework, are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity. The dealuminated β zeolite, therefore, serves as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH. The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enables to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature. Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition. The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5. The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was confirmed by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, the stability of this compound at the reaction temperature of 600°C is still uncertain. The lower H+ concentration in reduced In-CHA samples compared with H-CHA is additional evidence showing that In+ species rather than InHx were formed at 550°C.

The potential for hierarchical zeolites to enable high-throughput screening and optimization of catalysts using computational methods and machine learning algorithms offers a promising direction for accelerating the discovery of novel PDH catalysts. Future studies should also aim to address the challenges associated with scaling up hierarchical zeolite-based catalysts for industrial application, focusing on aspects such as cost-effectiveness, durability, and compatibility with existing industrial processes. The combination of hierarchical zeolites with advanced characterization techniques, such as advanced imaging and spectroscopy, will facilitate a deeper understanding of the catalyst behavior under operational conditions, enabling the design of catalysts with improved performance and longevity.
