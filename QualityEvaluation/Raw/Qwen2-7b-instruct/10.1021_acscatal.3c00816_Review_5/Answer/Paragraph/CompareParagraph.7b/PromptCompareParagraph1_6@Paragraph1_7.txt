        Hierarchical zeolites, particularly dealuminated β zeolites, enhance PDH reactions by integrating micropores and mesopores/macropores for improved accessibility. Key types include those synthesized through methods like template-directed assembly, enabling the creation of both small and larger pores. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites like dealuminated β zeolites show superior performance in PDH reactions due to their unique pore structure, serving as an ideal support for well-dispersed ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH.

        The dealuminated β zeolite, after removing aluminum atoms, results in a material with a large amount of small ZnO nanoclusters that act as active phases in PDH. This synthesis method allows for the reduction of side reactions, enhancing propylene selectivity. The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite contributes to better performance in PDH reactions. The dealuminated β zeolite also provides a positive environment for the dispersion and formation of small ZnO nanoclusters, which act as Lewis acid sites (LAS) for catalyzing PDH. These LAS, derived from the interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the zeolite framework, are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity.

        The dealuminated β zeolite, therefore, serves as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH. The unique structure of hierarchical zeolites, featuring combined micropores and mesopores/macropores, significantly enhances the accessibility for PDH reactions, thereby improving their performance.

        Hierarchical zeolites, like Fe-Silicalite-1, enhance PDH reaction accessibility through combined micropores and mesopores/macropores, offering improved performance over traditional zeolites due to their enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution. Key types include silicalite-1, chabazite, and mordenite. Their synthesis involves hydrothermal treatment and template-directed assembly, making them superior catalysts in PDH reactions.

        The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites, including dealuminated zeolite beta, mesoporous silica materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), typically involves template-directed assembly or sol-gel processes. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by providing more active sites and better selectivity compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and improved stability.

        One-step synthesis of zeolite membranes containing catalytic metal nanoclusters further enhances the performance of PDH reactions. Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, are synthesized using methods such as template-directed synthesis or sol-gel processing. These materials offer superior performance compared to traditional zeolites due to a larger surface area and increased porosity.

        Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550°C. For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream. This showcases the superior performance of hierarchical zeolites in PDH reactions.

        Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition, introduces Sn and Pt species to form Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts. The confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to high efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, highlighting the pivotal role of mesopore confinement in catalyst stability and activity.

        The presence of mesopores plays a dual role in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation: it confines the PtSn particles for stability and accelerates the diffusion rate. The Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, synthesized through mild alkali treatment of ZSM-5, demonstrate exceptional efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a 46% initial conversion and 98% selectivity at 570°C.

        The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhances PDH reaction accessibility. These materials are typically synthesized by incorporating mesoporous or macroporous materials into the zeolite framework, improving catalytic process efficiency through additional pathways for reactants and products.

Key types include those synthesized through various methods, offering enhanced surface areas, controlled pore size distributions, and improved stability compared to traditional zeolites.

        The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of the catalyst, keeping the catalytic activity unchanged after four continuous cycles. This showcases the robustness of hierarchical zeolites in maintaining catalytic performance over multiple cycles, making them suitable for industrial applications in PDH reactions.

        The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites through solvent-free methods further enhances their accessibility for PDH reactions by improving their surface area and pore volume. These materials, featuring well-defined pore structures and high surface areas, offer enhanced catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional zeolites.
