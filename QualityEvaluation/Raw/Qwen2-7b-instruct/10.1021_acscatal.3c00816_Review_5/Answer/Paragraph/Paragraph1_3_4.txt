            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acscatal.1c01497\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.2c05042\] and \[10.1021/acscatal.2c00928\]. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MEL, and BEA structures, synthesized via template-directed assembly or sol-gel processes. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution.

            Hierarchical zeolites, integrating micropores and mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance PDH reaction accessibility. Key types are MFI, MEL, and BEA, synthesized through hydrothermal treatment or template-directed assembly. These materials offer superior performance over traditional zeolites in PDH reactions due to increased surface area and precise pore size control.

            Robust and efficient propane dehydrogenation catalysts from hierarchical zeolites like Fe-Silicalite-1 materials have been developed. These materials combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. Main types include silicalite-1, chabazite, and mordenite, synthesized through hydrothermal and sol-gel methods, respectively. These materials provide more active sites and better diffusion channels for reactants and products, outperforming traditional zeolites in terms of activity and selectivity.

            The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation in hierarchical zeolites like In-CHA confirms its role in enhancing PDH reaction accessibility. Ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations confirm its stability at high temperatures, further highlighting the efficiency of these materials in PDH reactions.

            Hierarchical zeolites, featuring ZSM-5, MFI, and MEL structures, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials are synthesized through hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-directed synthesis, offering enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution. They improve PDH reaction performance by providing larger accessible surface areas and better diffusion pathways, showing superior activity and selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.

            The lower H+ concentration in reduced In-CHA samples compared with H-CHA is additional evidence showing that In+ species rather than InHx were formed at 550°C. The main oxidized species is [InO]+, as supported by XRD revealing no In2O3 diffraction peaks detected on H2-O2 treated In-CHA(11, 1.0).

            The stability of In-CHA exceeds that of In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, with no significant decrease in C3H6 yield over 14 hours. The C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels.

            These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures.

            Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550°C. For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.

            Atomic Insight into the local structure and microenvironment of isolated Co-motifs in MFI zeolite frameworks for propane dehydrogenation reveals the role of hierarchical zeolites in enhancing PDH reaction performance.

            Dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600°C in air were the synthesis methods used to prepare hierarchical zeolites that afford a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst.

            Controlling reaction-induced loss of active sites in ZnOx/Silicalite-1 for durable nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation showcases the durability of these materials, which exhibit better stability and selectivity in PDH processes compared to traditional zeolites.

            The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite after removing Al atoms reduces side reactions, enhancing propylene selectivity. The dealuminated β zeolite provides a positive environment for the dispersion and formation of small ZnO nanoclusters, acting as Lewis acid sites (LAS) for catalyzing PDH. The interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the zeolite framework results in enhanced catalytic activity.

            The combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical zeolites enhances accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include single-crystal house-of-cards-like ZSM-5, synthesized via hydrothermal synthesis and template-directed assembly. These materials offer superior pore structure and increased surface area, outperforming traditional zeolites in PDH reactions by facilitating better accessibility.

            The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to reduced cracking and coking.
            
            The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5. The high efficiency of these catalysts is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, enabling higher conversion and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

            Mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3 confirms the role of hierarchical zeolites in enhancing PDH reaction performance. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are MFI, MEL, and ZSM-5, synthesized via sol-gel, hydrothermal treatment, and ion-exchange. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by providing better thermal stability, selectivity, and activity, thanks to their unique pore architecture, outperforming traditional zeolites.
            
            The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite after removing Al atoms reduces side reactions, enhancing propylene selectivity. The dealuminated β zeolite serves as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH.
            
            The presence of mesopores plays a positive role in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, stabilizing them at high temperatures and accelerating the diffusion rate.
            
            The introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles. The dealuminated β zeolite, therefore, serves as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH.
            
            The combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical zeolites enhances accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are categorized based on their pore size distribution, synthesized via sol-gel, hydrothermal crystallization, or ion-exchange. These materials feature improved stability and activity due to optimized pore structures, offering superior catalytic performance compared to traditional zeolites.
