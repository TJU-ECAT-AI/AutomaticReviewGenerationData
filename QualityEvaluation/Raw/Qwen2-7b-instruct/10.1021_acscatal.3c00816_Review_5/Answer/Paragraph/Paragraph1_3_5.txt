        Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance the accessibility of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key types include MFI, MEL, BEA, TS-1, ZSM-5, Beta, MCM-41, SBA-15, SBA-16, silicalite-1, chabazite, faujasite, mordenite, H-ZSM-5, H-USY, H-MFI, MFI, MEL, BEA, and dealuminated zeolite beta, synthesized through hydrothermal, sol-gel, and template-directed assembly methods. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites due to enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution, as highlighted in the quotes.

        The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MEL, and BEA structures, synthesized via hydrothermal processes or template-directed assembly. They show superior performance in PDH reactions due to their unique pore architectures, as demonstrated in the references.

        These materials also include hierarchical-like Fe-Silicalite-1 materials, which combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance PDH reaction accessibility. Key types are silicalite-1, chabazite, and mordenite, synthesized through hydrothermal treatment and template-directed assembly, offering improved surface area and controlled pore size distribution, as compared to traditional zeolites.

        Hierarchical zeolites, such as ZSM-5, MFI, and MEL, are synthesized via hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-directed synthesis. These materials provide a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants, improving the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

        In addition, the presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation, hierarchical zeolite In-CHA, features an active site [InH2]+ for ethane dehydrogenation, confirmed by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Its stability at 600°C is uncertain, but experiments show that In+ species rather than InHx form at 550°C, indicating the formation of [InO]+ as the main oxidized species.

        The lower H+ concentration in reduced In-CHA samples compared with H-CHA is additional evidence showing that In+ species rather than InHx were formed at 550°C. The experimentally determined ratio of formed water to consumed hydrogen during the entire process was 1.1, indicating that the main oxidized species was [InO]+.

        The C3H6 yield over 14 hours for In-CHA shows better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3. The reaction orders for dehydrogenation and cracking are 0.77 and 0.93, respectively, close to the first order for both reaction channels.

        The main types of hierarchical zeolites are categorized based on their pore size distribution, synthesized through sol-gel, hydrothermal, and microwave-assisted techniques. These materials feature improved stability and activity due to optimized pore structures.

        These materials, including MCM-41, SBA-15, and SBA-16, are synthesized through sol-gel processes and hydrothermal treatments, offering enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution, which improves PDH reaction performance over traditional zeolites.

        The synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites typically involve hydrothermal processes, sol-gel processes, and template-directed synthesis, creating materials with superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution.

        These materials improve PDH reaction performance by providing larger accessible surface areas and better diffusion pathways, showing superior activity and selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.

        These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small metal nanoparticles (MNPs), greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and preventing severe sintering at high temperatures.

        Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550°C. For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.

        In the future, this synthetic strategy may be a promising route for the designed synthesis of small MNPs with controllable particle size through adjustment of the hierarchical structures. These catalysts leverage the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of mesoporous materials, potentially improving PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites.

        Atomic insight into the local structure and microenvironment of isolated Co-motifs in MFI zeolite frameworks for propane dehydrogenation reveals the importance of hierarchical zeolites in optimizing the catalytic process. The design uses robust reactor/catalyst regenerator technology that allows the process to be scaled as needed.

        In summary, hierarchical zeolites are advantageous in PDH reactions due to their ability to integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores, offering enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and improved stability and selectivity. These materials are synthesized through various methods, leading to superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing hierarchical zeolites with tunable pore size distributions for optimal PDH performance. Investigating the synergistic effects of different metal species anchored in hierarchical zeolites could lead to the discovery of novel catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. Additionally, the development of advanced computational tools to predict and design hierarchical zeolite structures tailored for PDH reactions could revolutionize the field, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient propane dehydrogenation processes.
