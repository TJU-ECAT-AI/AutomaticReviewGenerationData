          [1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [2] "Hierarchical zeolites are synthesized through a multi-step process that includes the creation of a template, followed by the incorporation of metal ions and organic linkers to form the zeolite framework."
          [3] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pore structures."

          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to increase the accessibility for PDH reactions. They are synthesized in a multi-step process involving the creation of a template, followed by the addition of metal ions and organic linkers to construct the zeolite framework. These materials surpass traditional zeolites in PDH reaction performance due to their increased surface area and more accessible pore structures.
