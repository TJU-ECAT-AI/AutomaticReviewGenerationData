6. Recent research has predominantly focused on synthesizing ultrasmall noble metal nanoparticles, such as gold (Au), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), ruthenium (Ru), and rhodium (Rh), immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. However, taking into account the advantages of both single-atom and hybrid multimetallic catalysts, the production of individual hybrid atoms supported on nanoporous catalysts appears more promising, and these catalysts are anticipated to deliver exceptional performance due to their enhanced access to multifunctional active sites.
