          [1] "The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was confirmed by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, the stability of this compound at the reaction temperature of 600 C is still uncertain."
          [2] "The lower H+ concentration in reduced In-CHA samples compared with H-CHA is additional evidence showing that In+ species rather than InHx were formed at 550 C."
          [3] "The experimentally determined ratio of formed water to consumed hydrogen during the entire process was 1.1, indicating that the main oxidized species was [InO]+, as supported by XRD that revealed no In2O3 diffraction peaks detected on H2-O2 treated In-CHA(11, 1.0) (Fig. S25)."
          [4] "As shown in Fig. 9a, In-CHA shows better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3. There is no significant decrease of the C3H6 yield over 14 hours (Fig. 9a)."
          [5] "The C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels (Fig. 11a)."

          The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was confirmed by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, its stability at 600°C is uncertain. Reduced In-CHA samples showed lower H+ concentration compared to H-CHA, suggesting In+ species were formed at 550°C instead of InHx compounds. The experimental ratio of water formed to hydrogen consumed throughout the process was 1.1, indicating [InO]+ as the main oxidized species, supported by XRD findings. In-CHA demonstrated superior stability compared to In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, with no significant decrease in C3H6 yield over 14 hours. The reaction orders for propane dehydrogenation and cracking were 0.77 and 0.93, respectively, closely resembling the first-order kinetics for both processes.

          对于乙烯脱氢，[InH2]+ 被确认为活性位点，通过外场傅里叶变换红外光谱（ex situ FTIR）和第一性原理计算得到支持。然而，在600°C下的稳定性仍然不确定。减压后的In-CHA样品的氢离子浓度低于H-CHA，这表明在550°C时形成了In+物种而不是InHx化合物。在整个过程中形成的水与消耗的氢气的比例实验确定为1.1，表明主要的氧化物种是[InO]+，这得到了XRD分析的支持，该分析未在用H2-O2处理的In-CHA(11, 1.0)样品上检测到In2O3的衍射峰。In-CHA显示出比In2O3、10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3更好的稳定性，14小时内C3H6产率没有显著下降。烷烃脱氢和裂解的反应级数分别为0.77和0.93，非常接近两个过程的第一级反应。

          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types are templated synthesis and post-synthesis modification. These materials improve PDH reactions by offering more active sites and routes for reactants.

          [1] "Upon reduction of In-based catalysts, the indium species enter the pores of the zeolite and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated Al."
          [2] "When indium is impregnated on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, In(0) was formed upon reduction (Fig. 1). But note that not all In2O3 is reduced since both In2O3 and In(0) are detected (Fig. 1)."
          [3] "The SEM images (Fig. S3) of the CHA sample show approximately 300 nm, 300 nm, 1 μm, and 1.5 μm sized zeolite crystals for H-CHA(11), H-CHA(5), H-CHA(12), and H-CHA(25), respectively. The surface area of SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 investigated was 285 and 79 m2 g1 (Table S2)."

          Upon reduction of In-based catalysts, indium species enter the pores of the zeolite and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum. When indium is impregnated on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, indium(0) forms upon reduction (Fig. 1). Not all In2O3 is reduced, as both In2O3 and indium(0) are detected (Fig. 1). SEM images (Fig. S3) of the CHA sample show various crystal sizes for different H-CHA samples, ranging from approximately 300 nm to 1.5 μm. The surface area of SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 was found to be 285 and 79 m2/g, respectively (Table S2).
