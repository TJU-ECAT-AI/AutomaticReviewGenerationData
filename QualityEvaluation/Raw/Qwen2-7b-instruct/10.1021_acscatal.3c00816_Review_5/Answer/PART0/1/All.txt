Among various PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst exhibits the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, achieving an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570°C.", "Chinese": "层级沸石通过在介孔中限制PtSn颗粒，以高温度稳定它们，并加速扩散速率来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这使得丙烷可以更容易地接近PtSn颗粒进行脱氢，而丙烯的扩散也变得更快，从而减少了裂解和结焦反应。通过温和的碱溶液处理ZSM-5制备出层状结构，从而形成了具有改进催化性能的层状沸石。在各种PtSn/层状沸石催化剂中，PtSn1.00/层状沸石(0.8)催化剂在570°C时表现出最高的PDH效率，初始转化率为46%，选择性为98%。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cjche.2021.11.020"},
