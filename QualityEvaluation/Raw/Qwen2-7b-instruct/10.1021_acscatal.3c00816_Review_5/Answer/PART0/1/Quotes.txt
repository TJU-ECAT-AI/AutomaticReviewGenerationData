[1] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature. Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate."
