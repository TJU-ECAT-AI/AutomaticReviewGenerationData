          [1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include TS-1, ZSM-5, and Beta zeolites."
          [3] "Synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites typically involve hydrothermal treatment or template-directed synthesis."
          [4] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by providing more active sites and better diffusion channels for reactants and products."
          [5] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show higher activity and selectivity in PDH reactions due to their unique pore structures."

          级联沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔以增强PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括TS-1、ZSM-5和贝塔沸石。合成方法通常涉及水热处理或模板导向合成。这些材料通过提供更多的活性位点和更好的反应物和产物扩散通道，改善PDH反应性能。与传统沸石相比，级联沸石在PDH反应中表现出更高的活性和选择性，这是由于它们独特的孔结构。
