<quote>Significantly, compared with other crystalline nanoporous materials, zeolites exhibit superior thermal and chemical stability even under harsh reaction conditions. Thus far, zeolites have proven to be excellent supports for the confinement synthesis of metal species against aggregation.</quote>
         <quote>Compared with the synthesis of zeolite-supported noble metals, the encapsulation of small transition-metal clusters inside the zeolites is still difficult to be achieved because the transition-metal clusters possess lower redox potential and higher surface free energy than noble-metal clusters, leading to easy and severe aggregations during the reduction process.</quote>
         <quote>In the present progress report, we mainly focus on presenting the state-of-the-art strategies for the fabrication of ultrasmall MNPs, clusters, and even single atoms confined within zeolites and MOFs; the advantages and disadvantages of different methods are also discussed.</quote>
         <quote>The encapsulation of metal clusters within the zeolite framework during the in situ synthetic process is not restricted by the pore size of zeolites because the encapsulating procedure of metal species is synchronized with the crystallization of the zeolites.</quote>
         <quote>Notably, the obtained hollow-metal-encaged zeolite catalysts exhibited excellent shape-selective performance in oxidation and reduction reactions over different substrates with various molecular sizes and configurations, and the micropores of the zeolite shells could block the entrance of toxic molecules to avoid poisoning of the metallic active sites.</quote>
         <quote>With this method, the metal clusters can be encapsulated in MOF shells rather than in the cavities of the MOF structure, which can restrict the breakage of the MOF frameworks. Moreover, the size, composition, and configuration of encapsulated metal clusters can also be controlled according to practical needs.</quote>
