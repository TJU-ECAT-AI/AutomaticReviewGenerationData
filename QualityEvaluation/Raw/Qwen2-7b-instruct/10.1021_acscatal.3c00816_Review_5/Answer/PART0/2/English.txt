2. Zeolites demonstrate superior thermal and chemical stability compared to other crystalline nanoporous materials, even under harsh reaction conditions. They excel in containing metal species against aggregation. Synthesizing noble metals on zeolites is easier than encapsulating small transition-metal clusters, which have lower redox potential and higher surface free energy, leading to aggregation issues during reduction.

Micropores in the zeolite shells prevent toxic molecules from entering, safeguarding the metallic active sites. This method allows metal clusters to be encapsulated within MOF shells, avoiding the breakdown of MOF structures and enabling control over cluster size, composition, and configuration based on practical requirements.
