          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and increased porosity, which facilitates easier access for reactants and products. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are categorized based on their pore size distribution, ranging from micro to meso and macropores. Synthesis methods for these materials include sol-gel, hydrothermal, and microwave-assisted techniques. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering more active sites and better selectivity due to their unique pore structure and enhanced accessibility.
