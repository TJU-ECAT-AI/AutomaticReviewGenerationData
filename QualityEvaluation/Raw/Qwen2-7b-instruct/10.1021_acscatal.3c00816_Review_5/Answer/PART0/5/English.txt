Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. Main types are MCM-41, SBA-15, and SBA-16. Synthesis methods usually involve template-directed assembly and post-synthesis modification. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by offering enhanced surface area and controlled pore structure. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show higher selectivity and activity in PDH reactions due to their distinctive pore architecture.

Raw Hβ zeolite was processed with a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol/L) at 100°C for 10 hours to eliminate the framework aluminum atoms. The dealuminated β zeolite significantly decreases side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites. Consequently, the optimal catalyst consisting of 10 wt% zinc loaded onto the dealuminated β zeolite shows a high initial propane conversion rate of approximately 53% and an excellent propylene selectivity of roughly 93% at a space velocity of 4000 cm³/gcat·h.
