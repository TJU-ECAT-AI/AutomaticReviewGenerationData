          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The synthesis methods for these materials involve dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600°C in air. These materials offer a green, nonprecious, and highly effective catalyst for PDH reactions, surpassing traditional zeolites in terms of performance.

          "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          "Dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600 C in air were used to prepare CoOx confined in the SiBeta zeolite."
          "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."
          "Confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."

          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The synthesis methods for these materials involve dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600°C in air. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a propane conversion of 72% with a propylene selectivity of 92%. Confined CoOx species in the SiBeta zeolite can be reduced to metallic Co particles during the PDH reaction, leading to similar catalytic performance for CoSiBeta catalysts, regardless of whether they undergo a pre-reduction treatment.

          "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          "CoSiBeta catalysts have state-of-the-art productivity for direct dehydrogenation of propane."
          "CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance."
          "The CoSiBeta catalysts include highly dispersed metallic Co and CoO particles that are formed in ambient atmosphere."
          "The real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts."
          "Small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."

          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. CoSiBeta catalysts demonstrate state-of-the-art productivity for direct dehydrogenation of propane. Catalysts with or without prereduction treatment exhibit similar catalytic performance. The CoSiBeta catalysts incorporate highly dispersed metallic Co and CoO particles formed in ambient atmosphere. The active sites in the PDH reaction might not be the initial materials, explaining why catalysts like 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta display comparable catalytic performance. The reduction of confined CoOx generates small metallic Co particles, which serve as active sites showing excellent catalytic activity and high product selectivity, along with ideal reusability.

          层次结构沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。CoSiBeta催化剂在直接脱氢丙烷方面展现出尖端生产力。无论是否进行预还原处理，催化剂均表现出类似的催化性能。CoSiBeta催化剂包含了在大气环境中形成的高度分散的金属钴和CoO颗粒。PDH反应中的活性位点可能并非初始材料，这可能是为什么像10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta这样的催化剂显示出相似的催化性能的原因。通过还原受限的CoOx生成的小型金属钴颗粒作为活性位点，显示出了出色的催化活性和高产品选择性，以及理想的可重复使用性。
