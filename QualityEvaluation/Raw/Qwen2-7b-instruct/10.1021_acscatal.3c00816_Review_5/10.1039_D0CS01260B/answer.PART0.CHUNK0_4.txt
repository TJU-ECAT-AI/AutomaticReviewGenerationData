1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve access for PDH reactions. They offer better mass transport properties compared to traditional zeolites, which can boost the performance of PDH reactions.

2. In PtLa/meso-MFI zeolites, the silanol nests enable rare-earth elements to act as high-chemical potential single-atom species that preferentially migrate to Pt sites, enhancing the catalytic activity.

3. The PtGa/CeAl2O3 catalyst utilizes the solgel synthesis chemistry to disperse Ce atoms on γ-Al2O3, which strengthens the Pt stabilization through robust PtOCe bonds, contributing to the catalyst's stability.

4. Synthesis of hierarchical zeolites typically involves the use of templates to create ordered pore structures, which are crucial for the enhanced performance of PDH reactions.

5. The hierarchical structure in zeolites improves mass transport properties, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.
