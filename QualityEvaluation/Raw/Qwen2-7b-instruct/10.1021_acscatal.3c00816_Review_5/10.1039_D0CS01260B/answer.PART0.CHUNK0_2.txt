[1] "For a 5% CeCr/Al2O3 catalyst, the amounts of inactive isolated Cr(IV) site and oxygen vacancy are decreased and increased, respectively, because of a promoted CeCr interaction."
[2] "An enhanced SMSI between Cr species and Al2O3 support through high-temperature reduction treatment by H2 induces the migration of active Cr sites into the substrate layers of Al2O3."
[3] "The interaction between Cr and support can be modified by the Ce, Zr or Sn additive."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level pathway for reactant and product diffusion. Micropores offer a high surface area for adsorption, while mesopores/macropores facilitate faster diffusion and easier access to the active sites. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MCM-22, and SBA-15. These materials are synthesized using methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel methods, and microwave-assisted synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by offering a better balance between adsorption capacity and diffusion rates, leading to increased activity and selectivity.

层次型沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性，通过提供多级通道来促进反应物和产物的扩散。微孔提供了高比表面积以吸附，而介孔/大孔则有利于更快的扩散和更易接近活性位点。层次型沸石的主要类型包括MFI、MCM-22和SBA-15。这些材料通过模板导向合成、水热合成和微波辅助合成等方法制备。与传统沸石相比，层次型沸石通过提供更好的吸附容量和扩散率之间的平衡，提高了PDH反应性能，从而导致活性和选择性的增加。
