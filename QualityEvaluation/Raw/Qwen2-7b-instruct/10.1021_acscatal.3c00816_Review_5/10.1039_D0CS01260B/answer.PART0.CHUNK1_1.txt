1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores or macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. They are primarily synthesized through repetitive branching synthesis techniques or by employing long chain alkyl structure directing agents. These materials outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reaction performance due to enhanced diffusion pathways and increased surface areas that facilitate reactant access and product release.

[1] "The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount."
[2] "For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16)."
[3] "The volcano-shape variation of the TOF values further suggests that the isolated V3+ species are more catalytically active in comparison with other V sites."

2. The existing states for vanadium (V) species on the supports are influenced by the loading amount. For VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts made through incipient wetness impregnation, isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species appear at surface densities of 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Figure 16). The volcano-shaped variation in turnover frequency (TOF) values indicates that isolated V3+ species exhibit higher catalytic activity compared to other V sites.
