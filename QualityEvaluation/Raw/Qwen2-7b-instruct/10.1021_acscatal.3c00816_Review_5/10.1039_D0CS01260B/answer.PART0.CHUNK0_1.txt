[1] "The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "For instance, the structureactivity relationships have also been established for the subnanometric Pt sites confined in microporous zeolites, including MFI-type zeolites of ZSM-5, silicalite-1 and TS-1, beta zeolites, etc."
[3] "Considering that these zeolites possess micropores and cavities at different dimensions, one of the fundamental challenges is to precisely and selectively localize the metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another one is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reductive atmosphere."
[4] "The introduction of a moderate amount of K+ to compensate the silanol groups does not affect the hydrothermal synthesis stage, and nonetheless, it significantly suppresses the sintering of Pt nanoclusters into large nanoparticles during the calcination process through a stabilization effect."
[5] "Furthermore, the zeolite itself can interact with the reaction-relevant molecules or intermediates in the reaction for changing the pathway."
[6] "The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals introduces the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm size."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. This allows for precise and selective localization of metal sites in zeolite structures, which in turn helps stabilize these sites against processes like Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures. The strong interaction between silanol defect sites in hierarchical zeolites like silicalite-1 and Pt metals leads to the formation of small Pt nanoparticles, which are advantageous for PDH reactions. Additionally, zeolites can interact with reaction-relevant molecules or intermediates, altering the pathway of the reaction. This combination of features improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

层次结构的沸石将微孔和介孔/大孔结合在一起，以增强PDH反应的可访问性。这允许在沸石结构中精确选择性地定位金属位点，从而有助于稳定这些位点，防止在高温还原气氛下的晶粒生长或聚集过程。层次结构沸石如硅酸盐-1中的硅醇缺陷位点与铂金属之间的强烈相互作用导致形成约2nm大小的铂纳米颗粒，这对PDH反应有利。此外，沸石可以与反应相关分子或中间体相互作用，改变反应路径。这种组合特性提高了PDH反应的性能，与传统沸石相比。
