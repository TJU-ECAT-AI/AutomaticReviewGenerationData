[1] "For a PtSn catalyst supported on Al2O3-modified SBA-15 (PtSn/Al2O3/SBA-15), shows a higher activity than that of the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst and a higher stability than that of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for the PDH reactions, due to the mesoporous structure and the enhanced interaction between PtSn and the additive Al2O3 species on the PtSn/Al2O3/SBA-15 catalyst."
[2] "For the PDH reaction at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst displays a higher activity than that of the impregnated Pt/MCM-22 catalyst with 1.5 nm Pt nanoparticles at the external surfaces."
[3] "For the as-synthesized Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species are single-atoms and <0.7 nm clusters captured by the hemi-cages and supercages, exhibiting high structural stability under both thermal and PDH reaction conditions."
[4] "The internal dimensions of the cup-like hemi-cages and the supercages of the MCM-22 zeolite are 0.7 and 0.7 × 1.8 nm, respectively. The supercages can theoretically contain the Pt nanoclusters with 1013 atoms."
[5] "Considering that these zeolites possess micropores and cavities at different dimensions, one of the fundamental challenges is to precisely and selectively localize the metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another one is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reductive atmosphere."
[6] "The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals introduces the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm size."
[7] "In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability."
