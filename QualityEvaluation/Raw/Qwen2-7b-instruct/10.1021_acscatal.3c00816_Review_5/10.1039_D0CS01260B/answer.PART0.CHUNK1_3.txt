[1] "The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount. For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16)."
[2] "For the VOx/Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) supports with 10 and 1 wt% of SiO2, the VOx species show the highest space-time yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 mcat3 h1 at a propane conversion of 30% at 550 C, respectively."
[3] "For the 60-VOxSiO2-580 catalyst (60 and 580 represent the temperature of gelation and calcination, respectively), the propane conversion shows a decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4 h PDH reaction, and the propylene selectivity remains 91% over eight cycles of reaction and regeneration."

1. The distribution of vanadium species on the supports is influenced by the loading amount. In VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, isolated vanadium, polymetric VOx, and crystalline V2O5 species are formed at surface densities of 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively. 

2. Supported VOx catalysts on Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with 10 and 1 wt% of SiO2 exhibit the highest space-time yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 mcat3 h1 at a propane conversion of 30% at 550 C, respectively.

3. The 60-VOxSiO2-580 catalyst, with the temperature of gelation and calcination represented by 60 and 580, respectively, shows a decrease in propane conversion from 55% to 45% within a 4-hour PDH reaction, while the propylene selectivity remains at 91% over eight cycles of reaction and regeneration.

1. 支持在负载量影响下，五氧化二钒物种在γ-Al2O3上的分布。通过浸渍湿法制备的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂中，孤立的五氧化二钒、聚合态VOx和结晶态V2O5物种分别在表面密度达到0.7、3.9和13.1 V nm2时形成。

2. Al2O3SiO2（Siral）支持的VOx催化剂，含有10wt%和1wt%的SiO2，分别在550°C下转化率为30%时，显示出最高的空间时间产率146和158 kgC3H6 mcat3 h1。

3. 表示凝胶化和煅烧温度分别为60和580的60-VOxSiO2-580催化剂，在4小时的PDH反应中，丙烷转化率从55%降低到45%，而丙烯选择性保持在91%的水平上，经过八次反应和再生循环。
