[1] "The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount."
[2] "For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16)."
[3] "Similar to the CrOx-based catalysts that possess the redox of various Cr-relevant surface species during the reactions, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, different kinds of V species are included in the working VOx catalysts, such as monomeric, polymeric and crystalline VOx species with +3+5 valences."
[4] "The changes in both structure and chemical state of the active VOx sites are significantly determined by their interaction with the employed supports."
[5] "For the VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration."
[6] "The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration."

1. The distribution of vanadium (V) species on the supports is dependent on the loading amount.
2. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different V loadings produce isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystalline V2O5 species when the surface density reaches specific values.
3. Vanadium species in the working VOx catalysts include monomeric, polymeric, and crystalline VOx species with +3+5 valences, similar to chromium (Cr) species in CrOx catalysts.
4. The structure and chemical state of active vanadium oxide (VOx) sites are significantly influenced by their interaction with the support material.
5. Supported VOx catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species show superior selectivity towards propylene and better time-on-stream stability compared to industrially relevant CrOx and PtSn catalysts.
6. Supported VOx catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species outperform CrOx and PtSn catalysts in terms of propylene selectivity and time-on-stream stability in non-oxidative PDH reactions and oxidative regeneration cycles.
