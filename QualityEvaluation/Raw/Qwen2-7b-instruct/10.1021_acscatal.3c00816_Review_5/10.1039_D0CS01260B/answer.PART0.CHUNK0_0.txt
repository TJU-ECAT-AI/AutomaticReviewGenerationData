<p>For the high-sphericity Al2O3 spheres that are prepared by a modified oil-drop solgel method, the aging temperature determines the pore size and volume as well as the surface acidity.</p>
<p>The interactions between PtSn species and Al2O3 support aged at different temperatures are distinct. With increasing aging temperature, both the dispersion of Pt and total acid content show volcano-shape patterns, while the interaction between Al2O3 and Sn species is enhanced for inhibiting the reduction of SnOx to metallic Sn0.</p>
<p>A high strength of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can prevent the sintering of PtSn sites by the SMSI effect, while the low amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can reduce the deposition of coke species during the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Modification by doping has been approved as an effective strategy to improve the catalytic DH performances of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts, and the dopants include transition metals or rare earth metals (e.g., Ce, Zr, Y, Mg, etc.) and nonmetals (e.g., carbon and boron species).</p>
<p>In the case of a PtGa/CeAl2O3 catalyst, the atomic dispersion of Ce on γ-Al2O3via the solgel synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds.</p>
<p>When Ga3+ cations are incorporated into the cubic fluorite CeO2 on Al2O3, the reducibility of CeO2 can be enhanced to promote the desorption of propylene and the elimination of the deposited coke in the PtGa/CeO2Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reaction.</p>
<p>The addition of a proper amount of Ga species can also decorate and modify the Pt sites via the formation of PtGa alloys.</p>
<p>A hierarchical MgAl2O4 with flower-like morphology is used to support PtSn bimetals, achieving a high stability in ten cycles of PDH reaction and regeneration.</p>
<p>The presence of the penta-coordinated Al3+ in Al2O3 also contributes to the high dispersion of Pt and Ga species on the support. Both the hydrogen spillover and the synergistic function between Pt and reduced Ga2O3 sites are facilitated, consequently promoting the catalytic activity and stability of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Decorating functional layers on top of the Al2O3 surfaces is also an available approach to modify the structure-property relationship of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts. The oxide-based nano islands decorated on the surface of the Al2O3 support can effectively modify the surface acid-base property and provide new anchor sites for the active metallic species through different interactions.</p>
<p>Modification by doping has been approved as an effective strategy to improve the catalytic DH performances of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts, and the dopants include transition metals or rare earth metals (e.g., Ce, Zr, Y, Mg, etc.) and nonmetals (e.g., carbon and boron species).</p>
<p>Zeolites can be widely used as promising porous supports to encapsulate small nanoparticles, nanoclusters and even single-atoms of metals for heterogeneous dehydrogenation catalysis. To a certain extent, the zeolite provides a confinement effect to stabilize the metal sites against sintering at high operation temperatures or in various reaction atmospheres.</p>
<p>The encapsulation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy nanoclusters by the nanosized MFI-structure silicalite-1 zeolites is achieved by a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method.</p>
<p>The presence of the framework-confined Sn species in the dealuminated Si-beta zeolites influences the chemical state and catalytic PDH property of the encapsulated Pt sites.</p>
<p>The surface framework defects of silanol nests on the pore walls of the mesoporous MFI-type degallated zeolites can induce the formation of intermetals of Pt and rare-earth element, e.g., PtLa, PtCe and PtY.</p>
<p>The presence of the framework-confined Sn species in the dealuminated Si-beta zeolites influences the chemical state and catalytic PDH property of the encapsulated Pt sites.</p>
<p>Considering the weaker acidity of the TS-1 zeolite relative to the Al-ZSM-5 zeolites that may inhibit side-reactions of CC cracking and coking, TS-1-supported PtSn catalysts are attempted in the PDH reactions.</p>
<p>The PtSn catalyst in the minimal particle size TS-1 zeolites (100 nm) displays a superior catalytic PDH performance than the catalysts supported on the large-size TS-1 zeolites (0.25.7 μm), owing to the hierarchically porous structure for a promoted mass transportation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the surface acidity of the zeolite can also determine the location position and state of the Pt sites. The relatively stronger acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolites can prevent the impregnation of the H2PtCl6 precursors into the channels, and consequently most of the Pt particles disperse on the external surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, relatively weaker acidic ZSM-5 zeolites allow most of the Pt species to enter the porous spaces with the coexistence of both small clusters and large particles.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a confinement effect to stabilize metal sites against sintering at high temperatures. They can encapsulate metals in the zeolite framework, confining them to specific positions and states. The synthesis methods involve sol-gel processes, templating, and impregnation, leading to materials with high surface areas, ordered pore structures, and tailored surface properties. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by promoting mass transport, stabilizing metal sites, and controlling the location and state of Pt sites.

2. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites often involves using hard templates like CMK-3 to create ordered mesoporous structures, which can provide a high specific surface area and controlled pore size. These features are advantageous for supporting Pt metals, enabling high dispersion and accessibility. Additionally, the use of soft templates can lead to the formation of hierarchical structures with both micropores and mesopores, which can further enhance the catalytic properties by optimizing the interaction between Pt sites and reactants.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer several advantages in PDH reactions. They can encapsulate Pt metals in a controlled manner, leading to improved stability and selectivity. The hierarchical structure allows for optimized mass transport, which can enhance the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the tailored surface properties of these zeolites can influence the catalytic activity and selectivity, making them suitable for the selective dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

4. The use of hierarchical zeolites in PDH reactions can lead to enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique combination of pore sizes and surface chemistry. These materials can encapsulate Pt metals efficiently, leading to high dispersion and accessibility, which are critical for the dehydrogenation process. The hierarchical structure also facilitates better mass transport, which can improve the reaction rate and selectivity. Furthermore, the tailored surface properties of these zeolites can be optimized to enhance the catalytic activity and stability, making them promising candidates for PDH applications.
