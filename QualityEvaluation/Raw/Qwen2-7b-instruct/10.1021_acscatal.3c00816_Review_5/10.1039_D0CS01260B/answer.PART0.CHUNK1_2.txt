For the Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx- and Sn/SnOx-based catalysts, the metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes. The structure-performance relationships of Co-based DH catalysts are reviewed and their corresponding possible reaction mechanisms are also discussed in this section (Table 5).

For the Co-catalyzed activation and functionalization of CH bonds in the hydrocarbons, such as direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and cycloalkanes, their development has achieved notable success. The metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes. 

For the Co-contained cluster sites supported on Zr-based nodes (MOF-type NU-1000 support), their CH activation ability can be regulated by the doping of a second metal. In view of the diversity in the hydrogen-abstracting and alkane-adsorption abilities among these CoOM clusters, the energy barrier for the propane CH activation varies from 56.9 to 9.3 kcal mol1.

The ultrasmall metallic Co0 clusters confined in the dealuminated beta zeolite have been recently reported to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the PDH reactions, and the optimal 0.5 wt% Co@Sibeta catalyst displays 57% initial conversion and 96% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 600 C. The highly dispersed CoOx species are anchored on the vacant T-sites (with silanols) of Sibeta zeolite in the as-obtained catalyst, and the transformation of these reducible CoOx into the metallic Co can easily occur during the PDH reactions.

1. 在Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx-和Sn/SnOx基催化剂中，金属态Co0、氧化态Co+、Co2+和Co3+在孤立或聚集状态被认为是烷烃中CH键活化的主要活性位点。这些催化剂在直接和氧化脱氢烷烃和环烷烃方面取得了显著的进步。

2. 在Co催化下的烷烃CH键活化和功能化中，金属态Co0、氧化态Co+、Co2+和Co3+在孤立或聚集体形式被识别为烷烃中CH键活化的活性位点。

3. 支撑在Zr基节点（MOF类型的NU-1000支持）上的Co包含簇可以通过引入第二种金属来调节其CH激活能力。这些CoOM簇中的CH激活能壁垒范围从56.9到9.3 kcal mol1，反映了它们在氢提取和烷烃吸附方面的不同能力。
