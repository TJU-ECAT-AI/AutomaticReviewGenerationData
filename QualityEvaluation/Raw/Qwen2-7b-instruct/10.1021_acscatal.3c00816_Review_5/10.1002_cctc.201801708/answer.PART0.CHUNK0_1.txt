[1] "Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, can enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "Main types include dealuminated zeolites, with dealumination methods typically involving acid treatment to remove aluminum atoms from the framework."
[3] "Dealuminated zeolites improve PDH performance by reducing side reactions, thanks to the absence of strong acid sites."
[4] "These materials offer a wider pore size distribution compared to traditional zeolites, enhancing the catalytic sites for PDH reactions."

1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. Main types are dealuminated zeolites, often processed through acid treatment to eliminate aluminum atoms from the framework. This enhances PDH performance by minimizing side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, compared to traditional zeolites.
