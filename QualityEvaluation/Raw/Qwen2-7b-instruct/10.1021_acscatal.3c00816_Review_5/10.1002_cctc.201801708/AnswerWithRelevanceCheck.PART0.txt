          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. Key types are dealuminated β zeolites, featuring vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. These are synthesized via a two-step post-synthesis method involving dealumination and conventional impregnation, leading to the creation of small ZnO nanoclusters that serve as active phases in PDH. Compared to traditional zeolites, dealuminated β zeolites exhibit superior PDH reaction performance due to their unique pore structure. The absence of strong acid sites reduces side reactions, improving propylene selectivity. As a support, dealuminated β zeolite facilitates the dispersion and formation of small ZnO nanoclusters, which act as Lewis acid sites (LAS) for catalyzing PDH. These LAS, resulting from the interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the zeolite framework, contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity.

          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve accessibility for PDH reactions. Major types are dealuminated zeolites, where the dealumination process usually entails acid treatment to eliminate aluminum atoms from the framework. This leads to reduced side reactions and enhanced PDH performance due to the lack of strong acid sites. These materials feature a broader pore size range than conventional zeolites, which boosts the catalytic sites for PDH reactions.

          [1] "The dealuminated β zeolite, possessing a great deal of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, can be used as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed SN ZnO by the host-guest interaction."
          [2] "The creation of vacant T-atom sites is advantageous for constraining SN ZnO within the zeolite framework, thereby reducing the likelihood of inactive bulk ZnO formation on the external surface of the zeolite."
          [3] "The highly dispersed SN ZnO in or bonded to the zeolite framework as LAS are catalytically active sites in PDH."

      <English>
          The dealuminated β zeolite, characterized by numerous vacant T-atom sites linked to silanol groups, can serve as an ideal substrate for acquiring well-dispersed SN ZnO through host-guest interactions. The formation of vacant T-atom sites benefits in confining SN ZnO within the zeolite matrix, thus minimizing the formation of inactive bulk ZnO on the zeolite surface. The highly dispersed SN ZnO embedded in or attached to the zeolite framework act as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which are catalytically active in PDH.

          [1] "Raw Hβ zeolite was treated with concentrated nitric acid solution (13molL1) at 100C for 10h to get rid of the framework Al atoms."
          [2] "DeAlβ zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites."
          [3] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1."

          Raw Hβ zeolite was processed with a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol/L) at 100°C for 10 hours to eliminate the framework aluminum atoms. The dealuminated β zeolite significantly decreases side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites. Consequently, the optimal catalyst consisting of 10 wt% zinc loaded onto the dealuminated β zeolite shows a high initial propane conversion rate of approximately 53% and an excellent propylene selectivity of roughly 93% at a space velocity of 4000 cm³/gcat·h.
