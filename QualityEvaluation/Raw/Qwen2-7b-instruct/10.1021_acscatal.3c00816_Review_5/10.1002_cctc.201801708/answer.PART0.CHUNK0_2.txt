[1] "The dealuminated β zeolite, possessing a great deal of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, can be used as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed SN ZnO by the host-guest interaction."
[2] "The creation of vacant T-atom sites is advantageous for constraining SN ZnO within the zeolite framework, thereby reducing the likelihood of inactive bulk ZnO formation on the external surface of the zeolite."
[3] "The highly dispersed SN ZnO in or bonded to the zeolite framework as LAS are catalytically active sites in PDH."
</quotes>

3. The dealuminated β zeolite, characterized by numerous vacant T-atom sites coupled with silanol groups, serves as an ideal substrate for acquiring well-dispersed SN ZnO through host-guest interactions. The formation of vacant T-atom sites facilitates the confinement of SN ZnO within the zeolite matrix, minimizing the appearance of inactive bulk ZnO on the zeolite surface. The highly dispersed SN ZnO embedded in or bonded to the zeolite framework act as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which are catalytically active in PDH.

3. 拟铝化β沸石，具备大量与硅醇基团关联的T-原子位点，可以用作通过主客体相互作用获取均匀分散的SN ZnO的理想支撑物。T-原子位点的产生有利于限制SN ZnO在沸石框架内的存在，从而降低在沸石表面形成无活性大块ZnO的可能性。嵌入或结合在沸石框架中的高度分散的SN ZnO作为Lewis酸位（LAS），在PDH中表现出催化活性。
