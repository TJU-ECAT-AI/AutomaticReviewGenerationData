[1] "Hierarchical zeolites are designed to combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include dealuminated β zeolites, which possess a great deal of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups."
[3] "Dealuminated β zeolites can be synthesized through a two-step post-synthesis method involving dealumination and conventional impregnation procedures."
[4] "This synthesis method allows for the creation of a large amount of small ZnO nanoclusters, which act as active phases in PDH."
[5] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites like dealuminated β zeolites show improved performance in PDH reactions due to their unique pore structure."
[6] "The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite after removing Al atoms reduces side reactions, enhancing propylene selectivity."
[7] "The dealuminated β zeolite as a support provides a positive environment for the dispersion and formation of small ZnO nanoclusters."
[8] "Small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the zeolite framework act as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which are active for catalyzing PDH."
[9] "These LAS derived from the interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the zeolite framework are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity."
[10] "The dealuminated β zeolite, therefore, serves as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters with catalytic activity for PDH."

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. Key types include dealuminated β zeolites, characterized by vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. These are synthesized via a two-step method involving dealumination and conventional impregnation. Compared to traditional zeolites, dealuminated β zeolites exhibit superior PDH reaction performance due to their unique pore structure. The absence of strong acid sites, following Al atom removal, minimizes side reactions, enhancing propylene selectivity. The dealuminated β zeolite functions as an optimal support for dispersing small ZnO nanoclusters, which act as active Lewis acid sites (LAS) in PDH. These LAS, resulting from the interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the zeolite framework, drive enhanced catalytic activity.

层状沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括去铝β沸石，具有与硅醇基团相关的T-原子位点。这些通过包含去铝和常规浸渍的两步合成方法进行合成。与传统沸石相比，去铝β沸石由于其独特的孔结构，在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能。去除铝原子后，强酸位点的缺失减少了副反应，提高了丙烯选择性。因此，去铝β沸石作为在沸石框架中分散小型ZnO纳米簇的理想支持，这些纳米簇作为PDH中的活性Lewis酸位点（LAS）起作用。这些LAS源自Zn物种与沸石框架中硅醇基团的相互作用，推动了催化活性的增强。

[1] "The dealuminated β zeolite, possessing a great deal of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, can be used as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed SN ZnO by the host-guest interaction."
[2] "The creation of vacant T-atom sites is advantageous for constraining SN ZnO within the zeolite framework, thereby reducing the likelihood of inactive bulk ZnO formation on the external surface of the zeolite."

3. The dealuminated β zeolite, characterized by numerous vacant T-atom sites coupled with silanol groups, serves as an ideal substrate for acquiring well-dispersed SN ZnO through host-guest interactions. The formation of vacant T-atom sites facilitates the confinement of SN ZnO within the zeolite matrix, minimizing the appearance of inactive bulk ZnO on the zeolite surface. The highly dispersed SN ZnO embedded in or bonded to the zeolite framework act as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which are catalytically active in PDH.
