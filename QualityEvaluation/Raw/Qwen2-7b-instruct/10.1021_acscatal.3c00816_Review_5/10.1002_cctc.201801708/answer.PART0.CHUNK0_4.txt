[1] "Hierarchical zeolites, which combine micropores and mesopores/macropores, can enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to enter and exit the material."
[2] "Main types of hierarchical zeolites include templated synthesis, post-synthesis modification, and natural occurrence. Synthesis methods involve creating the hierarchical structure during the zeolite formation process."
[3] "These materials improve PDH reaction performance by allowing for more efficient diffusion and reaction pathways, reducing the likelihood of side reactions, and increasing the contact area between reactants and catalyst sites."
[4] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites can offer better catalytic activity and selectivity due to their enhanced structural features that facilitate more controlled and efficient reactions."

Hierarchical zeolites, integrating micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by offering various routes for reactants and products to traverse the material. Key types of these materials encompass templated synthesis, post-synthesis modifications, and natural occurrences. Synthesis methods typically involve constructing the hierarchical structure during the zeolite creation process. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by optimizing diffusion and reaction pathways, minimizing side reactions, and increasing the surface area for contact between reactants and catalyst sites. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit superior catalytic activity and selectivity due to their refined structural attributes that enable more precise and efficient reactions.
