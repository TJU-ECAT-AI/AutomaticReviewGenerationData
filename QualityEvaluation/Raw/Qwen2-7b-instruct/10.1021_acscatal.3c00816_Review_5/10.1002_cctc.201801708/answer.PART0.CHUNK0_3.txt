1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. This combination allows for better control over the reaction environment and improved catalytic performance.

2. The raw Hβ zeolite was subjected to a treatment with a concentrated nitric acid solution at 100°C for 10 hours to eliminate the framework aluminum atoms.

3. The dealuminated β zeolite effectively suppresses side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites.

4. The optimal catalyst, containing 10wt% zinc loaded onto dealuminated β zeolite, demonstrated a high initial propane conversion rate of approximately 53% and an exceptional propylene selectivity of around 93% at a space velocity of 4000 cm³/gcat·h.

1. 分级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可访问性。这种组合允许对反应环境进行更好的控制并提高催化性能。

2. 原始Hβ沸石通过在100°C下用浓硝酸溶液处理10小时来去除框架铝原子。

3. 去铝β沸石有效抑制了由于缺乏强酸位点而引起的副反应。

4. 含有10wt%锌负载在去铝β沸石上的最优催化剂，其初始丙烷转化率约为53%，丙烯选择性约达93%，空间速度为4000 cm³/gcat·h。
