Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types include MFI, MEL, and BEA structures, which are synthesized through hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-directed assembly. These materials improve PDH reactions by increasing the surface area and pore volume, providing better control over particle size and shape, and offering enhanced stability and activity compared to traditional zeolites.
