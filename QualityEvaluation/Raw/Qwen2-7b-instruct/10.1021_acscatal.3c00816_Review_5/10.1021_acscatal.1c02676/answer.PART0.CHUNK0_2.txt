1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials are TS-1, Beta, and MCM-41. They are synthesized using a blend of template-directed self-assembly and sol-gel techniques. These materials outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reactions because of their increased surface area and pore structure.
