1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials are TS-1, ZSM-5, and MFI. They are synthesized through methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel process, and hydrothermal treatment. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials enhance PDH reaction performance due to improved accessibility, increased surface area, and controlled pore size distribution.
