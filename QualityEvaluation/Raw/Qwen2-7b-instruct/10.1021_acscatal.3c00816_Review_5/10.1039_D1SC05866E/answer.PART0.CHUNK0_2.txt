Upon reduction of In-based catalysts, the indium species enter the pores of the zeolite and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated Al. When indium is impregnated on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, In(0) was formed upon reduction (Fig. 1). But note that not all In2O3 is reduced since both In2O3 and In(0) are detected (Fig. 1).

For the sample H-CHA(11), the 27Al solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) spectrum was dominated by a strong sharp signal at 54 ppm, which is assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated framework Al in the zeolite, and a weak feature at 0 ppm in the 27Al MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. S2) is assigned to a small amount of extra-framework Al (AlEF), as octahedral aluminum (around 15%).

The SEM images (Fig. S3) of the CHA sample show approximately 300 nm, 300 nm, 1 μm, and 1.5 μm sized zeolite crystals for H-CHA(11), H-CHA(5), H-CHA(12), and H-CHA(25), respectively. The surface area of SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 investigated was 285 and 79 m2 g1 (Table S2).

The reduction of In-based catalysts leads to indium species entering the zeolite pores and interacting with tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum. On silica and alumina supports, indium(0) forms upon reduction, though not all indium oxide (In2O3) is reduced, leaving both In2O3 and indium(0) detected. The 27Al SS-NMR spectrum of H-CHA(11) indicates tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum with a small amount of extra-framework aluminum. SEM images reveal various crystal sizes for different H-CHA samples, and the specific surface areas of silica and gamma-alumina are given.

对于基于铟的催化剂，其还原导致铟物种进入沸石孔并与四面体配位的铝相互作用。在硅胶和氧化铝支持下，还原后形成铟(0)，但并非所有氧化铟（In2O3）都被还原，因此检测到两者均存在。H-CHA(11)的27Al SS-NMR谱表明四面体配位的框架铝，并且有少量额外框架铝。SEM图像显示了不同H-CHA样品的晶体尺寸差异，而二氧化硅和γ-氧化铝的特定表面积也给出了。
