[1] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations;33,34 however, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[2] "The higher Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."
[3] "The C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels (Fig. 11a)."

1. The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was mainly supported by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, the stability of indium hydride at the reaction temperature of 600°C needs further confirmation because the spectra used were collected at a low temperature after hydrogen treatment at 773 K.
2. A higher Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolites improves propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by reducing the number of cages with multiple In+ cations.
3. The reaction orders for propane dehydrogenation and cracking over the In-CHA catalyst were 0.77 and 0.93, respectively, closely resembling the first-order kinetics for both processes.

1. 对于乙烯脱氢，[InH2]+ 的活性位点主要通过外场傅里叶变换红外光谱（ex situ FTIR）和第一性原理计算支持。然而，在反应温度600°C下，铟氢化合物的稳定性需要进一步验证，因为用于支持其存在的光谱是在773 K条件下氢处理后在低温下收集的。
2. CHA沸石中的较高Si/Al比通过降低包含多个In+离子笼子的比例来提高丙烷脱氢（PDH）性能。
3. In-CHA催化剂上的丙烷脱氢和裂解的反应顺序分别为0.77和0.93，分别接近两个过程的零级动力学。
