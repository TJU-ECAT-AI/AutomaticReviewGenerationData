1. The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was mainly supported by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, the stability of indium hydride at the reaction temperature of 600°C needs further confirmation because the spectra used were collected at a low temperature after hydrogen treatment at 773 K.
2. A higher Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolites improves propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by reducing the number of cages with multiple In+ cations.
3. The reaction orders for propane dehydrogenation and cracking over the In-CHA catalyst were 0.77 and 0.93, respectively, closely resembling the first-order kinetics for both processes.

[2] "The lower H+ concentration in reduced In-CHA samples compared with H-CHA is additional evidence showing that In+ species rather than InHx were formed at 550 C."
[3] "Overall, the ratio of formed H2O/consumed H2 during the entire experiment was estimated to be 1.1; that is, the main oxidized species was [InO]+, as supported by XRD that revealed no In2O3 diffraction peaks detected on H2-O2 treated In-CHA(11, 1.0) (Fig. S25)."
[4] "On In-CHA with different Si/Al ratios (Fig. 4a and S11), the H2/In ratios are close to 1.0, confirming that In2O3 in the CHA zeolite can be reduced to replace BASs and form isolated In+ when In/Al ratios ≥ 1.0 (independently of the Si/Al ratio)."
[5] "As shown in Fig. 9a, In-CHA shows better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3. There is no significant decrease of the C3H6 yield over 14 hours (Fig. 9a)."

1. The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was confirmed by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, the stability of this compound at the reaction temperature of 600 C is still uncertain.
2. The reduced In-CHA samples showed a lower concentration of hydrogen ions compared to H-CHA, providing evidence that In+ species were formed at 550 C rather than InHx compounds.
3. The experimentally determined ratio of formed water to consumed hydrogen during the entire process was 1.1, indicating that the main oxidized species was [InO]+. This finding was corroborated by XRD analysis, which did not detect any diffraction peaks of In2O3 on the H2-O2 treated In-CHA(11, 1.0) sample.
4. The H2/In ratios of the In-CHA samples with various Si/Al ratios were close to 1.0, confirming that In2O3 could be reduced to form isolated In+ species in the CHA zeolite when the In/Al ratio was ≥ 1.0, irrespective of the Si/Al ratio.
5. In-CHA demonstrated better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, as evidenced by the absence of significant decrease in the C3H6 yield over 14 hours.
6. The reaction orders for propane dehydrogenation and cracking were 0.77 and 0.93, respectively, closely resembling the first-order reaction for both processes.

Upon reduction of In-based catalysts, the indium species enter the pores of the zeolite and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated Al. When indium is impregnated on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, In(0) was formed upon reduction (Fig. 1). But note that not all In2O3 is reduced since both In2O3 and In(0) are detected (Fig. 1).

For the sample H-CHA(11), the 27Al solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) spectrum was dominated by a strong sharp signal at 54 ppm, which is assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated framework Al in the zeolite, and a weak feature at 0 ppm in the 27Al MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. S2) is assigned to a small amount of extra-framework Al (AlEF), as octahedral aluminum (around 15%).

The reduction of In-based catalysts leads to indium species entering the zeolite pores and interacting with tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum. On silica and alumina supports, indium(0) forms upon reduction, though not all indium oxide (In2O3) is reduced, leaving both In2O3 and indium(0) detected. The 27Al SS-NMR spectrum of H-CHA(11) indicates tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum with a small amount of extra-framework aluminum. SEM images reveal various crystal sizes for different H-CHA samples, and the specific surface areas of silica and gamma-alumina are given.

Upon reduction of In-based catalysts, the indium species enter the pores of the zeolite and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated Al. When indium is impregnated on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, In(0) was formed upon reduction (Fig. 1). But note that not all In2O3 is reduced since both In2O3 and In(0) are detected (Fig. 1).

Bulk In2O3, however, shows a much higher reduction temperature with the reduction peak centered at around 700 C; that is, bulk In2O3 is harder to reduce (consistent with the observation of Jones and coworkers).39 The higher reduction temperature explains the large amount of In2O3 observed by XRD after reducing the In2O3 catalyst (Fig. 1).

Quantification of the H2 consumption from H2-TPR profiles and H2 pulses and corresponding O2 consumption from O2 pulses Sample H2/In (H2-TPR) H2/In (H2-pulse) O/In (O2 pulse) In2O3 1.05 10In/SiO2 0.88 0.25  0.02 0.12  0.01 10In/Al2O3 0.86 0.46  0.01 0.44  0.02 In-CHA(11, 1.0) 0.98 0.86  0.02 0.86  0.02 In-CHA(11, 1.0), (H2-O2 treated)  0.92  0.02 0.92  0.02

Identification of isolated In+ sites We have employed a pulse-reactor and in situ FTIR spectroscopy to determine that isolated In+ sites are the stable species formed upon reduction of the In-CHA catalyst with H2. In fact, the ratio between the formed H2O and consumed H2 at the reaction temperature is consistent with isolated In+ sites as the stable indium species: as shown in Fig. 3a, the ratio of formed H2O/consumed H2 was 1.5 for the impregnated/calcined In2O3/CHA. As a control experiment, the formed H2O/consumed H2 ratio on CuO was determined to be 1.0, which is consistent with the stoichiometry during reduction (Fig. 3b and S9).

Propane dehydrogenation mechanism on isolated In+ sites PDH catalytic rates and selectivity were measured on the reduced In-based catalyst. Calcined catalysts were reduced in 10 vol% H2 for 30 min at 600 C before the introduction of 2.54 kPa C3H8 (balancing N2). At comparable conversion (<6%), In-CHA shows better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3. There is no significant decrease of the C3H6 yield over 14 hours (Fig. 9a). A long-term test of the 10In/Al2O3 sample (Fig. S26) shows that the C3H6 yield keeps decreasing within a time on stream of 65 hours, evidencing that indium supported on Al2O3 exhibited poor stability for propane dehydrogenation. Isolated In+ sites in In-CHA(11, 1.0) show good C3H6 selectivity (85%) at 600 C (Fig. 9b), higher than the selectivity exhibited by the other samples.

Hierarchical zeolites, which combine micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and improved pore connectivity. This allows for easier diffusion of reactants and products, improving overall catalytic efficiency. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:

1. **Mesoporous zeolites**: These zeolites have a size range between 2 and 50 nanometers, offering a balance between surface area and pore volume. They are often synthesized through methods like template-directed synthesis, where a mesogenic molecule acts as a template to direct the growth of zeolite crystals.

2. **Macroporous zeolites**: With pore sizes greater than 50 nanometers, these zeolites offer easy access to their interior, making them ideal for reactions involving larger molecules. They are typically created through sacrificial template methods, where a porous material is used as a template to create the macroporous structure.

3. **Hybrid zeolites**: These materials combine features of both microporous and mesoporous or macroporous zeolites, providing a unique combination of properties. They can be synthesized through methods like grafting, where microporous zeolites are attached to the surfaces of mesoporous or macroporous materials.

Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reactions in several ways:

- **Enhanced surface area**: Hierarchical zeolites have a higher surface area, which increases the number of active sites available for PDH reactions.
  
- **Improved pore architecture**: The combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores creates a more efficient pathway for reactants and products, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

- **Better accessibility**: The larger pore sizes in mesoporous and macroporous zeolites allow for easier diffusion of reactants and products, leading to faster reaction kinetics.

- **Stability**: Hierarchical zeolites often exhibit enhanced stability under harsh reaction conditions, allowing for prolonged use in PDH processes without significant loss of activity.

These advancements make hierarchical zeolites promising candidates for enhancing the performance of PDH reactions, particularly in comparison to traditional zeolites that might suffer from lower surface areas, restricted pore architectures, or reduced stability.

层级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的表面积和改进的孔连接性来增强PDH反应的可访问性。这允许反应物和产物更容易扩散，从而提高整体催化效率。层级沸石的主要类型包括：

1. **介孔沸石**：这些沸石的尺寸范围在2到50纳米之间，提供了表面面积和孔体积之间的平衡。它们通常是通过模板导向合成制备的，其中一种介孔分子作为模板来指导沸石晶体的生长。

2. **大孔沸石**：具有大于50纳米的孔径，这些沸石因其内部易于进入而非常适合涉及较大分子的反应。它们通常通过牺牲模板方法制备，其中使用一种多孔材料作为模板来创建多孔结构。

3. **混合沸石**：这些材料结合了微孔和介孔或大孔沸石的特点，提供了一种独特的组合特性。它们可以通过嫁接等方法合成，其中将微孔沸石附着到介孔或大孔材料的表面上。

与传统沸石相比，层级沸石在PDH反应中表现出以下优势：

- **增加的表面积**：层级沸石具有更高的表面积，提供了更多的活性位点以进行PDH反应。

- **改进的孔架构**：微孔和介孔/大孔沸石的结合创造了一个更有效的途径，用于反应物和产物的扩散，从而提高了催化效率。

- **更好的可访问性**：介孔和大孔沸石的较大孔径允许反应物和产物更容易扩散，导致更快的反应动力学。

- **稳定性**：层级沸石通常在苛刻的反应条件下表现出增强的稳定性，允许在PDH过程中长时间使用而不显著损失活性。

这些进展使层级沸石成为增强PDH反应性能的有前景的候选材料，特别是与可能因较低的表面积、受限的孔架构或减少的稳定性而表现不佳的传统沸石相比。
