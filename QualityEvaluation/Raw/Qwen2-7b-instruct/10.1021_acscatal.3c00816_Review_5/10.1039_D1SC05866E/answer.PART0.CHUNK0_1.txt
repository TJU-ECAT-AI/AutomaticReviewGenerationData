[1] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations;33,34 however, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[2] "The lower H+ concentration in reduced In-CHA samples compared with H-CHA is additional evidence showing that In+ species rather than InHx were formed at 550 C."
[3] "Overall, the ratio of formed H2O/consumed H2 during the entire experiment was estimated to be 1.1; that is, the main oxidized species was [InO]+, as supported by XRD that revealed no In2O3 diffraction peaks detected on H2-O2 treated In-CHA(11, 1.0) (Fig. S25)."
[4] "On In-CHA with different Si/Al ratios (Fig. 4a and S11), the H2/In ratios are close to 1.0, confirming that In2O3 in the CHA zeolite can be reduced to replace BASs and form isolated In+ when In/Al ratios ≥ 1.0 (independently of the Si/Al ratio)."
[5] "As shown in Fig. 9a, In-CHA shows better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3. There is no significant decrease of the C3H6 yield over 14 hours (Fig. 9a)."
[6] "The C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels (Fig. 11a)."

1. The presence of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was confirmed by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, the stability of this compound at the reaction temperature of 600 C is still uncertain.
2. The reduced In-CHA samples showed a lower concentration of hydrogen ions compared to H-CHA, providing evidence that In+ species were formed at 550 C rather than InHx compounds.
3. The experimentally determined ratio of formed water to consumed hydrogen during the entire process was 1.1, indicating that the main oxidized species was [InO]+. This finding was corroborated by XRD analysis, which did not detect any diffraction peaks of In2O3 on the H2-O2 treated In-CHA(11, 1.0) sample.
4. The H2/In ratios of the In-CHA samples with various Si/Al ratios were close to 1.0, confirming that In2O3 could be reduced to form isolated In+ species in the CHA zeolite when the In/Al ratio was ≥ 1.0, irrespective of the Si/Al ratio.
5. In-CHA demonstrated better stability than In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, as evidenced by the absence of significant decrease in the C3H6 yield over 14 hours.
6. The reaction orders for propane dehydrogenation and cracking were 0.77 and 0.93, respectively, closely resembling the first-order reaction for both processes.

1. [InH2]+作为乙烷脱氢反应活性位点的存在，通过外场FTIR光谱和DFT计算得到了证实。然而，在600°C的反应温度下，这种化合物的稳定性仍需进一步验证。
2. 减压后的In-CHA样品的氢离子浓度较低，这提供了In+物种在550°C时形成而非InHx化合物的证据。
3. 实验确定的生成水与消耗氢气的比例在整个过程中为1.1，表明主要氧化物种是[InO]+。这一发现得到了XRD分析的支持，该分析未在经H2-O2处理的In-CHA(11, 1.0)样品上检测到In2O3的衍射峰。
4. 不同Si/Al比例的In-CHA样品的H2/In比接近1.0，证明了当In/Al比≥1.0时，In2O3可以在CHA沸石中被还原为孤立的In+物种，与Si/Al比例无关。
5. In-CHA显示出了比In2O3、10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3更好的稳定性，没有显著降低的C3H6产率持续了14小时。
6. 烷烃脱氢和裂解的反应级数分别为0.77和0.93，非常接近两个过程的第一级反应。
