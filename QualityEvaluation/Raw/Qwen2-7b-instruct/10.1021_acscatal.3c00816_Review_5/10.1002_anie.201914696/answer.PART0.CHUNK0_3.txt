[B-MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single-Site Catalysis] Zeolites, microporous, crystalline materials composed of characteristic SiO4 tetrahedra, are among the most widely used industrial catalysts.1 The so-called T-sites may be replaced with different atoms via isomorphous substitution to tune the catalytic properties by for example altering the Bronsted/Lewis acidity or creating a catalytic center. Isomorphous substitution can be achieved directly via hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthetically by methods, including impregnation and ion-exchange.2, 3 Although widely applied in industry, isomorphously substituted zeolites are still the subject of many ongoing studies.4 Boron-containing materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes, have been shown to be highly selective catalysts for the transformation of light alkanes to olefins via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).5-11 Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06).12 To understand the function of this oxidized boron phase, we recently investigated silica-supported boron oxide (B/SiO2) materials, which showed a similar conversion-selectivity trend and product distribution to the bulk boron-containing catalysts.13 While these results confirm that the active site is most likely contained in the oxidized boron phase, the precise reaction mechanism and active site structure have not been identified. Magic angle spinning (MAS) 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy (SSNMR) analysis of the B/SiO2 materials revealed the B2(OH)xO3x/2 phase restructures under ODH reaction conditions to give a higher degree of boron agglomeration. The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides.14 The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions preclude the precise experimental identification of the active site(s).

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a high surface area and controlled pore size distribution, which allows for efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. Main types of these materials include hydrothermally synthesized zeolites, post-synthetically modified zeolites through impregnation or ion-exchange, and boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced porosity, improved surface chemistry, and ability to selectively catalyze specific reactions. The precise synthesis methods involve hydrothermal processes for direct incorporation of substituents like boron into the zeolite framework, and post-synthetic treatments to modify surface properties or create specific active centers.

层状沸石通过提供高比表面积和可控孔径分布，结合微孔、介孔和大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料的主要类型包括水热合成的沸石、通过浸渍或离子交换进行后合成改性的沸石，以及硼含量材料如六方氮化硼和硼纳米管。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在性能上的改进是由于它们增强了孔隙度、改善了表面化学性质，并能够选择性地催化特定反应。精确的合成方法包括通过水热过程直接将如硼这样的取代基整合入沸石骨架中，以及通过后合成处理来修改表面特性或创建特定活性中心。
