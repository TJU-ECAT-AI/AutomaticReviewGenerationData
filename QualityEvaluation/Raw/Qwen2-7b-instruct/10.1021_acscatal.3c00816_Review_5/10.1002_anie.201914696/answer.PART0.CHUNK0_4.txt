[1] "Magic angle spinning (MAS) 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy (SSNMR) analysis of the B/SiO2 materials revealed the B2(OH)xO3x/2 phase restructures under ODH reaction conditions to give a higher degree of boron agglomeration."
[2] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site."

This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of boron-containing zeolite MCM-22 (B-MWW), which was synthesized through hydrothermal methods. The key finding is that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 units, rather than being part of an active site for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The authors argue that the catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The results highlight that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane likely proceeds over boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, rather than isolated BO3 sites.

本研究关注了通过水热合成方法制备的硼含量沸石MCM-22（B-MWW）的合成与表征。主要发现是，硼完全嵌入到沸石骨架中作为孤立的BO3单元，而不是作为氧化脱氢（ODH）丙烷的活性位点。作者认为，B-MWW对丙烷的ODH反应无催化活性，否定了孤立BO3单元是硼基催化剂活性位点的假设。结果表明，硼催化的丙烷ODH反应可能在具有某些程度的B-O-B连接的硼物种上进行，而不是孤立的BO3位点。
