[1] "MWW is an industrially prepared catalyst used as an additive to ZSM-5 for catalytic cracking, in Mobil's Badger Cumene process for the alkylation of benzene, the alkylation of toluene, and the liquid phase epoxidation of propylene."
[2] "The borosilicate form of MWW (also called ERB-1) is used primarily as an intermediate for creating high Si/Al ratio frameworks and for the post-synthetic incorporation of metals into the structure."
[3] "Surprisingly, the B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e., <0.5% conversion)."
[4] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

1. Zeolites, particularly MWW, are utilized in various industrial processes such as catalytic cracking, alkylation of benzene and toluene, and the liquid phase epoxidation of propylene. The borosilicate form of MWW serves as a precursor for synthesizing zeolites with high Si/Al ratios and facilitates the post-synthetic incorporation of metals into the structure.

2. The B-MWW material did not exhibit any conversion of propane to propene above the background level, indicating that it lacks catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

3. The study concludes that for boron-catalyzed ODH of propane, active catalysts require boron species with some degree of boron-boron connectivity rather than isolated BO3 sites. This insight advances the understanding of the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts.

1. MWW是一种工业催化剂，用于催化裂解、苯和甲苯的烷基化以及丙烯的液相环氧反应。硼硅酸盐形式的MWW主要用作合成高Si/Al比框架结构和后合成金属掺杂结构的中间体。

2. B-MWW材料在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中没有表现出任何丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率，这表明它缺乏对丙烷ODH的催化活性。

3. 研究得出结论，对于硼催化丙烷ODH，活性催化剂需要具有某些程度的硼-硼连接的硼物种，而不是孤立的BO3位点。这一发现深化了对高度选择性ODH催化剂分子起源的理解。
