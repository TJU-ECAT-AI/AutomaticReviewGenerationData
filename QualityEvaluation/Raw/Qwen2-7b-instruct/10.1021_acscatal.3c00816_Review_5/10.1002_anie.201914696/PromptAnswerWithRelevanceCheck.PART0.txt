[1] "MWW is an industrially prepared catalyst used as an additive to ZSM-5 for catalytic cracking, in Mobil's Badger Cumene process for the alkylation of benzene, the alkylation of toluene, and the liquid phase epoxidation of propylene."
[2] "The borosilicate form of MWW (also called ERB-1) is used primarily as an intermediate for creating high Si/Al ratio frameworks and for the post-synthetic incorporation of metals into the structure."
[3] "Surprisingly, the B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e., <0.5% conversion)."
[4] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

1. Zeolites, particularly MWW, are utilized in various industrial processes such as catalytic cracking, alkylation of benzene and toluene, and the liquid phase epoxidation of propylene. The borosilicate form of MWW serves as a precursor for synthesizing zeolites with high Si/Al ratios and facilitates the post-synthetic incorporation of metals into the structure.

2. The B-MWW material did not exhibit any conversion of propane to propene above the background level, indicating that it lacks catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

3. The study concludes that for boron-catalyzed ODH of propane, active catalysts require boron species with some degree of boron-boron connectivity rather than isolated BO3 sites. This insight advances the understanding of the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts.

1. MWW是一种工业催化剂，用于催化裂解、苯和甲苯的烷基化以及丙烯的液相环氧反应。硼硅酸盐形式的MWW主要用作合成高Si/Al比框架结构和后合成金属掺杂结构的中间体。

2. B-MWW材料在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中没有表现出任何丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率，这表明它缺乏对丙烷ODH的催化活性。

3. 研究得出结论，对于硼催化丙烷ODH，活性催化剂需要具有某些程度的硼-硼连接的硼物种，而不是孤立的BO3位点。这一发现深化了对高度选择性ODH催化剂分子起源的理解。

[1] "Although widely applied in industry, isomorphously substituted zeolites are still the subject of many ongoing studies."
[2] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure (see Supporting Information)."
[3] "The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1)."
[4] "The boron content did not change, within the error margin of the experiment, indicating that there was insignificant leaching during reaction."
[5] "As a further control, we performed ODH catalytic testing for a catalyst made by incipient wetness impregnation of boron onto the B-MWW zeolite, denoted B/B-MWW."
[6] "Clearly, the B(OSi)2(OH) sites now make up a larger fraction of the boron species in B/B-MWW."
[7] "To estimate the 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance for each pair of 1H-11BNMR signals and thus provide a more detailed structure of boron incorporation into the zeolite framework, we recorded 1H-11B dipolar recoupling build-up curves using the 11B1H D-RINEPT sequence."

In the context of hierarchical zeolites, they integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The hierarchical structure allows for a higher surface area and pore volume, which increases the contact area between reactants and catalysts. This enhancement facilitates the diffusion of reactants into the pores and products out of the catalyst, improving the efficiency of PDH reactions.

Regarding the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, isomorphous substitution is a common technique used to create hierarchical zeolites. This involves replacing specific atoms in the zeolite framework with different atoms to alter the catalytic properties. The process typically includes direct hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthetic methods like impregnation and ion-exchange. Hydrothermal synthesis involves reacting the components at high temperatures and pressures to form the desired zeolite structure.

These hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering a higher surface area and pore volume, which can lead to increased reactivity and selectivity. They facilitate more efficient access of reactants to the active sites and allow for easier product release, ultimately enhancing the overall catalytic activity and efficiency of PDH processes.

The stability of the catalyst during the PDH reaction, as evidenced by the unchanged boron content in B-MWW, demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure in maintaining the integrity of the active sites. This stability is crucial for sustained performance over multiple reaction cycles, which is a key factor in the practical application of these catalysts.

Finally, the detailed characterization of B-MWW through multi-dimensional 1H and 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy provided insights into the structure of boron incorporation within the zeolite framework. The study revealed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units, which are adjacent to silanol groups. The hierarchical structure, with its micropores and mesopores/macropores, is instrumental in accommodating these boron species and facilitating the PDH reaction. The stability of these isolated boron sites under reaction conditions further highlights the importance of the hierarchical structure in enabling effective catalysis.

在异晶替换多孔材料中，微孔与介孔或大孔的结合提高了PDH反应的可及性。这种层级结构提供了更高的比表面积和孔体积，增加了反应物与催化剂之间的接触面积。这增强了扩散效率，使得反应物能够更有效地进入孔道并使产物得以释放，从而提高PDH反应的效率。

这些材料的主要类型和合成方法包括异晶替换技术。这种方法通常涉及直接的水热合成或后合成方法，如浸渍和离子交换。水热合成是在高温高压条件下进行，以形成所需的多孔材料结构。

与传统多孔材料相比，这些层级结构的多孔材料在PDH反应中的性能得到改善，主要得益于其更高的比表面积和孔体积。这可以导致更高的反应活性和选择性。它们有助于更有效地将反应物带到活性位点，并允许更容易的产品释放，最终提高催化活性和PDH过程的整体效率。

B-MWW催化剂在PDH反应过程中保持稳定的特性，表明层级结构对于维持活性位点的完整性至关重要。这种稳定性对于实现多次反应循环的持续性能是关键因素，在实际应用中至关重要。

最后，通过多维1H和11B固体状态核磁共振光谱对B-MWW的详细表征揭示了硼在多孔材料框架中的结构。研究发现，硼主要存在于孤立的B(OSi)3单元中，这些单元邻近硅醇基团。层级结构，包括微孔和介孔或大孔，对于容纳这些硼物种并促进PDH反应至关重要。在反应条件下这些孤立的硼位点的稳定性进一步强调了层级结构在有效催化中的重要性。

[B-MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single-Site Catalysis] Zeolites, microporous, crystalline materials composed of characteristic SiO4 tetrahedra, are among the most widely used industrial catalysts.1 The so-called T-sites may be replaced with different atoms via isomorphous substitution to tune the catalytic properties by for example altering the Bronsted/Lewis acidity or creating a catalytic center. Isomorphous substitution can be achieved directly via hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthetically by methods, including impregnation and ion-exchange.2, 3 Although widely applied in industry, isomorphously substituted zeolites are still the subject of many ongoing studies.4 Boron-containing materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes, have been shown to be highly selective catalysts for the transformation of light alkanes to olefins via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).5-11 Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06).12 To understand the function of this oxidized boron phase, we recently investigated silica-supported boron oxide (B/SiO2) materials, which showed a similar conversion-selectivity trend and product distribution to the bulk boron-containing catalysts.13 While these results confirm that the active site is most likely contained in the oxidized boron phase, the precise reaction mechanism and active site structure have not been identified. Magic angle spinning (MAS) 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy (SSNMR) analysis of the B/SiO2 materials revealed the B2(OH)xO3x/2 phase restructures under ODH reaction conditions to give a higher degree of boron agglomeration. The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides.14 The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions preclude the precise experimental identification of the active site(s).

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a high surface area and controlled pore size distribution, which allows for efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. Main types of these materials include hydrothermally synthesized zeolites, post-synthetically modified zeolites through impregnation or ion-exchange, and boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced porosity, improved surface chemistry, and ability to selectively catalyze specific reactions. The precise synthesis methods involve hydrothermal processes for direct incorporation of substituents like boron into the zeolite framework, and post-synthetic treatments to modify surface properties or create specific active centers.

This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of boron-containing zeolite MCM-22 (B-MWW), which was synthesized through hydrothermal methods. The key finding is that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 units, rather than being part of an active site for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The authors argue that the catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. The results highlight that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane likely proceeds over boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, rather than isolated BO3 sites.
