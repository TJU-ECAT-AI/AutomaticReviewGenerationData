[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a unique pore network that facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include MFI, BEA, and ZSM-5 frameworks. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal processes, sol-gel methods, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better stability, selectivity, and activity due to their tailored pore structures and the presence of isolated boron species that can efficiently activate oxygen and propane, while hindering full boron hydrolysis, thus enhancing water tolerance and durability.
