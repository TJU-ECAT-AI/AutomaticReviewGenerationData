[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and increased pore volume. This allows for better distribution of reactants and products, improving the efficiency of the PDH reactions. The main types of these materials include MFI, BEA, and Beta zeolites. Synthesis methods typically involve a sol-gel process, followed by heat treatment to crystallize the zeolite structure. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating easier access to the active sites, reducing diffusion limitations, and enhancing the stability and longevity of the catalyst due to their unique pore architecture.
