[1] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days."
[2] "By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[3] "BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure."
[4] "For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation."
[5] "The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst-1 h-1) of 3600 L kg−1 h−1."
[6] "The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature."
[7] "The BS-1 catalyst exhibited propene and ethene selectivities (based on carbon atoms) of 60.9 and 25.7% at a low propane conversions of 5.3%, giving an overoxidized propane selectivity of <0.5%."
[8] "In ODHP, high propane conversion usually leads to easy overoxidation (18)."
[9] "By contrast, high olefin selectivity (>81.2%) was always obtained over the BS-1 catalyst in a wide range of propane conversions (3.8 to 41.4%)."
[10] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants to access the active sites. This structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, allowing for higher conversion rates and selectivities. The main types of these materials include zeolites with MFI, MWW, and BEA frameworks, synthesized via a solvent-free crystallization strategy followed by calcination to remove organic templates. These materials are synthesized by loading boron species onto S-1 zeolite and amorphous silica through impregnation. The improved performance is attributed to the zeolite structure's ability to hinder full hydrolysis and dissolution of boron species, leading to an ideal catalyst with water tolerance. This approach provides new opportunities for the rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts by incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework.

这些层次结构的沸石通过提供更大的表面积和更多的通道，使反应物能够接近活性位点，结合微孔、介孔和大孔来增强PDH反应的可访问性。与传统沸石相比，这种结构提高了PDH反应的性能，允许更高的转化率和选择性。这些材料的主要类型包括具有MFI、MWW和BEA框架的沸石，通过无溶剂结晶策略合成并随后进行煅烧以去除有机模板。这些材料通过浸渍法将硼物种负载到S-1沸石和非晶二氧化硅上。改进的性能归因于沸石结构阻止硼物种完全水解和溶解的能力，导致具有良好耐水性的理想催化剂。这种方法为在沸石框架中引入硼位点以设计高效脱氢化催化剂提供了新的机会。
