[1] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[2] "The BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure (figs. S1 and S2)."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology."
[4] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products to diffuse. The main types of these materials include MFI, BEA, and ZSM-5 zeolites. Synthesis methods often involve sol-gel processes, hydrothermal treatments, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by enhancing the dispersion of active sites, promoting faster kinetics, and increasing the stability of the catalyst under harsh reaction conditions. The improved accessibility and stability lead to higher yields of desired products and better selectivity.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface area and large pore volumes. This allows for easier diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include MFI, MEL, and BEA zeolites. Synthesis methods typically involve sol-gel processes, template-directed synthesis, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better thermal stability, enhanced selectivity for propene, and improved resistance to deactivation due to hydrolysis. The specific example given pertains to the BS-1 catalyst, which demonstrates high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions, maintaining its performance over extended periods in humid atmospheres.

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants to access the active sites. This structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, allowing for higher conversion rates and selectivities. The main types of these materials include zeolites with MFI, MWW, and BEA frameworks, synthesized via a solvent-free crystallization strategy followed by calcination to remove organic templates. These materials are synthesized by loading boron species onto S-1 zeolite and amorphous silica through impregnation. The improved performance is attributed to the zeolite structure's ability to hinder full hydrolysis and dissolution of boron species, leading to an ideal catalyst with water tolerance. This approach provides new opportunities for the rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts by incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework.
