Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface area and large pore volumes. This allows for easier diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include MFI, MEL, and BEA zeolites. Synthesis methods typically involve sol-gel processes, template-directed synthesis, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better thermal stability, enhanced selectivity for propene, and improved resistance to deactivation due to hydrolysis. The specific example given pertains to the BS-1 catalyst, which demonstrates high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions, maintaining its performance over extended periods in humid atmospheres.
