[1] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[2] "The BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure (figs. S1 and S2)."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology."
[4] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products to diffuse. The main types of these materials include MFI, BEA, and ZSM-5 zeolites. Synthesis methods often involve sol-gel processes, hydrothermal treatments, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by enhancing the dispersion of active sites, promoting faster kinetics, and increasing the stability of the catalyst under harsh reaction conditions. The improved accessibility and stability lead to higher yields of desired products and better selectivity.
