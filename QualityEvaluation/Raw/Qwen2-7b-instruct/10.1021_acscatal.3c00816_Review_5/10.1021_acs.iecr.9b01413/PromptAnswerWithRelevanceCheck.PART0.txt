[1] "Sn was doped into SBA-15, and the resulting material was further applied as support (SSF) to disperse the active phases Pt."
[2] "The introduction of promotors did not change significantly the porous property but affected dramatically the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, etc., which finally acted differently in determining the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene and the catalytic stability."
[3] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."
[4] "On the other hand, it could be easily found that the sintering of active metallic Pt and the coke deposition were still the main reasons responsible for the catalytic deactivation."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. The micropores allow for the confinement of molecules, increasing the likelihood of collisions and reactions, while the mesopores/macropores facilitate diffusion and transport of molecules between the micropores. This combination improves the overall efficiency of the PDH reactions.

2. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include SBA-15, MCM-41, and silicalite-1. These materials are synthesized using hydrothermal methods, typically involving the sol-gel process or template-directed self-assembly. They are known for their well-defined pore structures and high surface areas, which contribute to their enhanced catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

3. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites like SBA-15 typically involves the use of surfactants or polymers as templates to create a hierarchical structure with a combination of micropores and mesopores. This results in materials with superior properties compared to traditional zeolites, such as increased surface area, tunable pore sizes, and enhanced stability, leading to improved performance in PDH reactions.

4. The sintering of active metallic Pt and the coke deposition remain the primary reasons for catalytic deactivation in PDH reactions. Hierarchical zeolites mitigate these issues by providing a more stable environment for the Pt catalyst, reducing the risk of sintering and enhancing the resistance to coke formation, thereby improving the overall catalytic stability.

1. 分级沸石通过提供多个反应物和产物通道来增强丙烷脱氢反应的可接近性，结合了微孔和介孔/大孔。微孔允许分子的限制，增加了碰撞和反应的可能性，而介孔/大孔则促进分子在微孔之间的扩散和运输。这种组合提高了PDH反应的整体效率。

2. 主要的分级沸石类型包括SBA-15、MCM-41和硅酸铝。这些材料通过水热方法合成，通常涉及溶胶-凝胶过程或模板导向自组装。它们以其定义明确的孔结构和高比表面积而闻名，这些特性对PDH反应的催化性能有显著影响。

3. SBA-15等分级沸石的合成通常使用表面活性剂或聚合物作为模板来创建具有微孔和介孔的层次结构。这导致了比传统沸石更稳定的材料，具有更高的比表面积、可调的孔径大小以及增强的稳定性，从而改善了PDH反应的催化性能。

4. 在PDH反应中，活性金属Pt的烧结和焦炭沉积仍然是催化剂失活的主要原因。分级沸石通过提供一个更稳定的环境来减轻这些问题，减少Pt催化剂的烧结风险，并增强其对焦炭形成的抵抗力，从而提高整体催化稳定性。

1. Hierarchical zeolites, like SBA-15, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pore space. This increases the chances for reactants to reach and interact with the active sites. The main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. Synthesis methods typically involve hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel processes, and template-directed assembly. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer enhanced accessibility and better selectivity in PDH reactions due to their tailored pore structures and surface chemistry.

2. The introduction of promoters like Ce, In, La, and Fe into the Pt/SSF catalysts affects its reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and coke deposition. These changes determine the catalytic activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, In promotes the reduction of Pt species and stabilizes the metallic Pt under reaction conditions, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability.

3. In the presence of In as a promoter, the Pt/SSF catalyst forms larger amounts of surface Pt oxides. In addition, In promotes the reduction of these oxides and stabilizes the metallic Pt particles. This results in a Pt-rich surface, which is beneficial for improving the catalytic stability of the Pt/SSF catalyst in PDH reactions.

4. The Fe-promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involves the most lattice oxygen, which correlates with the initial conversion of propane and the catalytic activity. This indicates that the lattice oxygen capacity plays a crucial role in the initial activity of the catalyst in PDH reactions.

5. All promoted catalysts, including those with Ce, In, La, and Fe promoters, exhibit higher initial propane consumption rates and improved propylene generation rates compared to the base Pt/SSF sample. This suggests that the introduction of promoters enhances the activity of the Pt-based catalysts in PDH reactions.

6. The In-promoted catalyst InPt/SSF demonstrates an excellent ability to improve the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. Its application in the activation of light alkanes holds great potential due to its superior performance in terms of stability and propylene selectivity.

1. 阶梯型沸石（如SBA-15）通过提供更大的表面积和更易于访问的孔隙空间，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强了丙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点可达性。主要类型包括介孔和大孔沸石。合成方法通常涉及水热合成、溶胶-凝胶过程和模板导向组装。与传统沸石相比，阶梯型沸石在PDH反应中提供了增强的可达性和更好的选择性，这是由于其定制的孔结构和表面化学性质。

2. 将Ce、In、La、Fe等促进剂引入到Pt/SSF催化剂中，显著影响其可还原性、基本性、Pt表面积、金属Pt颗粒稳定性以及焦炭沉积等特性。这些变化决定了丙烷脱氢反应的催化活性和稳定性。例如，In有助于形成更多的表面Pt氧化物，并在反应条件下促进其还原和金属Pt颗粒的稳定化，从而增强丙烯选择性和稳定性。

3. 在In作为促进剂的情况下，Pt/SSF催化剂形成了更多的表面Pt氧化物。此外，In促进了这些氧化物的还原并稳定了金属Pt颗粒。这导致了Pt丰富的表面形成，这对于提高Pt/SSF催化剂在PDH反应中的催化稳定性具有益处。

4. 含有In作为促进剂的FePt/SSF催化剂涉及最多的晶格氧，这与丙烷初始转化率和催化剂活性相关联。这表明晶格氧容量在PDH反应中对催化剂的初始活性起着关键作用。

5. 包含Ce、In、La、Fe促进剂的所有催化剂均表现出比基Pt/SSF样品更高的初始丙烷消耗速率和改进的丙烯生成速率。这表明促进剂的引入增强了基于Pt的催化剂在PDH反应中的活性。

6. InPt/SSF催化剂显示出卓越的催化稳定性改善能力，在丙烷脱氢反应中。其在轻烷烃活化方面的应用潜力巨大，特别是考虑到其出色的稳定性和丙烯选择性。
