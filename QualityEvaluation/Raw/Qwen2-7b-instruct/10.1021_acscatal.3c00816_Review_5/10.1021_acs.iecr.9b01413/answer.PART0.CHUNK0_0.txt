Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing better diffusion pathways for reactants and products. Common types include SBA-15, MCM-41, and MCM-48, which are synthesized through hydrothermal processes or template-directed assembly. Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites due to their tailored pore size distribution.

层级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性，提供更好的反应物和产物扩散途径。常见的类型包括SBA-15、MCM-41和MCM-48，它们通过水热合成或模板导向组装进行合成。与传统沸石相比，层级沸石在PDH反应中表现出改进的性能，这归因于它们的孔径大小分布的定制设计。
