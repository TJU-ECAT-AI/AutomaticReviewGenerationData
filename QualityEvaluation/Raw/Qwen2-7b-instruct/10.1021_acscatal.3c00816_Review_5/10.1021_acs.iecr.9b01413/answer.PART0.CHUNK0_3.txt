[1] "Sn was doped into SBA-15, and the resulting material was further applied as support (SSF) to disperse the active phases Pt."
[2] "The introduction of promotors did not change significantly the porous property but affected dramatically the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, etc., which finally acted differently in determining the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene and the catalytic stability."
[3] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions."
[4] "Fe promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involved most lattice oxygen which was directly linked to the initial conversion of propane by correlating the catalytic activity and the lattice oxygen capacity."
[5] "All promoted catalysts showed higher initial propane consumption rates from 9.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat. compared with the base Pt/SSF sample (9.2 (μmol/s)/gcat.) and improved propylene generation rates from 8.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat.."
[6] "In this work, the In promoted catalyst InPt/SSF showed its good ability in improving the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, which also offered great potential for its application to the activation of light alkanes."

1. Hierarchical zeolites, like SBA-15, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pore space. This increases the chances for reactants to reach and interact with the active sites. The main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. Synthesis methods typically involve hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel processes, and template-directed assembly. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer enhanced accessibility and better selectivity in PDH reactions due to their tailored pore structures and surface chemistry.

2. The introduction of promoters like Ce, In, La, and Fe into the Pt/SSF catalysts affects its reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and coke deposition. These changes determine the catalytic activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, In promotes the reduction of Pt species and stabilizes the metallic Pt under reaction conditions, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability.

3. In the presence of In as a promoter, the Pt/SSF catalyst forms larger amounts of surface Pt oxides. In addition, In promotes the reduction of these oxides and stabilizes the metallic Pt particles. This results in a Pt-rich surface, which is beneficial for improving the catalytic stability of the Pt/SSF catalyst in PDH reactions.

4. The Fe-promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involves the most lattice oxygen, which correlates with the initial conversion of propane and the catalytic activity. This indicates that the lattice oxygen capacity plays a crucial role in the initial activity of the catalyst in PDH reactions.

5. All promoted catalysts, including those with Ce, In, La, and Fe promoters, exhibit higher initial propane consumption rates and improved propylene generation rates compared to the base Pt/SSF sample. This suggests that the introduction of promoters enhances the activity of the Pt-based catalysts in PDH reactions.

6. The In-promoted catalyst InPt/SSF demonstrates an excellent ability to improve the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. Its application in the activation of light alkanes holds great potential due to its superior performance in terms of stability and propylene selectivity.

1. 阶梯型沸石（如SBA-15）通过提供更大的表面积和更易于访问的孔隙空间，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强了丙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点可达性。主要类型包括介孔和大孔沸石。合成方法通常涉及水热合成、溶胶-凝胶过程和模板导向组装。与传统沸石相比，阶梯型沸石在PDH反应中提供了增强的可达性和更好的选择性，这是由于其定制的孔结构和表面化学性质。

2. 将Ce、In、La、Fe等促进剂引入到Pt/SSF催化剂中，显著影响其可还原性、基本性、Pt表面积、金属Pt颗粒稳定性以及焦炭沉积等特性。这些变化决定了丙烷脱氢反应的催化活性和稳定性。例如，In有助于形成更多的表面Pt氧化物，并在反应条件下促进其还原和金属Pt颗粒的稳定化，从而增强丙烯选择性和稳定性。

3. 在In作为促进剂的情况下，Pt/SSF催化剂形成了更多的表面Pt氧化物。此外，In促进了这些氧化物的还原并稳定了金属Pt颗粒。这导致了Pt丰富的表面形成，这对于提高Pt/SSF催化剂在PDH反应中的催化稳定性具有益处。

4. 含有In作为促进剂的FePt/SSF催化剂涉及最多的晶格氧，这与丙烷初始转化率和催化剂活性相关联。这表明晶格氧容量在PDH反应中对催化剂的初始活性起着关键作用。

5. 包含Ce、In、La、Fe促进剂的所有催化剂均表现出比基Pt/SSF样品更高的初始丙烷消耗速率和改进的丙烯生成速率。这表明促进剂的引入增强了基于Pt的催化剂在PDH反应中的活性。

6. InPt/SSF催化剂显示出卓越的催化稳定性改善能力，在丙烷脱氢反应中。其在轻烷烃活化方面的应用潜力巨大，特别是考虑到其出色的稳定性和丙烯选择性。
