[1] "Sn was doped into SBA-15, and the resulting material was further applied as support (SSF) to disperse the active phases Pt."
[2] "The introduction of promotors did not change significantly the porous property but affected dramatically the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, etc., which finally acted differently in determining the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene and the catalytic stability."
[3] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."
[4] "On the other hand, it could be easily found that the sintering of active metallic Pt and the coke deposition were still the main reasons responsible for the catalytic deactivation."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. The micropores allow for the confinement of molecules, increasing the likelihood of collisions and reactions, while the mesopores/macropores facilitate diffusion and transport of molecules between the micropores. This combination improves the overall efficiency of the PDH reactions.

2. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include SBA-15, MCM-41, and silicalite-1. These materials are synthesized using hydrothermal methods, typically involving the sol-gel process or template-directed self-assembly. They are known for their well-defined pore structures and high surface areas, which contribute to their enhanced catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

3. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites like SBA-15 typically involves the use of surfactants or polymers as templates to create a hierarchical structure with a combination of micropores and mesopores. This results in materials with superior properties compared to traditional zeolites, such as increased surface area, tunable pore sizes, and enhanced stability, leading to improved performance in PDH reactions.

4. The sintering of active metallic Pt and the coke deposition remain the primary reasons for catalytic deactivation in PDH reactions. Hierarchical zeolites mitigate these issues by providing a more stable environment for the Pt catalyst, reducing the risk of sintering and enhancing the resistance to coke formation, thereby improving the overall catalytic stability.

1. 分级沸石通过提供多个反应物和产物通道来增强丙烷脱氢反应的可接近性，结合了微孔和介孔/大孔。微孔允许分子的限制，增加了碰撞和反应的可能性，而介孔/大孔则促进分子在微孔之间的扩散和运输。这种组合提高了PDH反应的整体效率。

2. 主要的分级沸石类型包括SBA-15、MCM-41和硅酸铝。这些材料通过水热方法合成，通常涉及溶胶-凝胶过程或模板导向自组装。它们以其定义明确的孔结构和高比表面积而闻名，这些特性对PDH反应的催化性能有显著影响。

3. SBA-15等分级沸石的合成通常使用表面活性剂或聚合物作为模板来创建具有微孔和介孔的层次结构。这导致了比传统沸石更稳定的材料，具有更高的比表面积、可调的孔径大小以及增强的稳定性，从而改善了PDH反应的催化性能。

4. 在PDH反应中，活性金属Pt的烧结和焦炭沉积仍然是催化剂失活的主要原因。分级沸石通过提供一个更稳定的环境来减轻这些问题，减少Pt催化剂的烧结风险，并增强其对焦炭形成的抵抗力，从而提高整体催化稳定性。
