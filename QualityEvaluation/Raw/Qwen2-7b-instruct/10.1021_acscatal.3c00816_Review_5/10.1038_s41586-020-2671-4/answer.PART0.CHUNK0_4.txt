<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support.</p>
<p>This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.</p>
<p>The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a pathway for reactants to enter the zeolite pores and reach the metal nanoparticles, while also allowing products to easily exit the pores. This structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by facilitating better dispersion of metal nanoparticles and enhancing the diffusion of reactants and products.</p>
<p>The main types of hierarchical zeolites are those with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores. They are synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, which helps to create the hierarchical structure during the synthesis process.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites, characterized by ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, enhance the accessibility of PDH reactions by providing a pathway for reactants to enter the zeolite pores and reach the metal nanoparticles, while also enabling the easy exit of products. This structure significantly improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by facilitating better dispersion of metal nanoparticles and enhancing the diffusion of reactants and products. The synthesis of these hierarchical zeolites typically involves a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent during the synthesis process.
