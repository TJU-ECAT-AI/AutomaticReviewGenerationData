[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
[2] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
[3] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
[4] "The PtREE/zeolite sample shown in Fig. 1 was prepared using a degallated zeolite containing a large number of silanol nest sites. The PtREE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support."
[5] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion pathways and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. These materials are synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, resulting in ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores. The inclusion of rare-earth elements (La and Y) improves the dispersion of Pt catalysts and stabilizes them in small nanoparticles through strong metal-support interactions. The incorporation of Pt and REEs into the mesoporous zeolite is achieved through co-impregnation, followed by heat treatments under O2 and H2 flows. The presence of silanol nest sites in the degallated zeolite facilitates the formation of Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles, enhancing the catalytic performance. The high performance of Pt-REE alloy catalysts supported on mesoporous zeolites can be attributed to the role of surface silanol nests in enabling atomistic alloying of REEs into Pt nanoparticles.

分层沸石通过提供易于反应物和产物扩散的通道以及在微孔中的高金属纳米粒子分散，结合了微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料通过使用多胺表面活性剂作为结构导向剂进行合成，产生超薄沸石骨架和三维互联介孔。将镧和钇等稀土元素（La和Y）加入其中可以改善铂催化剂的分散，并通过与铂之间的强金属支持相互作用稳定其形成小纳米颗粒。通过共浸渍铂和REE的水溶液，然后在氧气流下加热至350°C，随后在氢气流下加热至700°C，实现了铂和REE在沸石中的掺入。在去镓的沸石中存在大量的硅醇巢位点，有助于形成铂-REE合金纳米颗粒。沸石上铂-REE合金催化剂的高性能可以归因于表面硅醇巢位在使REE原子级合金化进入铂纳米颗粒中所起的关键作用。
