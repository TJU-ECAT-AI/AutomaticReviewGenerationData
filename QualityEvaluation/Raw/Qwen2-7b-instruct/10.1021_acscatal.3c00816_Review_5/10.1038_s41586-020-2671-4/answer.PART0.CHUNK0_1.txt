[1] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s."
[2] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores."
[3] "The same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
[4] "The catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."
[5] "The mesoporous zeolite can effectively activate the hard-to-reduce REEs (that is, REEs with low reduction potential) to overcome the energy hurdle by putting them into single atomic species, which facilitates the formation of alloy nanoparticles."

1. The industrial PDH process uses PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina, a method discovered in the early 1990s.
2. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by facilitating both reactant and product diffusion and providing high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores.
3. The same preparation strategy for Pt alloy catalysts incorporates a significant amount of the second metal, resulting in high catalytic activity and selectivity in CO oxidation in hydrogen for the PtCo alloy.
4. The addition of lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) increases the catalytic lifetime of the Pt catalyst more than tenfold.
5. Mesoporous zeolites can effectively activate hard-to-reduce rare earth elements (REEs) to facilitate the formation of alloy nanoparticles by converting them into single atomic species.

1. 工业PDH过程使用包含在多孔氧化铝上的PtSn双金属催化剂，该方法在20世纪90年代初被发现。
2. 分级沸石通过促进反应物和产物扩散以及在介孔中提供高金属纳米粒子分散来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可访问性。
3. 同样的制备策略对于Pt合金催化剂可以显著增加第二种金属的含量，在PtCo合金的情况下，这导致在氢中的CO选择性氧化表现出高催化活性和选择性。
4. 添加镧（La）和钇（Y）可以使Pt催化剂的催化寿命增加超过十倍。
5. 介孔沸石可以通过将难以还原的稀有地球元素（REE）转换为单原子物种来有效地激活它们，从而促进合金纳米颗粒的形成。
