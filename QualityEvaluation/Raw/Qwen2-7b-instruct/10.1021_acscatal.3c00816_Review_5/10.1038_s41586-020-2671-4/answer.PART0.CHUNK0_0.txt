1. The method to produce other metal alloys using Pt-group metals and rare-earth elements (REEs) can be expanded upon, as demonstrated by the PtCe intermetallic alloy nanoparticle catalyst in Figure 2 and Extended Data Figure 8. For practical use of zeolite-supported catalysts, it is crucial to develop an efficient regeneration method, like the oxychlorination process utilized for PtSn/alumina.

2. The preparation technique used to create Pt alloy catalysts includes incorporating an unusually high proportion of the secondary metal, which was notably effective in the PtCo alloy, enhancing its catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen.

3. The introduction of REEs was anticipated to boost the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst because of the strong metal-support interaction effect. Surprisingly, the addition of La and Y significantly increased the catalyst's lifetime by over tenfold.

4. The Pt and REEs were supported on the mz and mz-deGa zeolites using the incipient wetness impregnation technique. A similar process was applied during the synthesis of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate.

5. The PtCo catalysts were supported onto the mz-deGa, mz, and alumina supports following a procedure akin to that used for the supported PtREE catalysts for the PROX tests.

1. 利用铂族金属和稀土元素（REE）生产其他金属合金的方法可以扩展，如图2和扩展数据图8中PtCe互溶合金纳米颗粒催化剂所示。对于佐料支持催化剂的实际应用，开发一种高效的再生方法至关重要，如用于PtSn/alumina的氧氯化过程。

2. 制备Pt合金催化剂的技术包括将大量的第二种金属整合进去，这在PtCo合金中尤其有效，提高了其在氢气中的二氧化碳选择性氧化活性和选择性。

3. 预期添加REEs能够提高Pt/佐料催化剂的初始PDH活性，因为这是由于强金属-支撑相互作用效应。令人惊讶的是，La和Y的添加使催化剂的寿命增加了十倍以上。

4. 使用浸渍湿法将Pt和REEs支持在mz和mz-deGa佐料上。与合成多孔MFI高岭石相似的过程也被应用。

5. 在PROX测试中，PtCo催化剂被支持在mz-deGa、mz和氧化铝支持物上，采用类似于支持PtREE催化剂的程序。
