[4] "Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."
[5] "The Pt and REEs were supported on the mz and mz-deGa zeolites by the incipient wetness impregnation technique."
[6] "The same procedure was used as for the mesoporous MFI gallosilicate."

1. The method to produce other metal alloys using Pt-group metals and rare-earth elements (REEs) can be expanded upon, as demonstrated by the PtCe intermetallic alloy nanoparticle catalyst in Figure 2 and Extended Data Figure 8. For practical use of zeolite-supported catalysts, it is crucial to develop an efficient regeneration method, like the oxychlorination process utilized for PtSn/alumina.

2. The preparation technique used to create Pt alloy catalysts includes incorporating an unusually high proportion of the secondary metal, which was notably effective in the PtCo alloy, enhancing its catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen.

3. The introduction of REEs was anticipated to boost the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst because of the strong metal-support interaction effect. Surprisingly, the addition of La and Y significantly increased the catalyst's lifetime by over tenfold.

4. The Pt and REEs were supported on the mz and mz-deGa zeolites using the incipient wetness impregnation technique. A similar process was applied during the synthesis of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate.

5. The PtCo catalysts were supported onto the mz-deGa, mz, and alumina supports following a procedure akin to that used for the supported PtREE catalysts for the PROX tests.

The presence of silanol nest sites in the degallated zeolite facilitates the formation of Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles, enhancing the catalytic performance. The high performance of Pt-REE alloy catalysts supported on mesoporous zeolites can be attributed to the role of surface silanol nests in enabling atomistic alloying of REEs into Pt nanoparticles.

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion pathways and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. They are synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, which leads to a unique structure comprising ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer superior performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced reactivity pathways and improved metal dispersion.

These materials are mainly synthesized through a process that involves adding a structure-directing agent, such as a multi-ammonium surfactant, during the synthesis of the zeolite. This ensures the formation of ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which are crucial for the enhanced catalytic activity. The synthesis typically includes aging steps at elevated temperatures to facilitate the formation of the desired pore structure.

The introduction of rare-earth elements (REEs) into the hierarchical zeolite matrix allows for the formation of intermetallic compounds with platinum nanoparticles. This is facilitated by the presence of silanol nests, which are clusters of silanol groups that can stabilize single atomic REE species. These species can then be converted to metallic REEs more easily than bulk REE oxides, enabling the formation of PtREE intermetallic nanoparticles. This results in enhanced catalytic performance for PDH reactions, including increased activity, selectivity, and durability.

Hierarchical zeolites have been used in PDH reactions in conjunction with other metals such as zinc (PtZn) and tin (PtSn), demonstrating their versatility in catalytic applications. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. The use of hierarchical zeolites, particularly those with surface silanol nests, circumvents this issue by facilitating the formation of PtREE intermetallic nanoparticles.

These findings suggest that hierarchical zeolites, especially those with optimized silanol nest concentrations, can significantly improve the performance of PDH catalysts. The unique pore architecture and the ability to control the formation of intermetallic compounds through the presence of silanol nests are key factors in achieving this enhanced catalytic performance. The use of these materials opens up new opportunities for developing more efficient and durable PDH catalysts.

这些材料主要是通过在合成沸石时添加结构导向剂，如多季铵表面活性剂，来合成的。这确保了形成超薄沸石框架和互联微孔的形成，这对于增强反应物和产物扩散路径以及金属纳米颗粒在微孔中的分散至关重要。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在PDH反应中表现出更优越的性能，主要是由于它们增强了活性路径并提高了金属分散性。

引入稀土元素（REE）到层级沸石矩阵中允许铂纳米颗粒形成互金属化合物。这得益于表面硅醇巢的存在，它们是相邻硅醇基团形成的簇，可以稳定单原子REE物种。这些物种可以比块状REE氧化物更容易地转化为金属REE，从而形成PtREE互金属纳米颗粒。这导致PDH反应催化性能的显著提高，包括活动性、选择性和耐用性的增加。

层级沸石已被用于与锌（PtZn）和锡（PtSn）等其他金属一起进行PDH反应，表明它们在催化应用中的多功能性。然而，通过氢气还原路线形成Pt与稀土元素之间的合金是一个挑战，因为稀土元素氧化物的化学势很低。通过层级沸石，尤其是具有表面硅醇巢的沸石，可以绕过这个问题，通过使硅醇巢的存在来促进PtREE互金属纳米颗粒的形成。

这些发现表明，通过优化硅醇巢浓度的层级沸石可以显着改善PDH催化剂的性能。独特的孔结构和通过存在硅醇巢控制形成互金属化合物的能力是实现这种增强催化性能的关键因素。使用这些材料为开发更高效和持久的PDH催化剂提供了新的机会。
