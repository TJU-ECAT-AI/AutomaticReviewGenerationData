<quotes>
The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species.
For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

1. The hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, which allows for better diffusion of reactants and products. These materials typically include silicalite-1 and commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 analogues. They are synthesized through various methods, including hydrothermal synthesis and ion-exchange techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by increasing propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

1. 分级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，提高了PDH反应的可接近性，允许更好的反应物和产物扩散。这些材料通常包括硅酸盐-1和商用KCrOx/Al2O3的类似物。它们通过多种方法合成，包括水热合成和离子交换技术。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提高丙烯产率来改善PDH反应性能，同时保持相似的丙烯选择性。

2. The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity. This indicates that the supported ZnOx species have significantly improved the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation to propene compared to traditional Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction, which increases the contact between reactants and catalyst sites. These materials are mainly categorized into two types: natural and synthetic. Natural zeolites are formed through geological processes, while synthetic zeolites are created in laboratories using chemical reactions. The synthesis methods for these materials typically involve hydrothermal treatments or sol-gel processes. Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore structures, which optimize the diffusion of reactants and products.

层级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可访问性，通过提供更大的表面积来促进反应物与催化剂位点的接触。这些材料主要分为两类：天然和合成。天然沸石是通过地质过程形成的，而合成沸石是在实验室中通过化学反应制成的。这些材料的合成方法通常包括水热处理或溶胶-凝胶过程。层级沸石在性能上优于传统沸石，因为它们优化了反应物和产物的扩散，通过其改进的孔结构提高了PDH反应的效率。

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction to occur, which increases the contact between reactants and the catalyst, thus improving the efficiency of the PDH process. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized through various methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and microwave-assisted synthesis. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better pore structure and higher specific surface area, leading to increased catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and its commercial analogue, KCrOx/Al2O3, were tested under industrially relevant conditions to benchmark their performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst demonstrated higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity compared to the commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.
