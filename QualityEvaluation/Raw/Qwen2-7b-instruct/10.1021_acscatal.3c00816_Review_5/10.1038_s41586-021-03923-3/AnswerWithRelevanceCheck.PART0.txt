          [1] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
          [2] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."
          [3] "For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction, which increases the contact between reactants and catalyst sites. These materials are mainly categorized into two types: natural and synthetic. Natural zeolites are formed through geological processes, while synthetic zeolites are created in laboratories using chemical reactions. The synthesis methods for these materials typically involve hydrothermal treatments or sol-gel processes. Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore structures, which optimize the diffusion of reactants and products.

          层级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可访问性，通过提供更大的反应表面区域来促进反应物与催化剂位点的接触。这些材料主要分为两类：天然和合成。天然沸石是通过地质过程形成的，而合成沸石是在实验室中通过化学反应制成的。这些材料的合成方法通常包括水热处理或溶胶-凝胶过程。层级沸石在性能上优于传统沸石，因为它们优化了反应物和产物的扩散，通过其改进的孔结构提高了PDH反应的效率。

          Developed catalysts reveal about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity. This indicates that the supported ZnOx species have significantly improved the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation to propene compared to traditional Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts.
