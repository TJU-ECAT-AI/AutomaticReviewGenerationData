[1] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
[2] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."
[3] "For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction to occur, which increases the contact between reactants and the catalyst, thus improving the efficiency of the PDH process. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized through various methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and microwave-assisted synthesis. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better pore structure and higher specific surface area, leading to increased catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and its commercial analogue, KCrOx/Al2O3, were tested under industrially relevant conditions to benchmark their performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst demonstrated higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity compared to the commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

1. 分级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性，提供更大的反应表面区域，增加了反应物与催化剂之间的接触，从而提高了PDH过程的效率。主要类型的分级沸石包括介孔和大孔沸石，这些材料通过模板导向合成、溶胶-凝胶过程和微波辅助合成等方法进行合成。与传统沸石相比，这些材料提供了更好的孔结构和更高的比表面积，导致催化活性和选择性的增加。

2. 开发的ZnOsilicalite-1及其商业类比KCrOx/Al2O3在工业相关条件下进行了测试以评估其性能。ZnOsilicalite-1催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中展示了更高的丙烯产率，同时保持了与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂相似的丙烯选择性。
