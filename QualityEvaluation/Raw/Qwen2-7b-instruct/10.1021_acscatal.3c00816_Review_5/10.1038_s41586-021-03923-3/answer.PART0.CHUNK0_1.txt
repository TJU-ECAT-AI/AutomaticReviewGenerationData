The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9.
Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species.
For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream.
The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

1. The hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, which allows for better diffusion of reactants and products. These materials typically include silicalite-1 and commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 analogues. They are synthesized through various methods, including hydrothermal synthesis and ion-exchange techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by increasing propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

1. 分级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，提高了PDH反应的可接近性，允许更好的反应物和产物扩散。这些材料通常包括硅酸盐-1和商用KCrOx/Al2O3的类似物。它们通过多种方法合成，包括水热合成和离子交换技术。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提高丙烯产率来改善PDH反应性能，同时保持相似的丙烯选择性。

2. The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity. This indicates that the supported ZnOx species have significantly improved the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation to propene compared to traditional Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts.
