• "CoOx confined in the SiBeta zeolite by connecting with silanols was prepared by a procedure comprising dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600 C in air."
• "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
• "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The specific synthesis method involves dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600 C in air. These materials offer a green, nonprecious, and highly effective catalyst for PDH reactions, surpassing traditional zeolites in terms of performance.
