<p>Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite is used to develop CoSiBeta catalysts. The catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance. The CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles.</p>
<p>The confined small metallic Co particles are catalytically active for PDH.</p>
<p>CoSiBeta catalysts have state-of-the-art productivity for direct dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support.</p>
<p>Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C.</p>
<p>CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods.</p>
<p>The CoSiBeta catalysts include highly dispersed metallic Co and CoO particles that are formed in ambient atmosphere.</p>
<p>The real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts.</p>
<p>Small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.</p>
