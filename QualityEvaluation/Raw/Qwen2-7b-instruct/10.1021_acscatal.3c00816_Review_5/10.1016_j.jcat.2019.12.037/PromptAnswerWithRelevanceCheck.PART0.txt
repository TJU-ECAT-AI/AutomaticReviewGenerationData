[1] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
[2] "By combining activity test and characterization results, the nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed."
[3] "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."
[4] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments likely contained single cobalt species, as detected by a series of techniques of XRD, N2 sorption, DRIFT, DR UVvis, NH3 TPD, H2 TPR, XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping."
[5] "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

1. Hierarchical zeolites, such as SiBeta, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials are synthesized by dealumination of AlBeta zeolite, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600°C in air. This process creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provides good conditions for confining the cobalt species, leading to the formation of confined cobalt species. The presence of these confined cobalt species allows for high catalytic activity and product selectivity in PDH reactions.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are SiBeta and AlBeta. The synthesis methods involve treating raw AlBeta zeolite with a specific SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in a concentrated nitric acid solution, followed by drying and calcination. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a high surface area for well-dispersed metal species, high stability under harsh reaction conditions, and an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts.

3. The performance of CoSiBeta catalysts is enhanced by the reduction of confined cobalt oxides (CoOx) to metallic cobalt (Co) particles during the PDH reaction. This results in high propylene selectivity, possibly by boosting propylene desorption. The metallic cobalt sizes play a crucial role in determining the target reactivity of the PDH reaction.

4. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst likely contained a single cobalt species, as confirmed by a series of characterization techniques. These techniques include XRD, N2 sorption, DRIFT, DR UVvis, NH3 TPD, H2 TPR, XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping. The presence of this single cobalt species contributes to the high catalytic activity and product selectivity of the catalyst.

5. The CoSiBeta catalysts offer a green and promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst with high catalytic activity and product selectivity. This work provides new insights into the active cobalt phase for the PDH reaction, offering a promising avenue for the design of low-cost, eco-friendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH.

1. 层次结构沸石，如SiBeta，通过微孔和介孔/大孔的结合，增强了PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料通过将原始AlBeta沸石处理为特定的SiO2/Al2O3比例的浓硝酸溶液，然后干燥和在空气中进行600°C的煅烧来合成。这个过程产生大量与硅醇相连的T位点，为限制钴物种提供了良好的条件，导致形成限制性钴物种。这些限制性钴物种允许在PDH反应中具有高催化活性和产品选择性。

2. 层次结构沸石的主要类型是SiBeta和AlBeta。合成方法涉及用特定的SiO2/Al2O3比例的浓硝酸溶液处理原始AlBeta沸石，然后干燥和煅烧。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供高表面积以分散金属物种、在苛刻反应条件下具有高稳定性以及根据金属催化剂周围环境变化的可调内部环境，提高了PDH反应性能。

3.PDH反应中，CoSiBeta催化剂的性能通过限制钴氧化物（CoOx）的还原到金属钴（Co）颗粒而得到增强。这导致高丙烯选择性，可能通过促进丙烯脱附。金属钴颗粒的大小在确定PDH反应目标反应性方面起着关键作用。

4. 0.5CoSiBeta催化剂很可能包含单一的钴物种，这是通过一系列表征技术确认的。这些技术包括XRD、N2吸附、DRIFT、DR UVvis、NH3 TPD、H2 TPR、XPS、TEM和EDS映射。这一单一的钴物种的存在对催化剂的高催化活性和产品选择性做出了贡献。

5. CoSiBeta催化剂提供了绿色且有前景的非贵金属脱氢催化剂，具有高催化活性和产品选择性。这项工作提供了关于PDH反应中活性钴相的新见解，为设计低成本、环保且先进的催化剂提供了有希望的方向。
