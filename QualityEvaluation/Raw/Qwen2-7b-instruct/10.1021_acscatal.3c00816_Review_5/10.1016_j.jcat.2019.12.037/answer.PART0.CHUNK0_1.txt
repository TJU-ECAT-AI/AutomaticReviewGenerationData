• "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
• "Dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600 C in air were the synthesis methods used to prepare the hierarchical zeolites."
• "The use of hierarchical zeolites improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing better accessibility and dispersion of active sites."
