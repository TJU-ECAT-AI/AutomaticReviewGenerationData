1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. They are synthesized through a process involving dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600°C in air.
2. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a propane conversion of 72% with a propylene selectivity of 92%.
3. Confined CoOx species in the SiBeta zeolite can be reduced to metallic Co particles during the PDH reaction, leading to similar catalytic performance for CoSiBeta catalysts, regardless of whether they undergo a pre-reduction treatment.

1. 分级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过分步过程制备，包括对AlBeta的去铝化、钴硝酸盐溶液的浸渍以及在空气中600°C的煅烧。
2. 0.5CoSiBeta催化剂表现出卓越的性能，实现了72%的丙烷转化率和92%的丙烯选择性。
3. SiBeta沸石中的封闭CoOx物种可以在PDH反应中被还原为金属Co颗粒，导致CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否进行预还原处理，其催化性能相似。
