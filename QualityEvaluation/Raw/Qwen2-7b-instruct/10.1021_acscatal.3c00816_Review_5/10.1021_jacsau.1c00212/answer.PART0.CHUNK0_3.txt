1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a more extensive surface area and interconnected pore system that allows for better diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with ordered macropores and those with hierarchical structures consisting of both micropores and mesopores. Synthesis methods typically involve template-directed assembly, sol-gel processes, and post-synthesis treatments such as calcination or acid treatment to introduce additional porosity. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore architecture which facilitates faster and more efficient catalytic activity.

1. 层级沸石通过提供更广泛的表面区域和连通孔隙系统，增强了PDH反应的可访问性，从而增强其性能。层级沸石的主要类型包括具有有序大孔的沸石以及由微孔和介孔组成的层级结构沸石。合成方法通常涉及模板导向组装、溶胶-凝胶过程以及后合成处理，如煅烧或酸处理，以引入额外的孔隙性。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过其增强的孔结构，可以更快速且更有效地促进催化活性。
