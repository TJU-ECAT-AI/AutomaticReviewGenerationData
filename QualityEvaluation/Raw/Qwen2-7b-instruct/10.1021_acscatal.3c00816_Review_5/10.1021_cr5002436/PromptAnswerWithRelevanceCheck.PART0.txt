<p>However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8).</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant molecules to attach, as well as shorter diffusion paths to the active sites. This improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, which often have smaller pore sizes that limit access for reactants and products. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with integrated mesopores within microporous structures and those with macropores added to the zeolite framework. Synthesis methods typically involve templating agents that guide the formation of the hierarchical structure during the zeolite synthesis process. These materials improve PDH reactions by facilitating more efficient adsorption, reaction, and desorption processes.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface area for reactions and larger pores for easy access of reactants and products. Main types include pillared zeolites and layered double hydroxides. Synthesis methods involve the use of layered double hydroxides as precursors and the introduction of metal ions to create pillared structures. These materials improve PDH reactions by enhancing the dispersion of active sites, increasing the number of accessible active sites, and promoting better control of reaction pathways. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer better stability, higher selectivity, and improved efficiency in PDH reactions.

1. The majority of the new propane dehydrogenation facilities will be constructed in China or the United States, utilizing the Catofin (Lummus) or Oleflex (UOP) technologies.

2. Various factors such as the high energy requirements of the processes, low selectivity towards specific olefins, depletion of crude oil reserves, and escalating crude oil prices are prompting the petrochemical sector to seek more affordable raw materials and more efficient conversion methods.

3. The demand for these fundamental components has grown consistently in recent years, with all major markets witnessing positive growth trends in demand and production, except for the Eurozone, due to the impacts of the recent economic downturn.

4. In addition to methane, shale gas reservoirs contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including ethane and propane, which are easily separable from the natural gas.

5. The surge in natural gas supply has led to a substantial decline in gas costs, approximately 75% lower compared to 2005 prices, rendering this shale gas highly attractive for both energy generation and use as a feedstock in the production of transportation fuels or chemicals.

6. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions highly favorable.

7. The uptick in demand, particularly from the automotive industry, along with a reduction in supply caused by the high cost of naphtha cracking, has led to steep increases in butadiene prices.

8. It was not feasible to compute the turnover frequency (TOF) due to the lack of platinum dispersion values (the ratio between the surface and internal Pt content of the catalyst nanoparticles) in most of the referenced studies included in Table 3.

[1] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
[2] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[3] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
[4] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
[5] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

How do hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, what are the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, and how do they improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites?

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pore network. This allows for better control of the reaction pathways and increased reactivity. Main types include mesoporous-zeolite hybrids, templated zeolites, and nanostructured zeolites. Synthesis methods involve modifying traditional zeolite synthesis protocols to incorporate mesopore or macropore components, often using surfactants or template molecules. These materials improve PDH reactions by increasing surface area, enhancing pore connectivity, and providing more accessible sites for the reaction intermediates. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit higher catalytic activity and selectivity, lower deactivation rates, and better stability due to the optimized pore structure.

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

To address the growing demand for light olefins and the need for more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion technologies, hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technologies have advanced, enabling the extraction of large volumes of shale gas in a cost-effective manner. This has led to a significant drop in natural gas costs by about 75% compared to 2005 prices, making shale gas a highly attractive energy source and raw material for producing transportation fuels and chemicals. The booming shale gas production in the US has transformed it into the world's lowest-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, with over 126 investment projects totaling $84 billion as of September 2013 documented by the American Chemistry Council. The abundance of relatively inexpensive natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, has prompted a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane-based operations in the US, leading to the construction of ethane crackers and the decommissioning or conversion of naphtha crackers. Shale gas deposits contain substantial quantities of natural gas liquids (NGLs) such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation, which converts propane into propylene, is largely influenced by the price gap between these two commodities, making current market conditions highly favorable. The surge in demand, especially from the automotive sector, coupled with a decline in naphtha cracking supply due to high costs, has resulted in a steep rise in butadiene prices. The abundance of cheap ethane has further driven the shift from naphtha to ethane in steam cracking processes in the US, and this trend has also led to investments in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) plants in the US, China, and Japan.

近年来，通过压裂技术的改进，大量页岩气以经济有效的方式得以开采。这导致天然气价格大幅下降，大约降低了75%，使之成为既作为能源来源又作为生产运输燃料或化学品原料的极具吸引力的选择。美国页岩气产量的繁荣使其成为世界除中东以外的最低成本化学生产国，截至2013年9月，已有超过126个总投资项目总额达840亿美元，由美国化学理事会记录。页岩气富含大量的天然气液体（NGL），包括乙烷和丙烷，这些气体很容易从天然气中分离出来。丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差，使得当前市场条件非常有利。对汽车行业的增加需求，与由于成本高昂而减少的石脑油裂解供应相结合，导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨。廉价的乙烷的丰富供应进一步推动了美国从传统石脑油基蒸汽裂解转向基于乙烷的操作，这一趋势也促使在美国、中国和日本投资新的丁烷脱氢（BDH）工厂。
