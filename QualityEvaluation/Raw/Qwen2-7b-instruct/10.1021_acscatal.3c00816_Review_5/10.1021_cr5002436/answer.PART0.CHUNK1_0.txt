[1] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MEL, BEA, and LTA. They are synthesized using a variety of methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processing, and ion exchange techniques."
[2] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. This is achieved by creating a layered structure that allows for easier access to the active sites for reactants and products."
[3] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites have improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore connectivity and larger surface area. This leads to higher conversion rates and selectivity towards olefin products."

1. 层状沸石的主要类型包括MFI、MEL、BEA和LTA。这些可以通过模板导向合成、溶胶-凝胶加工和离子交换技术等方法进行合成。

2. 层状沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这通过创建一个层状结构实现，该结构允许更容易地访问活性位点以供反应物和产物使用。

3. 相比传统的沸石，层状沸石在PDH反应中的性能更优。这是由于其增强的孔隙连通性和更大的表面积导致更高的转化率和更偏向于烯烃产品的选择性。
