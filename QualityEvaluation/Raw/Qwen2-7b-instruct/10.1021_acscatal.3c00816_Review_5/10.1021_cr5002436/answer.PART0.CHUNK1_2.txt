Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. They are synthesized through a template-directed method, followed by the removal of the template to create the hierarchical structure. Micropores enable the confinement of reactants and products, while mesopores/macropores enhance the accessibility of active sites. This combination results in better performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. Examples of these materials include SBA-1, MCM-41, and mesoporous molecular sieves.

层状沸石将微孔与介孔/大孔结合，以提高PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过模板导向法合成，随后去除模板以形成层级结构。微孔允许反应物和产物的限制，而介孔/大孔提高了活性位点的可接近性。这种组合导致PDH反应性能比传统沸石更好。这些材料的例子包括SBA-1、MCM-41和微孔分子筛。

Various techniques are utilized to synthesize hierarchical zeolites, including template-directed methods, sol-gel processes, and chemical vapor deposition. Template-directed methods involve creating a template to direct the growth of the zeolite, followed by the removal of the template. Sol-gel processes involve converting a sol (liquid) into a gel (semi-solid) and then drying it to produce the zeolite. Chemical vapor deposition employs a gas-phase reaction to deposit zeolite layers onto a substrate. These methods can be customized to generate hierarchical zeolites with varying pore sizes and architectures.

用于合成层状沸石的方法包括模板导向方法、溶胶-凝胶过程和化学气相沉积。模板导向方法涉及创建一个模板来指导沸石的生长，随后移除模板。溶胶-凝胶过程涉及将溶胶（液体）转化为凝胶（半固体），然后干燥形成沸石。化学气相沉积使用气相反应在基板上沉积沸石层。这些方法可以定制以生成具有不同孔径大小和结构的层状沸石。
