[1] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts based on these materials display an initial conversion of 18.1% with a selectivity toward propylene of 87.1% at 550 C."
[2] "Interestingly, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface area for reactions and larger pores for easy access of reactants and products. Main types include pillared zeolites and layered double hydroxides. Synthesis methods involve the use of layered double hydroxides as precursors and the introduction of metal ions to create pillared structures. These materials improve PDH reactions by enhancing the dispersion of active sites, increasing the number of accessible active sites, and promoting better control of reaction pathways. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer better stability, higher selectivity, and improved efficiency in PDH reactions.

层次型沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，增强PDH反应的可接近性，提供高比表面积以促进反应，并提供较大的孔径以方便反应物和产物的进入。主要类型包括层状双氢氧化物和插层沸石。合成方法涉及使用层状双氢氧化物作为前体并引入金属离子来创建插层结构。这些材料通过提高活性位点的分散度、增加可访问的活性位点数量以及更好地控制反应途径，改善PDH反应。与传统沸石相比，层次型沸石在PDH反应中表现出更好的稳定性、更高的选择性和改进的效率。
