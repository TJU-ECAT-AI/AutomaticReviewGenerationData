[1] "The company has a unique ability to synthesize hierarchical zeolites that combine micropores and mesopores/macropores. These materials can enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "Hierarchical zeolites are synthesized through a combination of sol-gel processing, template-directed assembly, and calcination. The synthesis methods aim to create a dual-pore system where micropores provide high surface area for adsorption and mesopores/macropores facilitate easy access to the interior of the zeolite."
[3] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore architecture. This leads to better catalytic activity and selectivity for olefin formation."
