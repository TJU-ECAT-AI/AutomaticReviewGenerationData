<p>However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8).</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant molecules to attach, as well as shorter diffusion paths to the active sites. This improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, which often have smaller pore sizes that limit access for reactants and products. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with integrated mesopores within microporous structures and those with macropores added to the zeolite framework. Synthesis methods typically involve templating agents that guide the formation of the hierarchical structure during the zeolite synthesis process. These materials improve PDH reactions by facilitating more efficient adsorption, reaction, and desorption processes.

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的表面积和更短的反应物分子到达活性位点的扩散路径来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这与传统沸石相比改进了PDH反应性能，后者往往具有较小的孔径，限制了反应物和产物的进入。层状沸石的主要类型包括在微孔结构中集成介孔的沸石和向沸石框架添加大孔的沸石。合成方法通常涉及模板剂，在合成过程中指导形成层级结构。这些材料通过促进更有效的吸附、反应和脱附过程改进了PDH反应。
