[1] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
[2] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[3] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
[4] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
[5] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

How do hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, what are the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, and how do they improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites?

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pore network. This allows for better control of the reaction pathways and increased reactivity. Main types include mesoporous-zeolite hybrids, templated zeolites, and nanostructured zeolites. Synthesis methods involve modifying traditional zeolite synthesis protocols to incorporate mesopore or macropore components, often using surfactants or template molecules. These materials improve PDH reactions by increasing surface area, enhancing pore connectivity, and providing more accessible sites for the reaction intermediates. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit higher catalytic activity and selectivity, lower deactivation rates, and better stability due to the optimized pore structure.

如何将微孔和介孔/大孔结合在层状沸石中，以增强PDH反应的可接近性？这些材料的主要类型和合成方法是什么，以及它们与传统沸石相比如何提高PDH反应性能？

层状沸石通过提供更大的比表面积和更开放的孔网络来整合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括微孔-沸石杂合物、模板沸石和纳米结构沸石。合成方法通常涉及修改传统的沸石合成过程，以引入介孔或大孔成分，经常使用表面活性剂或模板分子。这些材料通过增加比表面积、改善孔隙连通性和提供更多反应中间体可接近的位点，提高PDH反应性能。与传统沸石相比，层状沸石往往表现出更高的催化活性、选择性和更好的稳定性，这是由于优化的孔结构。
