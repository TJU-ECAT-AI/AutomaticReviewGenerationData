1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by integrating different pore sizes into a single material structure. This allows for better diffusion and reaction pathways. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MCM-41, SBA-15, and SBA-16, which are synthesized through template-directed methods such as sol-gel processes and hydrothermal treatments. These materials show improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and increased thermal stability.

1. 级联沸石通过将微孔和介孔/大孔集成到单一材料结构中，来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这允许更好的扩散和反应途径。级联沸石的主要类型包括MCM-41、SBA-15和SBA-16，这些材料是通过模板导向的方法合成的，如溶胶-凝胶过程和水热处理。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在PDH反应中的性能更优，由于其增强的比表面积、孔径分布控制以及提高的热稳定性。

2. 级联沸石的优越性能在于其整合了不同孔径大小，形成复合结构，这有助于改善扩散路径和反应通道。主要类型的级联沸石有MCM-41、SBA-15和SBA-16，它们通过模板导向的合成方法制备，例如溶胶-凝胶过程和水热处理。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在PDH反应中的表现更好，原因在于它们具有增强的比表面积、精确控制的孔径分布和更高的热稳定性。
