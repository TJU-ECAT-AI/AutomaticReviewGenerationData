Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by designing materials with a combination of small and larger pores. The main types of these materials include mesoporous-ordered mesoporous (MOM), mesoporous-silica hybrid (MSH), and ordered mesoporous silica (OMS). They are synthesized through methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel process, and polymerization. Hierarchical zeolites outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reactions because of their improved pore architecture, leading to better selectivity, activity, and stability.

层次型沸石通过设计结合微孔和介孔或大孔的材料，来增强PDH反应的可达性。这些材料的主要类型包括介孔有序介孔（MOM）、介孔硅混合物（MSH）和有序介孔硅（OMS）。它们通过模板导向合成、溶胶-凝胶过程和聚合方法等进行合成。与传统沸石相比，层次型沸石在PDH反应中表现出更好的选择性、活性和稳定性，这是由于其改进的孔结构。
