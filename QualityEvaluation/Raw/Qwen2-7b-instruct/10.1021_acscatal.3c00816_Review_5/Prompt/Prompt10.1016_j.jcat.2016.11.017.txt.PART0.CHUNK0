Propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by gallosilicate MFI zeolites with perturbed acidity Highlights • Gallosilicate MFI catalysts were prepared via the addition of MPS (3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane). • Acid site distributions of the gallosilicate MFI catalysts were analyzed. • The gallosilicate MFI catalysts made via the MPS addition show enhanced Lewis acidity. • Addition of MPS improves both propane conversion rate and propylene selectivity.
Abstract The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) behavior of gallosilicate MFI catalysts synthesized in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) is investigated. MPS addition to the zeolite synthesis gel results in gallosilicate molecular sieves with reduced Brnsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity, as shown by combined NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), isopropylamine (IPA) TPD and IR analysis of pyridine-loaded catalysts. In particular, the gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared using MPS provide a significant concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which are important in controlling the selectivity of PDH. Enhanced PDH performance with higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products are obtained from the catalysts synthesized with MPS. The gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS are compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, and the gallosilicate materials have a lower rate of deactivation (>50% lower) but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (Ga-MFI: 75%; Chromia-Alumina: 85%).

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of valuable polymers such as poly(propylene) and chemicals such as acrylonitrile and 2-propanol. The production of propylene from catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is carried out commercially by the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] and the Oleflex process from UOP [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] . The Catofin process uses a Cr-based catalyst in multiple parallel fixed bed reactors, while the Oleflex process uses a Pt-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor [14] ,[15] . Both processes inevitably undergo rapid catalyst deactivation. PDH processes have received renewed attention in recent years, especially in North America and the Middle East, due to abundant supplies of propane, and there are renewed efforts aimed at discovering new PDH catalysts or improving the stability, activity, and selectivity of known PDH catalysts. Propane feedstocks can be also applied in propane aromatization processes to produce benzene, toluene, and xylene. Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] . Ga-containing zeolites synthesized by impregnation or ion-exchange into aluminosilicate H-ZSM-5 have been extensively studied [20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] . Gallosilicate MFI can also be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga in the MFI zeolite framework [32] ,[33] , since Ga can be easily incorporated in the MFI framework.
In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24] . They also suggested that Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 was better than the pure gallosilicate for propane aromatization. However, other studies have reported that H-gallosilicate showed higher propane aromatization selectivities than Ga ion-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5 [34] ,[35] ,[36] . A reaction mechanism of propane aromatization using Ga loaded HZSM-5 was suggested by Giannetto et al.
[37] . In this pathway, propane is first protonated on Brnsted acid sites where it undergoes either a dehydrogenation or a cracking step. A carbenium ion intermediate formed by the dehydrogenation pathway is then converted into propylene, followed by oligomerization and cyclization to aromatics at the Brnsted acid sites. In propane aromatization, PDH is a primary step, as discussed in detail by Meriaudeau and Naccache [23] ,[38] . They proposed a bifunctional mechanism during the PDH step when both Ga oxide species (Ga2O3) and Brnsted acid sites in the MFI pores are present. The strength of the Brnsted acid sites depends on the types of heteroatoms in the framework, and it is known that bridged framework Ga provides lower acidity than Al [39] . It has been suggested that the Lewis acid sites are related to positively charged oxide clusters in zeolite pore structures, normally extra-framework species [39] . During the synthesis of gallosilicate molecular sieves, the trivalent Ga3+ species not incorporated in the framework remain in the zeolite channels as highly dispersed oxide species [40] . Extra-framework Ga species can also be formed by degalliation of framework Ga, and the role of these species on PDH has been discussed [33] ,[37] ,[40] ,[41] ,[42] ,[43] . Choudhary et al. reported the formation of extra-framework Ga by heat treatment and suggested that extra-framework Ga should be the main active site for PDH whereas framework Ga species were much less active [42] ,[43] . The relation between propane conversion and propylene/aromatic selectivity was studied by Guisnet et al. where high propylene selectivities (>70%) were observed at low conversion levels (<5%). At high conversions (>20%), there was more than 50% selectivity to aromatics [44] . Although the aforementioned studies assumed that the extra-framework Ga species were present in the zeolite pores, Ga oxide domains have also been found on the outer surface of zeolites upon calcination, with the oxide clusters being 310 nm in size [45] .Although extra-framework Ga species are considered to be the main active sites for PDH [37] ,[42] ,[43] ,[46] , direct characterization of these sites can be challenging. For instance, it is difficult to detect small amounts of extra-framework Ga species by Ga-NMR due to strong quadrupolar effects since the sites are mainly in low-symmetry environments [40] ,[47] ,[48] ,[49] . There have been several attempts to investigate the presence of extra-framework Ga species by temperature programmed desorption techniques, which confirmed their strong Lewis acidic properties [22] ,[31] ,[50] ,[51] . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has also been used for characterization of acid sites in Ga-MFI [27] ,[31] ,[32] ,[48] ,[52] ,[53] ,[54] . Otero Aren et al. studied the Brnsted acid IR band associated with framework Ga in the hydroxyl stretching region and showed its decreased intensity with increased preheating temperature [52] . Rodrigues et al. reported the presence of strong Lewis acid sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 as demonstrated by adsorbed pyridine that remained even at high temperatures (673 K) [31] . The authors suggested that the highly dispersed Ga species would be related to the strong Lewis acid sites.From the above discussion, it is evident that most of the previous work on propane conversion in Ga-containing MFI catalysts has focused on maximizing aromatic selectivity. Several reports have discussed the initial PDH step in the propane aromatization sequence, but only at low propane conversions. For instance, Meriaudeau et al. carried out propane dehydrogenation at low conversions (<1%) using HZSM-5 and gallosilicate [40] . Hart et al. focused on preparation of selective dehydrogenation catalysts by Ga and in addition to H-ZSM-5 with few or no zeolite protonic sites [55] . Ga-modified MFI catalysts have not been widely studied for PDH due to the low propylene selectivities observed at high conversions. Here, we report a synthesis method that creates Ga Lewis acid sites in aluminum-free, gallosilicate MFI without post-treatments such as Ga impregnation, ion-exchange or heat treatment. Specifically, 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as a functional silane during the gallosilicate MFI zeolite synthesis. Previously, MPS has been used to incorporate metal and metal sulfide clusters such as Pt, Rh, Ag, and CdS in MFI, SOD, GIS and LTA zeolite channels [56] ,[57] ,[58] . It was proposed that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage. At the same time, the thiol group on the 3-mercaptopropyl moiety interacts with metallic ions (such as Pt2+ or Cd2+) in the zeolite synthesis solution (or gel), thereby facilitating their occlusion in the zeolite pores during crystallization. We report a detailed structural and catalytic (PDH) characterization of Ga-MFI catalysts prepared by this technique, based upon the hypothesis that the altered mechanisms of Ga incorporation induced by the addition of MPS would lead to a different acid site profiles and catalytic behavior. In this regard, the new gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared by MPS addition are shown (via FTIR characterization of pyridine adsorption as well as temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and isopropylamine) to possess lower Brnsted acid site concentrations and enhanced Lewis acid site concentrations compared to the catalyst prepared in the conventional way, without MPS addition. These catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS give higher propylene selectivities and enhanced propane conversion rates at a fixed propylene conversion level.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalysts prepared and used in this study are listed in Table 1 . All samples were calcined at 823 K for 10 h prior to use as catalysts. Details of their preparation are described below.
Table 1. List of catalysts used in this work. All catalysts were calcined at 823 K for 10 h.
Catalyst Type As-synthesized MPS/Ga Post treatment MG05 MPS-Gallosilicate TPA-Gallosilicate 0.54 None MG11 MPS-Gallosilicate TPA-Gallosilicate 1.1 None MG16 MPS-Gallosilicate TPA-Gallosilicate 1.6 None MG0 Gallosilicate TPA-Gallosilicate No MPS addition None GS Ga/pure-silica MFI TPA-silica MFI No MPS addition Ga impregnation Gallosilicate MFI with MPS (MG05, MG11, MG16): MPS-Ga MFI was prepared based on a typical hydrothermal zeolite MFI synthesis with the additions of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane precursor (MPS, 95%, SigmaAldrich) and Ga nitrate as a metal source. First, 10.2 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98% reagent grade, SigmaAldrich) was added to 16 g of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 1 M SigmaAldrich) solution with 27 g of DI water, followed by stirring overnight. Then, MPS was added to the solution and stirred for 3 h. Subsequently, 0.5 g Ga nitrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, 99.9%, SigmaAldrich) was added and the mixture was kept stirring for an additional 3 h. The final molar composition was 1 SiO2:0.32 TPAOH:45.4 DI water, with the MPS amount adjusted to achieve different MPS/Ga ratios. Three gallosilicates were synthesized, namely MG05, MG11, and MG16 for which MPS/Ga ratios in the synthesis gel were 0.54, 1.1 and 1.6 respectively. The solution was heated at 423 K for 4 days in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The obtained zeolite crystals were washed with DI water, recovered by centrifugation, and dried overnight at 343 K, followed by calcination at 823 K for 10 h under static air conditions with a heating rate of 1.5 K/min.
Gallosilicate MFI without MPS (MG0): For a comparison, another type of gallosilicate MFI with no addition of MPS (MG0) was also prepared by the same method as MPS-Ga MFI but without the MPS addition step.
Ga impregnated pure-silica MFI (Ga/pure-silica MFI, GS): Ga impregnated into the pure-silica MFI zeolite was also prepared. Pure-silica MFI was synthesized with the same synthesis method as MPS-gallosilicate MFI without addition of Ga nitrate and MPS. Then Ga impregnated pure-silica MFI was prepared by wet impregnation of Ga nitrate in ethanol solution followed by drying in a rotary evaporator and calcination under the conditions noted above.
Chromia-alumina: For a comparison with Cr catalyst similar to those applied commercially, a Na-doped chromia-on-alumina catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a composition of 20 wt.% Cr and 1 wt.% Na. A solution of Cr (III) oxide (Cr2O3, 98%, SigmaAldrich) was dropped onto an alumina (Al2O3, 98%, Sasol) support, followed by drying overnight at 383 K and calcination at 773 K for 30 h. Prior to loading the Cr onto the support, a Na nitrate (NaNO3, 99.0%, SigmaAldrich) solution was added dropwise to the alumina support and dried.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out with a PANalytical XPert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan step size of 0.0167 in a 2θ range of 550. The shape and size of the particles were characterized with a Hitachi SU8010 cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The surface area, micro- and meso-pore volumes were obtained from N2-physisorption measurements at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The samples were degassed at 473 K for 12 h and free space analysis was performed using He prior to N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements for more accurate micropore analysis. The samples were again degassed at 473 K to remove entrapped He before micropore analysis. The strength and concentration of the acid sites were determined by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) in an U-shaped fixed bed reactor using a Micromeritics Autochem II. The sample (about 0.11 g, 212400 μm pellet size) was preheated at 773 K for 1 h followed by NH3 injection at 373 K and holding for 1 h. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 25 mL STP/min. The temperature was then elevated to 873 K at a ramping rate of 10 K/min and the desorbed NH3 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The TCD was pre-calibrated with known concentrations of NH3. The concentration of Brnsted acid sites was also measured by temperature-programmed desorption of isopropylamine (IPA-TPD) [59] ,[60] ,[61] . A sample (0.1 g) was loaded in a fixed bed and activated at 773 K for 3 h with 100 mL/min of N2 flow to remove remaining water. After cooling to 373 K, 50 μL of IPA was introduced into the N2 carrier gas flow followed by overnight continuous N2 flow to remove physisorbed IPA. Then, the TPD measurements were carried out at a heating rate of 10 K/min and the concentration of desorbed propylene resulting from decomposed from IPA on the Brnsted acid sites was recorded using Pfeiffer Vacuum mass spectrometer (MS), which was also pre-calibrated with known concentrations of propylene. Elemental analysis for Ga and Si content was carried out by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ALS Environmental, AZ) to ascertain the composition of each catalyst sample. For the materials synthesized in the presence of MPS, analysis for S was also completed by combustion at 1573 K followed by infrared spectroscopy detection (ALS Environmental, AZ). Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of 29Si and 71Ga were obtained on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer at a sample spinning speed 10 kHz. The 29Si NMR spectra were referenced with respect to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid at 0 ppm. For the 71Ga NMR spectra, aqueous Ga(NO3)3 solution at 0 ppm was used for calibration. UVVis spectra were measured using a Cary 5000 UVVisNIR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). Powder zeolite samples were added to the sample holder after grinding using a mortar and pestle. The UVvis absorption spectra were measured in the wavelength range between 200 and 800 nm, with a resolution of 1 nm.
The concentrations and ratios of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites were estimated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of samples containing adsorbed pyridine on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 8700 spectrometer. The catalysts were activated at 773 K under vacuum for 6 h. A background spectrum was measured after cooling down to 423 K and then pyridine was admitted to the catalyst at the same temperature. The FT-IR spectra of hydroxyl stretching region were also obtained before dosing of pyridine. The pyridine was adsorbed for 1 h to allow equilibration, and the physisorbed pyridine was removed under vacuum at 106 mbar overnight. The FT-IR spectra of the pyridine adsorbed samples were measured at 423 K after evacuation at different temperatures, specifically 423, 523, 623, and 723 K.
2.4. Catalytic measurements
Catalytic PDH was performed at 873 K under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (212400 μm pellet size) was placed in an U-shaped quartz tube fixed bed reactor (3 mm inner diameter) and heated under N2 (UHP grade, Airgas) flow to the reaction temperature in a fluidized sand bath furnace (Techne FB-08). The concentration of C3H8 in the feed was 5% with the balance N2. The catalyst bed was fixed between two pieces of quartz wool and the amounts of each catalyst sample were adjusted for similar conversion level (7%). Hence the lengths of catalyst bed were varied from 0.3 to 1 cm. The total feed flow rate was 20 mL STP/min. Since all the catalyst samples were pelletized and sieved, a similar level of external mass transfer resistance, if any, is expected at the same gas flow velocity. Also effects of internal mass transfer are not suggested to be significant using the employed experimental conditions (
