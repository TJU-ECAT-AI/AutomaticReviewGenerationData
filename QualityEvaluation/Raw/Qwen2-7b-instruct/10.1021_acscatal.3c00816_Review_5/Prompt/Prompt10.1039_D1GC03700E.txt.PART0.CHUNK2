Chen et al. reported that nickel molybdates were active for ODH-O2 and in particular the α-NiMoO4 phase exhibited an enhanced yield compared to NiO and β-NiMoO4.224 Physical grinding of Mo and Ni precursors also led to the absence of NiO in α-NiMoO4 when compared to the analogous co-precipitation technique. It was shown that NiMoO4 had enhanced ODH-O2 performance when comparing mesoporous to bulk catalysts, but only due to the enhanced number of active sites related to the increased surface area, and not the improved mass transfer properties that usually accompany mesoporosity.225 The mesoporous catalysts had a lower specific productivity due to the loss of MoO3 from the surface of the catalysts during synthesis. This confirmed that MoO3 exhibits favourable activity to NiMoO4 for the ODH-O2 reaction (Table 10, entry 7).NiO has been found to be detrimental to ODH-O2 selectivity, favouring overoxidation products. Nb was found to be a superior dopant for NiO based catalysts, due to a reduction in the surface concentration of electrophilic O species and increased surface acidity. However, propene was still not the major product over NiO at around 10% conversion,226 suggesting that NiO-based catalysts are limited in their application for ODH-O2. In comparison to Nb-NiO catalysts, α-NiMoO4 showed a selectivity of 75% at roughly 10% conversion, with propene being the major product at similar conversions to Nb-NiO. The NiO-polyoxometalates have been shown to stabilise the adsorbed oxygen at the surface, which would limit overoxidation,227 leading to the conclusion that NiO oxygen is too labile to achieve a high selectivity. When undertaking surface polymeric phosphate modification of NiO nanoparticles (NiO-SPP), an increase in selectivity of 23 times for NiO-SPP's at isoconversion was shown (Table 10, entry 5).228 This is due to the polymeric phosphates weaker interaction with propene when compared to NiO nanoparticles, leading to a higher desorption rate and therefore higher selectivity.CeO2 was found to be a selective catalyst when HCl was added to the gas feed with O2.229 O2 was hypothesised to have filled the oxygen vacancies at the surface, forming O22 species, which mediated the oxidation of Cl to Cl radicals and resulted in high conversion and selectivity to propene. Once again, radical driven routes showed a high selectivity of 72% and conversion of 52% when the CeO2 was combined with 8 wt% NiO as NiO was shown to enhance the Cl surface coverage which in turn enhanced the route to selective conversion of propane (Table 10, entry 9). Ni was confirmed to increase oxygen vacancies when incorporated into the CeO2 lattice, leading to an increase in active sites.230 XPS studies showed O vacancies doubled in concentration over 250 min, causing the selectivity to drop to 25.2%. Whilst oxygen vacancies are necessary to activate oxygen, they decreased selectivity in the absence of HCl,231 which is why CeO2 was shown to have a much lower selectivity without the presence of HCl; a change of active species from oxygen vacancies to Cl radical like species, has been shown to increase selectivity without a large detrimental effect on conversion. However, the space time yields observed are significantly lower than the most active ODH-O2 catalysts.Co-Based catalysts have been investigated for ODH-O2, but their performance is also limited and vastly inferior to V- or B-based catalysts. However, Wang et al. developed a Co3O4/ZIF-8 catalyst that could operate at 250 C, which is about 200 C lower than the operating temperature for many ODH-O2 catalysts.232 Such low temperature activity warrants further investigation, but the reported space time yield of 7.2 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 10, entry 1) is relatively low for an ODH-O2 catalyst. Tanasoi et al. investigated various mixed metal oxides derived from layered double hydroxide precursors. CoMgAlOx exhibited the highest propene yield, but the propene selectivity was limited due to an increase in cracking, which then led to overoxidation.233 There was no correlation between reducibility and catalyst performance, suggesting that redox properties are not rate-determining in these ODH-O2 catalysts. Unfortunately, the balance of acid and base sites was not measured, so a possible correlation in this respect was not identified.Although CrOx-based catalysts have been widely investigated for DDH and ODH-CO2, there is limited research available for CrOx-catalysts for ODH-O2. Some CrOx-type catalysts have been shown to form propene, with the selective phase being Cr5O12 when supported on nano-crystalline MgO.234 The space time yield was calculated to be 11.3 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 10, entry 4), which is significantly less than Cr catalysts for DDH and about equivalent to the performance of CrOx catalysts for ODH-CO2. When supported on carbon nanotubes, the presence of Cr2O3 increased the CO active sites on the carbon nanotubes, whilst also increasing propene desorption,235 suggesting that Cr promotes the functionality of the carbon active centre.Nanocarbons are an emerging field of catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Frank et al. showed that propane can be activated by surface oxygen groups on oxidised carbon nanotubes, noting that sp2 hybridised carbon species are selective and stable for ODH-O2, and that carbon nanotubes provide a balance between reactivity (sp3) and stability (sp2).236 Nanocarbons also show high selectivity to alkenes when compared to metal oxides, but the intrinsic activity is lower. And additional feature of nanocarbons is that they are tuneable; N or B doping within the lattice leads to a change in electronic structure which can influence intrinsic catalytic activity, whilst changing surface functionality can influence selectivity. For example, adding B2O3 to the surface inhibits the activity of electrophilic oxygen species which promote overoxidation. Interestingly, this is one of the first examples of using B2O3 for ODH-O2, where it acts to inhibit the activity through functionalisation of the surface, leading to an increased selectivity. More recently, Qi et al. confirmed the ketonic carbonyl groups to be the active site for general ODH reactions, whilst also confirming the effects of B2O3.237 The unique chemical structure of nanocarbons means that the reaction mechanism does not operate under a Mars-van Krevelen or LangmuirHinshelwood route. In situ characterisation and measurements proved vital to finding the reaction mechanism for nanocarbons; in situ experiments for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using nanocarbons showed the redox cycle of carbonyl-hydroxyl groups being the basis for the reaction mechanism.Recently, Cao et al. discovered that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are highly selective to propene (75%) at a moderate conversion of 12.8%. Additionally, selectivity to ethene was 15%, meaning total olefin selectivity was around 90%. The highest STY was measured at 515 C to be 4.0 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 10, entry 11). g-C3N4 is analogous to graphite in structure, as is h-BN. The rate dependence of propane was first order, which is different to h-BN, but it was found to be the same as h-BN regarding the rate dependence of oxygen. DFT calculations suggested this first-order rate dependence of propane was due to simultaneous H abstraction by carbonyl species, which are similarly distant from one another when compared with the distance between the CH bonds in propane. The simultaneous H abstraction would therefore lead to a lower concentration of the C3H7* reaction intermediate, as well as an increased O2/O* ratio and therefore a lower likelihood of overoxidation.238 This new route to propene shows promise and enhances our understanding of selectivity patterns. The materials were shown to be activated in a similar way to h-BN, forming the proposed active site, i.e., carbonyl bonds, on the surface under oxidative conditions. Under these oxidative conditions, the surface area increased from 8.9 m2 g1 to 78.1 m2 g1, due to the formation of mesopores at the surface. The large increase in surface area when compared to the starting material, was a large factor in obtaining the high activity.While supported precious metal clusters are amongst the most researched class of catalyst for DDH (and are used in some industrial processes) their application in ODH-O2 has been relatively limited. Preliminary research into supported Pt metal clusters for ODH-O2 was reported in the early 90s, with studies comparing particle-support interactions and the influence of supports on the reaction. Notably, Hubbard et al. reported Pt/ZrO2 showed at least one order of magnitude higher activity than Pt/γ-Al2O3.239 This is due to γ-alumina seemingly deactivating the Pt, which was confirmed due to the small Pt particles on γ-alumina having a higher reduction temperature when compared to bulk Pt.To achieve high activity in supported metal catalysts, the dispersion of the supported metal must be optimised in order to maximise the number active centres and allow efficient use of the precious metal itself, which is often the most expensive component of the catalyst. Additionally, particle size and activity may not scale linearly. Vajda et al. reported that supported under-coordinated Pt810 clusters were highly active for ODH-O2.240 The activity of the catalyst in this study was shown to be much larger than the more commonly used vanadia-based catalysts, whilst showing a higher selectivity. The key to an increased activity was due to the under-coordinated Pt cluster strongly adsorbing the propane when compared to an extended Pt surface, confirmed by catalytic data which was in agreement with DFT. DFT showed a significant weakening of the CH bond when propane interacts with under-coordinated Pt clusters in comparison to Pt(111) surface.Combining Pt clusters with Sn showed increased productivity due to the electron transfer between the Pt and Sn which were in close proximity. 0.5Pt5Sn/Si-beta exhibited a STY of 40 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 10, entry 12).241 PtSn catalysts were characterised via C3H8-TPD and C3H6-TPD. In comparison to 0.5Pt/Si-Beta and 5Sn/Si-beta, 0.5Pt5Sn/Si-beta showed that the combination of the Pt and Sn led to a stronger adsorption of propane to allow for increased activity and propene desorbed more readily, leading to the understanding that propene would not be further oxidised to COx products due to a higher rate of desorption. It was also found that PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts showed an increased conversion when oxygen was introduced into the gas feed (compared to DDH conditions).242 This was due to the oxygen reacting with hydrogen to form water and driving the equilibrium towards propene formation. Conversion largely depended on the C3H8:O2 ratio: an increase in propane conversion was found with an increase in O2 concentration relative to propane concentration, but too high an oxygen concentration caused overoxidation to COx. The activity and selectivity were much higher for PtSn/SAPO-34  a yield of 72.4% as compared to a 1015% yield for most V based catalysts. Introducing oxygen into the feed also reduced the formation of coke, which is a feature of instability in DDH. Water formed via ODH-O2 was found to reduce stability, by increasing sintering of Pt due to a weaker metalsupport interaction.242 PtSn catalysts are of course widely studied for DDH and are found in industrial catalysts, as described above.In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.ODH-O2 offers many inherent advantages as the reaction is exothermic, thermodynamically unlimited and avoids formation of coke. Overall, extensive research into VOx-based catalysts has been undertaken, with the clear limitation being overoxidation to COx products, but recent developments with one-step preparations and grafting techniques have improved catalyst performance to be comparable with the most active DDH Pt- and CrOx catalysts. Deep oxidation remains a challenge for VOx and other supported metal oxides. However, it is clear than B-based catalysts, although recently developed and less understood in both structure and mechanism, have clear potential for commercialisation due to the high selectivity at high propane conversion. Additionally, ethene is formed as a secondary product. Many B-based catalysts have similar, if not higher, STYs compared to DDH catalysts. Furthering the understanding of the reaction mechanism is essential to developing more efficient catalysts, and this appears to be the focus of recent research in the literature.
6. Oxidative dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide
The so-called soft-oxidation of propane using CO2 was proposed as an alternative process to using O2 in order to decrease overoxidation to products such as CO and CO2. In the context of the global effort to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the ODH-CO2 reaction has gained a renewed interest. CO2 utilisation technologies are of general interest to develop a circular economy, but it is important to acknowledge that the current demand for propene (ca. 130 million tonnes per annum1) is a small fraction of the annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels (35 Gt).244 Therefore the ODH-CO2 process is unlikely to make a significant impact on global emissions. Additionally, there is an increased cost associated with obtaining concentrated CO2 compared to using air, as could be envisaged in an ODH-O2 process. It could be argued that commercial ODH-CO2 processes would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of an individual chemical or industrial plant that would otherwise release CO2 into the atmosphere, but this would depend on how CO is used as a by-product in the reaction. CO2 was initially utilised in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene,245 but since then has been reported for other alkane substrates, including ethane and butane.246 The addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production. Additionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly. Finally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst.
As an acidic molecule, carbon dioxide will preferentially adsorb on basic sites, which is in contrast to propane which will adsorb on acidic sites. Therefore, the correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design. Equally, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications. Thermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions.22 Interestingly, the addition of carbon dioxide has been found in some cases to be detrimental to the catalyst performance;247 this underlines the dependency of catalytic reactivity on the structure of the catalyst.
Generally, there are two proposed reaction pathways that describe the soft oxidation of propane to propene. These are described as the direct and indirect pathways: Direct pathway: C3H8 + CO2  C3H6 + H2O + CO Indirect pathway: C3H8  C3H6 + H2
H2 + CO2  H2O + CO
In the direct pathway, oxygen from CO2 abstracts the H from propane, forming H2O as a primary product. Conversely, in the indirect pathway the dehydrogenation occurs in the absence of an oxidant, and the role of CO2 is to remove H2via the RWGS reaction. It should be noted that regardless of the pathway, the RWGS reaction must mediate the balance of H2O, CO, CO2 and H2, although the contribution of RWGS to the final product distribution is often overlooked. In the following sub-sections, the literature reports concerning catalysts for ODH-CO2 are reviewed and discussed.
6.1. Chromium-based ODH-CO2 catalysts
Chromium oxide is one of the most widely investigated catalysts for the DDH reaction and as described above, is a key component of the industrial CATOFIN process. It is also one of the earliest reported transition metal oxide catalysts for the soft oxidation of propane to propene. Generally, the studies of Cr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 reactions are carried out under similar conditions to the DDH process, but with the addition of CO2 to the gas-feed, typically supplied as a 1:1 ratio or in excess of the partial pressure of propane. The performance and reaction conditions of some reported catalysts are shown below in Table 11.

AC = activated carbon.
The first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3. The catalyst tests were performed at 600 C with a feed of propane and argon or carbon dioxide.248 It was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar. In contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%. The 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition. The Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream. The stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed. Not only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.
Relative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2. Takehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6.91 After 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%. The remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range). However, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal. It was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction.249 This suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst.
Contrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions.250 They found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts. Specifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7). Across all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions. However, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction. Wu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4).251 They reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst. It is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO. Zhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6).252 The authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water. Other studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2. For instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,253 whereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species. These conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions. The ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity. Moreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2.
Cr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258 Notably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84 It was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites. A clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94 The selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties. These Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12. It should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene. Therefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported.
Takehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91 Specifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species. These Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active. It was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction. Yi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259 In a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85 Michorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption. In situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions. The reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple. Rapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air. The remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered.
Despite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260 The enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene. While this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air. This severely limits the utility of this catalyst.
Zeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3. Zhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261 Although the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2. Zhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262 CrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15). Although the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement. After 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%. The authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment. Presumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species. It should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst. Ideally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream. Recently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263 It was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%). The presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene. Moreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction. This was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. The stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction. In considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.

While the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial. Yun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264 After 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream. In contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period. Using three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction. This is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation. Interestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking. This strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts. There is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265 Crucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors.O'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst. Consistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased. A 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity. Interestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14).264 Another similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%). The enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration. Consequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr. Rather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane. However, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts.Overall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1. The role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts. The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts. While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.
6.2. Gallium-based ODH-CO2 catalysts
Gallium oxide is the second most widely studied element for ODH-CO2 catalysis, owing to its successful application for DDH, as discussed above. It was first identified as an efficient DDH catalyst in 1988 in the context of dehydrocyclodimerisation,268 but since the turn of the century it has been the subject of more intensive research.
The first application of gallium catalysts in ODH-CO2 was carried out using ethane as a substrate.269 Although ODH-CO2 using ethane is beyond the scope of the current review, it is instructive to consider the catalytic activity of Ga2O3 in the early reports from Nakagawa et al. TiO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 were selected as catalyst supports for Ga2O3 and it was found that Ga2O3/TiO2 was the most active catalyst.270 Additionally, it was found that co-feeding steam was beneficial to maintain high activity, although rapid deactivation was still apparent. Consistent with the literature on supported CrOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 to Ga2O3/Al2O3 was shown to be detrimental to ethene yield. This strongly suggests that Al2O3 is the origin of the inhibition observed in CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.248 It is known that the balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene. The addition of CO2 is likely to result in competitive adsorption on basic sites, and this may result in longer surface lifetimes of alkyl intermediates, resulting in undesirable side-reactions.
Zheng et al. investigated ODH-CO2 of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide and found that β-Ga2O3 (Table 12, entry 2) was the most active, even outperforming Cr2O3 at 500 C.271 Interestingly, this was not the case for the DDH reaction, where Cr2O3 was the most active catalyst. However, the activity of all the Ga2O3 polymorphs was lower in the presence of CO2. Subsequently, Michorczyk et al. investigated CrOx/Ga2O3 for ODH-CO2 and showed that at elevated temperatures (>570 C), the addition of CO2 is beneficial (compared to DDH).272 At 550 C, the STY was 5.3 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1. A non-oxidative reaction pathway was suggested to proceed via an initial heterolytic dissociation of propane, form a gallium alkoxide and a gallium hydride species. Then proton abstraction occurs, leaving H+ and H on the surface of the gallium oxide and propene. The abstraction of the second H atom is slow and considered rate-limiting. The authors suggested that this can be enhanced by a secondary equilibrium involving the surface migration of a surface proton. This equilibrium is as follows: H + C3H7+ + H+-support  H + H+ + C3H7+-support Table 12 Catalytic performance of selected gallium-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 Entry Catalyst T/C CO2/C3H8 WHSV/gC3H8 gcat1 h1 XC3H8/% SC3H6/% STY/molC3H6 kg1cat h1 Ref. 1 Ga2O3Al2O3 500 2 0.15 49.7 91.7 1.4 274 2 β-Ga2O3 500 2 0.15 23 94 0.7 271 3 Ga2O3Al2O3 550 5 1.2 19 91.6 4.3 273 4 CrOx/β-Ga2O3 550 7 0.89 33.7 84.7 5.3 272 5 Ga2O3/Al2O3 600 2 0.30 26 94 1.5 114 6 GaN/SiO2 600 2 1.8 31 93 11 276 7 Ga2O3Al2O3 600 2 0.15 49.7 91.7 1.6 275 8 Ga2O3/ZSM-48 600 2 0.30 52.6 42.2 1.5 113 T = reaction temperature; CO2/C3H8 = molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 in the reaction, XC3H8 = initial propane conversion, SC3H6 = initial propene selectivity, STY = space time yield.
This results in the formation of propene via: C3H7+-support  C3H6 + H+-support These reactions are facilitated by Lewis acid sites, specifically tetrahedral Ga ions. The role of CO2 in ODH-CO2 is to assist the above equilibrium by removing H2via the RWGS reaction.
The effect of the support was closely examined for propane ODH-CO2 by Xu et al.114 It was found that Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibited high activity, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performing catalysts. However, consistent with previous reports it was found that the addition of CO2 to the reaction feed was detrimental when Al2O3 and ZrO2 were used as supports and higher propane conversion was observed when using lower CO2:C3H8 ratios. Despite this, the propene yield was highest over Ga2O3/Al2O3 in ODH-CO2, the equivalent of 1.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 12, entry 5). The low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites. In addition to the acidbase properties of the support, the authors considered the interaction between the Ga and the support to be of importance. In the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced. This catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.
Although the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial,114,273 Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.274,275 At 600 C, although the initial propane conversion was similar for DDH and ODH-CO2, after 8 h on-stream the stability of the catalyst was markedly improved in the presence of CO2, where Ga8Al2O15 retained 66% of its initial activity, compared to just 44% in the absence of CO2. The origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst. Using NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity. These acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke. While many previous studies on ODH-CO2 have shown Al2O3 to be detrimental to catalyst performance (compared with DDH activity), this investigation highlights the sensitivity of the catalyst performance to the structure of the surface, and the acidbase properties therein.
Ren et al. studied the effect of acidity and pore geometry in Ga2O3 supported on ZSM-48 and ZSM-5.113 At 600 C, the most active catalyst, Ga2O3/ZSM-48 with a Si:Al ratio of 130, demonstrated a 22.2% propene yield, although the selectivity to propene was only 42% (Table 12, entry 8). Aromatics (including retained carbonaceous products) accounted for 40% of the converted carbon. An increase in the Si:Al ratio resulted in an increase in propene selectivity on both H-ZSM-5 and ZSM-48 supports. Compared with DDH, in ODH-CO2 the propane conversion was slightly higher, but the propene selectivity was lower, resulting in a marginally decreased propene yield. The increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites.
Recently, it has been shown that gallium nitride can function as a highly active catalyst for ODH-CO2 when supported on porous SiO2.276 At 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2, the catalyst exhibited a propane conversion of 31% and a propene selectivity of 93%, equivalent to a STY of 11 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 12, entry 6), the highest value reported for any Ga-based catalyst. Although some deactivation was observed (ca. 83% of initial steady state activity retained after 8 h on-stream), the catalysts can be considered to be amongst the most stable reported to date. While the authors did not investigate the reaction mechanism of the supported GaN, it is instructive to consider the observed induction period in each catalyst whereby the propane conversion increases over the first 12 h; for the most active catalyst it increases from 20% to 30% in this timeframe. A similar induction period has been observed over BN catalysts for the ODH-O2 of propane by Hermans et al., amongst others,196,202,204 which was ascribed to the oxidation of BN to form active B-OH groups. It is reasonable to suggest that a similar oxidation/hydroxylation of the GaN surface occurs here, although it is unclear how, or even if, CO2 could facilitate this in situ. XPS of the as-prepared samples showed a large O 1s signal, but this was ascribed to adsorbed H2O.
Overall, Ga2O3 can be considered to be moderately active for ODH-CO2, with reasonable propene yields, but generally poor stability. In most cases, the inclusion of CO2 is not beneficial for the reaction. Compared with CrOX, Ga typically results in lower propene yield and comparable stability. The recent breakthrough regarding GaN, however, is very noteworthy. With a similar STY to the most active CrOX catalysts and relatively good on-stream stability at high conversion (ca. 30%), this new class of Ga catalysts has real potential. Future research into GaN catalysts should seek to understand the reaction mechanism in order to identify the active sites and improve catalyst performance further.
6.3. Metal oxide based ODH-CO2 catalysts
In addition to chromium and gallium, a selection of other oxide catalysts, mostly of transition metals, have been explored for their ODH-CO2 activity. This section details the most significant advances made to date with respect to these other metal oxides.
Bulk and supported iron oxides have been investigated by Michorczyk et al.277 Unsupported Fe2O3 exhibited reasonable activity at 600 C when using a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, with a propene yield of 7.5%. The activity was four times higher than in the absence of CO2, and the propene selectivity increased from 84 to 92.5%. The dispersion of Fe2O3 on activated carbon significantly improved the conversion of propane from 8.2 to 29.7%, which corresponds to a STY of 16.1 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13 entry 7). In contrast, using Al2O3 as a support for the Fe2O3 inhibited the performance of the catalyst. The reaction mechanism was concluded to proceed via a redox pathway, whereby the lattice oxygen associated with the iron oxide directly participates in the reaction.

AC = activated carbon.
A 5 wt% ZnO/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was investigated by Ren et al. using a broad range of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (60, 120, 160, 201 and 242) at 600 C.278 While all of the prepared catalysts exhibited some activity (with conversion ranging from 4086%), the highest propene yield was observed over ZnO/H-ZSM-5 (160), which was 46.8% (Table 13, entry 3). In each catalyst, the main competing pathway was to aromatics, which is consistent with the use of ZSM-5 in aromatisation catalysis.247 It was recognised that CO2 both promotes the RWGS reaction over the supported ZnO catalysts, but also blocks active sites. The stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.
Indium oxide and various mixed-metal oxides containing In have been considered as ODH-CO2 catalysts in recent years. Chen et al. initially demonstrated that In2O3 was active, but also showed that the performance is improved as a binary oxide of In2O3Al2O3.279 Specifically, In20Al80OX exhibited the highest propene yield under the reaction conditions used (600 C, CO2:C3H8 = 4:1), which was ca. 27% (Table 13, entry 5). Interestingly, each of the mixed metal catalysts exhibited an induction period over the first 3 h, followed by moderate deactivation. In contrast, Al2O3 and In2O3 alone deactivated much more rapidly on-stream and without an induction period. The origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide. Chen et al. also considered a wide range of secondary metal oxides for this reaction, using solgel or co-precipitation to prepare In2O3MOx, where x = Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce.280 It was shown that the In2O3Al2O3 combination was the most active, due in part to the high dispersion of In in this particular catalyst. Further investigation into the composition of the support revealed that compared with ZrO2 and SiO2, Al2O3 was the most effective support for In2O3, although ZrO2 was also active.281 The basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity. This conclusion was supported by the substantial increase in the activity observed in ODH-CO2 compared with DDH. Tian et al. recently investigated In/H-ZSM-5.282 At 580 C and a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 4:1, the highest propene yield was 10%. Although the propane conversion was similar without In present, the selectivity was significantly increased from 28% for H-ZSM-5 to 81% for 4 wt% In/H-ZSM-5 (Table 13, entry 2).
Supported vanadia catalysts have also been considered in ODH-CO2 having been widely applied in various reactions, including propane ODH-O2,4 toluene oxidation283 and formaldehyde oxidation.284 Vanadia catalysts for ODH-CO2 were first reported by Nakagawa et al. and in this early study, supported vanadia was found to outperform Ga2O3.249 Despite this, few studies have been reported since.285 Notably, Ascoop et al. investigated the role of CO2 in the reaction over composite WOXVOX/SiO2 catalysts. Using D2 as a co-feed, it was shown that 45% of the resultant water contained D2O. This confirmed a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism as well as a two-step DDH + RWGS mechanism proceeds over this catalyst. It was found that CO2 could partially re-oxidise the catalyst and that coke formation was significantly suppressed in the presence of CO2. Han et al. examined a range of VOX loadings using an MCM-41 as a support.286 The most active catalyst, 6.8 wt% VOx/MCM-41, exhibited an initial propene yield of 51% at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 4:1. However, the catalyst retained only 65% of its initial activity after 2 h on-stream. The initial STY of this catalyst was 10.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13, entry 4), which is amongst the most active reported to date, but requires significant improvements to its on-stream stability.
Tsilomelekis and Wang recently investigated mixed metal oxides comprising Fe and Ce for the ODH-CO2 reaction. It was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield. The propene selectivity of this catalyst was ca. 45% at 550 C with a propane conversion of ca. 18%. The major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking. They showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1. However, the catalysts were relatively stable on-stream over 20 h, retaining 80% of their initial activity. Despite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).
6.4. Supported nanoparticle based ODH-CO2 catalysts
Despite forming an active component in various industrial DDH processes and being extensively reported in the academic literature for DDH, the number of studies carried out over Pt-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 is comparatively low. This is also true of other noble metals such as Pd, Au and Ru, where only a handful of studies are available. In this section, the available literature on supported nanoparticle (NP) catalysts, including noble metals, is discussed.
The earliest report of utilising a supported metal NP in ODH-CO2 was by Guo et al. in 2005 who compared Ga and Re supported on H-ZSM-5 (Table 14, entry 4).247 It was shown that at 550 C, the addition of CO2 inhibited the propane conversion significantly and did not greatly affect the selectivity to propene (5.7%). As described above, aromatisation tends to be the dominant pathway when H-ZSM-5 is used.

Supported gold catalysts, which are widely used as catalysts for oxidation reactions288 including the epoxidation of propene,289 were studied by Tth et al. When Au NPs supported on MgO, ZnO or Al2O3 were investigated over a broad temperature range (500750 C), only Au/ZnO exhibited reasonable catalytic activity. The propene selectivity was 56% at 50% conversion at 600 C. The Au/ZnO material was shown to be very unreactive towards propene and evidence for propane activation at 25 C was found. Despite this promising initial data, Au NP catalysts have not been investigated further.
Gomez et al. investigated various mono- and bi-metallic NP catalysts using CeO2 as a support at a reaction temperature of 650 C and a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 1:1 (Table 14, entries 2 and 3).21,290 Among the wide range of catalysts tested were Ni1, Fe1 and Fe3-Ni1 (where the subscript number indicates the molar ratio). While Ni1 was active mostly for dry reforming to CO + H2, Fe1 was inactive. However, Fe3-Ni1 exhibited much higher selectivity towards propene. In situ XAS measurements revealed that under reaction conditions Fe was oxidised and Ni was metallic. While the overall performance of Fe3-Ni1 was moderate (58% selectivity to propene at 2.7% propane conversion, equivalent to a STY of 3.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1), the findings demonstrate the sensitivity of reaction pathways to the nanostructure of the catalyst and suggest further optimisation is possible. Subsequent studies on FeCo and FePd catalysts revealed similar trends, whereby the addition of Fe to Co or Pd boosted the selectivity to propene compared with the corresponding monometallic catalyst. However, in all cases the dry reforming reaction competed with the dehydrogenation pathway, significantly limiting the propene selectivity.290 Nowicka et al. carried out a detailed investigation into Pd/CeZrAlOX catalysts.291 It was shown that CO2 dissociation on the catalyst support was facilitated by the presence of Pd. At 500 C the catalyst achieved 9.5% conversion and 93% selectivity to propene. Although the STY was 4.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, (Table 14, entry 1) the reaction temperature was 500 C, which is low for ODH-CO2 catalysts. Above this temperature, the selectivity to propene rapidly drops and methane and carbon monoxide production increase. It should also be noted that propene selectivity was calculated based on observed products, rather than propane consumption and therefore the contribution of dry reforming was not measured.
Metal carbides have been intensively investigated in recent years for a broad range of reactions and are often described as having properties analogous to precious metals.292294 To date, there have been two reports of metal carbides catalysing ODH-CO2, both of which focus on Mo2C.295,296 It was found that in addition to dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and reforming played important roles in the reaction network. Overall, the performance of the carbide catalysts was poor compared to typical metal oxide or supported nanoparticle catalysts (Table 14, entry 5).
The number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential. The major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts. Careful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways.Despite the fact that ODH-CO2 of light alkanes has been known for over twenty years, catalyst design has largely been limited to a handful of metal oxide catalysts, namely chromia and gallia. The most promising of these catalysts are supported metal oxides, which typically result in high initial propene yields. However, all catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation on-stream, which is typically attributed to coke formation blocking active sites. However, few investigations have studied the long-term stability of the catalyst beyond 12 h on-stream. In many cases, the catalyst can be regenerated periodically, by burning off the coke using O2. As discussed above, catalyst regeneration is commonplace in commercial DDH processes and therefore isn't necessarily a barrier to commercialisation. However, the best STYs reported are, with few exceptions, in the range of 510 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, whereas for the DDH reaction, values over 100 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 are possible. As a result, further advances in the activation of propane over ODH-CO2 catalysts are required. Despite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental. The knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.
7. Oxidative dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide
O2 and CO2 are currently the most commonly reported oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, other oxidants have also been shown to be feasible. Sulfur dioxide and halogen-based compounds have largely been ignored in recent decades due to their corrosive properties, while H2O2 has had its commercialisation deferred due to difficulties in its synthesis.297 Another relevant oxidant, however, is N2O. It should be noted that N2O is a greenhouse gas which has a global warming potential approximately 310 times higher than that of CO2.298,299 Therefore, processes that remove N2O gas from the atmosphere are highly desirable. The industrial sector produces N2O as a by-product from various processes, including nitric and adipic acid production as well as fossil fuel combustion sources which make up a total of 15% of anthropogenic sources.298 Many production plants will have N2O abatement in place already, so the possibility for flowing propane through this process exists. Despite this, research into the ODH-N2O reaction of propane is rather limited, mostly due to the cost of N2O and product dilution in N2. Furthermore the research that does exist is reserved for elucidating structureactivity relationships, which can be used to better understand the ODH reaction in general.300
7.1. Fe-Zeolite based ODH-N2O catalysts
In 1998 Panov et al.301 reported a new type of O species observed in Fe-ZSM-5 when it was exposed to N2O. The species was referred to as α-oxygen and is able to perform highly selective dehydrogenation and oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons such as the oxidation of benzene to phenol, which occurred with nearly 100% selectivity at conversions of 9798%. In addition, dehydrogenation of ethane and methane oxidation reactions are also possible using N2O. Panov further detailed the characteristics of α-oxygen. It is typically associated with isolated Fe ions or small complexes found within the zeolite's micropores, as opposed to the tetrahedral Fe ions within the crystal lattice, or the finely dispersed metal oxide phase of the zeolite surface. It has been suggested that this oxygen species could be useful in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.Other examples of ZSM-5 modified catalysts on top of Fe include doping with metals such as Mn and Co.302 The authors examined the selectivity, conversion and yield of propene of these three materials. While all three showed similar selectivity (between 7080%), Fe-ZSM-5 was reported to exhibit the highest conversion and therefore best yield towards propene. The α-oxygen species is formed via the interaction between N2O and framework stabilised Fe2+ ions, resulting in the dissociation of N2O and the formation of mono- and bi-nuclear Fe3+O species, (α-oxygen). These α-oxygen species react with propane by providing atomic oxygen, producing propanol, which is subsequently dehydrated to propene.303,304 It is from this mechanism that the selectivity originates, because once the hydrocarbon's interaction with α-oxygen is complete, the molecule would need to vacate the zeolite channel in order for a new N2O molecule to enter and generate an new α-oxygen site, therefore not allowing for immediate further oxidation.301 It is also evident from this mechanism that coordination of oxygen to an Fe2+ species is required, and therefore does not occur on tetrahedral framework Fe species due to a lack of vacant sites in the Fe complex.303 By considering simply the activation of N2O, Groen et al.305 enhanced the activation by performing an alkaline treatment on Fe-ZSM-5, which increased the number of Fe2+ sites, decreased the amount of oligonuclear clusters and increased the porosity of the zeolite. The calcined catalysts were treated in 0.2 M NaOH for 2 h, before undergoing an ion-exchange in NH4NO3 solution. Where the calcined Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst reached complete conversion of N2O at 552 C, the catalysts which had undergone alkaline treatment and subsequent ion-exchange reached total conversion at slightly under 527 C. This increase in porosity and highly active Fe sites shows potential for the dehydrogenation reaction of propane, however little research effort has extended into this area.305,306 Further to this, Prez-Ramrez et al.303,307 reported highly active catalysts after the steam treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites, which produced an initial STY of 180 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 15, entry 2) when carried out at 525 C. This high productivity is ascribed to the generation of extra-framework Fe sites during the steam treatment.303,307,308 However, this high productivity is hindered by a rapid deactivation, with the authors observing a minimum decrease in propene yield of ca. 3% over 3 h at 452 C, and a maximum decrease in propene yield of ca. 12% over the same timescale at 525 C. This rapid deactivation, which will be discussed further, is the most significant issue facing the use of N2O as an oxidant to date.Table 15 Comparison of catalytic performance of selected catalysts for the ODH-N2O reaction Entry Catalyst T/C N2O/C3H8 WHSV /gC3H8 gcat1 h1 XC3H8/% SC3H6/% STY/molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 Ref. 1 FeH-MFI-1200-HT 450 1 3.0 64 29 12 309 2 Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 450 1 39.4 48 45 180 303 3 VOx/MCM-41 475 1    29 313 4 Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 500 1 2.4 29.2 68.8 10 311 5 In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide 600 4 0.15 43.6 63.1 6.8 316 T = reaction temperature; N2O/C3H8 = molar ratio of N2O:C3H8 in the reaction, XC3H8 = initial propane conversion, SC3H6 = initial propene selectivity, STY = space time yield. Values next to element/phase is the loading in wt%.The main deactivation pathway of this catalyst is ascribed to the build-up of carbonaceous deposits at the Brnsted acid sites in the zeolite pores, therefore blocking the pores and active Fe sites. It has been reported that blocking or removing the Brnsted acid sites lessens the impact of deactivation.303,309 Despite being the major deactivation pathway, compared to other zeolite examples, ZSM-5 shows significant resistance to deactivation, despite the finding that they produce more coke than other examples. This behaviour is attributed to the location of the coke formation, which occurs at Al-protonic sites, away from the extra-framework Fe-active sites.303 However, the use of N2O as an oxidant invariably leads to rapid deactivation despite the positive effect of the zeolite, when compared to other oxidants, such as O2. Using a mixture of oxidant gases, O2 and N2O, was reported to decrease the deactivation of Fe-ZSM-5 further via oxidising the carbon deposits.309 The limitation of this being the inclusion of too much O2, leads to overoxidation of the desired products and therefore lower selectivity towards propene. Bulnek et al. reported that a mixture of N2O and O2 over a steam-treated Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst and found that with the inclusion of oxygen the conversion consistently increased; however, the selectivity consistently decreased (Table 15, entry 1).309 The problem remains, that when comparing oxidant properties for the ODH reaction of propane, N2O has a significant tendency for rapid deactivation.In 2010, Kowalska-Ku et al.310 investigated the role of Brnsted acid sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and their effect on the ODH-N2O activity. It was found that in the presence of a high number of protonic sites, cracking and ODH reactions of propane occurred simultaneously, and would often lead to high selectivity towards total oxidation products. Conversely, removal of protonic sites via doping with sodium reduced the oxidative activity of the zeolite and modified the reaction to favour the ODH pathway. Subsequently, the propene would undergo further cracking reactions. Therefore, shorter contact times result in higher propene selectivity. This method led to propene selectivities higher than previously reported for this reaction, (over 80%), but the limitation of this approach is the significantly lowered conversion due to the lower oxidative activity of the zeolite.It is clear that adjusting the acidity of the zeolite greatly influences the conversion and selectivity of the ODH-N2O reaction. As mentioned earlier, steam treatment has been found to increase the number of Fe2+ active sites. This, as well as dealuminating the zeolites, leads to a higher presence of weak and medium acid sites, which enhance selectivity towards propene.304,311 Steam treatment was also found to increase stability towards coking in the zeolites.311 With these methodologies implemented, Ates et al.311 were able to produce a catalyst with a STY of 10 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 15, entry 4).In summary, while the ODH-N2O reaction is hindered significantly by its tendency to deactivate rapidly without the presence of O2, Fe-ZSM-5 as a catalyst is very resistant to deactivation and its use for the ODH-N2O reaction is contingent on several factors. The oxidation of extra-framework Fe2+ sites to Fe3+O sites is a crucial step in the mechanism, and therefore producing a material with a large number of these sites would increase the yield of propene. The Brnsted acidity of the Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite both decreases the selectivity to propene, due to a high number of protonic sites leading to selectivity towards total oxidation, and increases the rate of deactivation, allowing for the generation of carbonaceous deposits which block the zeolite pores. The most promising materials currently are steamed Fe-ZSM-5, as the steam treatment has been found to produce more Fe2+ sites and dealuminate the framework, causing an increase in weak and medium acid sites. With fewer strong protonic sites, the reaction mechanism shifts towards favouring the dehydrogenation of propane, therefore resulting in a consecutive propane dehydrogenation-propene cracking pathway which allows for a higher selectivity to propene with shorter contact times. Despite these advancements, recent research on Fe-ZSM-5 for ODH-N2O has been minimal due to their rapid deactivation, the high cost of N2O and the presence of N2 in the product stream.
7.2. Other ODH-N2O catalysts
Other catalysts reported to be active for the ODH-N2O reaction of propane include supported vanadium oxides. In 2001 Kondratenko et al.312 reported that VOx/γ-Al2O3 was active for ODH of propane with O2 and N2O and investigated the effect of vanadia loading. It was found that, similar to Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, on replacing O2 with N2O the overall activity of the catalyst decreased, but the selectivity increased. This trend was ascribed to the lower oxidising potential of N2O.
Further to this, DFT studies were carried out to elucidate the role of the oxidant in the ODH reaction.300 These calculations first revealed that propene is formed via successive removal of two hydrogen atoms via a redox mechanism over VOx active sites. The active sites are reduced from V5+ to V3+ and V4+ during hydrogen removal from the propane molecule, which then require re-oxidation before removal of a second hydrogen. The N2O was found to only oxidise V3+, whereas O2 was able to oxidise both V3+ and V4+. Upon re-oxidation of the VOx active sites with O2, peroxovanadates were formed; however these species were not formed with N2O as the oxidant. Peroxovanadates are highly active for the total oxidation of propane. The formation of these peroxovanadates is a key explanation for the more selective nature of N2O compared to O2. In the most active catalyst, the STY of VOx/MCM-41 was 29 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 15, entry 3), which is less than the most active steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, but more active than some reports over Fe-MFI catalysts.
In addition, V/γ-Al2O3, V/MCM-41, and V/amorphous SiO2 catalysts have also been prepared and characterised in order to elucidate the structure activity relationships between the catalyst and the ODH-N2O reaction of propane.313315 It was found that the selectivity for propene was lower over V/γ-Al2O3; a result which was ascribed to the acidic nature of the alumina support, over which dehydrogenated propene adsorbed to the support surface where it further oxidised to COx species. This effect is less prominent on less acidic support surfaces such as SiO2 and MCM-41.
The vanadia loading on the support materials was also found to influence the selectivity.312314 On the materials V/MCM-41, and V/SiO2 materials, the nature and distribution of the V remained consistent up to a loading of ca. 5 wt%, above which three-dimensional V2O5 clusters began to form, and these have unreactive bulk V sites. At lower loadings however, the support surface is more exposed, allowing for adsorption of propene and total oxidation. Therefore, a loading of ca. 5 wt% is optimal to get a high surface coverage, without forming three-dimensional clusters. Kondratenko et al. were able to achieve selectivities of over 90% at conversions limited to 2 and 10% with such materials.315 Finally, in 2010, Chen et al. reported the use of In2O3-Al2O3 as a novel catalyst for the ODH-CO2.279 In 2011 the same group reported the same catalyst's potential for the ODH-N2O reaction.316 The activity of the In2O3Al2O3 catalyst shows a significant dependence on the concentration of In0 in the material. The catalyst exhibited a low STY of 6.8 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 15, entry 5). Despite this, the In2O3Al2O3 catalyst shows potential to surpass the more commonly researched Fe-zeolites in terms of stability. Whereas previous examples of Fe-zeolites have displayed significant deactivation over 3 h time-on-stream, this In-based catalyst was observed to lose 6% propene yield over a total of 12 h on stream. Considering that deactivation is the most significant issue plaguing the use of N2O as an oxidant in the ODH-N2O reaction of propane, the In2O3-Al2O3 has good potential to be an active and stable catalyst.In summary, although Fe-ZSM-5 has the most potential for the ODH-N2O reaction for propane, several other catalysts have been tested. Vanadia based catalysts have been shown to be highly active for the reaction, which were found to be more selective when supported on less acidic, silica-based support materials, and at loading levels of lower than 5 wt%. Indium based catalysts have also been suggested for the ODH-N2O reaction, with the potential for a highly stable catalyst compared to Fe-ZSM-5, which displays significant deactivation and is likely to be the underlying reason behind the relatively low research effort put into the N2O route compared to the other potential oxidants described in this review article.
8. Summary of propane dehydrogenation and over-arching themes in catalyst design
In the above sections, the literature on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has been critically reviewed. Each sub-reaction of propane dehydrogenation has specific kinetic and thermodynamic requirements, and this is reflected in the diverse variety of catalysts that have been developed in recent decades. Throughout this review we have attempted to compare the productivity of catalysts for DDH and the various ODH reactions by measuring space time yield of the catalyst (i.e., the moles of propene produced per kg of catalyst per hour). This is an imperfect metric with which to compare catalysts, but the wide range of reaction conditions and catalyst types explored means that calculating turnover frequencies for each catalyst is not possible. One assumption when comparing productivity is that catalysts are tested under conditions to maximise their performance. This is of course not the case for all studies, especially those where kinetic measurements were of interest, or where there were other constraints present. However, by comparing the range of values associated with a single class of catalyst, it is possible to identify the highest performing catalysts in each class and broadly assess the potential of each. Fig. 11 below compares a selection of literature catalysts (presented in Tables 214) for each reaction, colour-coded to highlight the performance of different elements in different reactions. The horizontal dashed line is marked at the equivalent of 5 kgC3H6 kgcat h1, which has been considered to be space time yield that may warrant consideration of commercial application.196,213 Such a value is difficult to pinpoint, but given that this is where the more active Pt and CrOX catalysts for DDH are found, it is reasonable.
Fig. 11 Space time yield plot of a selection of DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 catalysts, showing the relative performance of catalysts in each sub-reaction.
It is clear that for the DDH reaction, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts dominate the highest space time yield measurements. This is expected given their widespread use in industrial processes. Beyond this, ZrO2 and ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts perform strongly, and their low cost and low toxicity make them well-suited for commercial application. These materials have only recently been reported in the literature and with further development they may match or outperform Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. It is also possible that they are already present in the K-PRO process.
In ODH-O2, B-based catalysts are the best performing, with STY values in excess of 70 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 reported. Some boron catalysts exceeded 200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, well above the 5 kgC3H6 kgcat h1 threshold and underscores their potential for commercial application. Although ODH-O2 produces H2O as a side-product (rather than H2), ethene is typically the major by-product in B-catalysed reactions rather than coke formation. As an exothermic reaction, large-scale implementation may be preferable to the endothermic DDH reaction, which requires specific heat-generating technology to be efficient. Therefore the commercialisation of a ODH-O2 process using B catalysts may be realistic.
ODH-CO2 catalysts do not yield more than ca. 20 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, which suggests that CO2 activation remains a key challenge. While CrOx based catalysts yield the highest STY, only incremental advances have been made in recent years and it will take a step-change in catalyst development before ODH-CO2 can be meaningfully compared to DDH and ODH-O2 reactions, as a mean to produce propene. Interestingly, some of the highest STY values reported are CrOX/activated carbon and FeOX/activated carbon. The obvious drawback of activated carbon as a support is that oxidative regenerations will combust the support, but clearly its chemical properties are desirable as a catalyst support.
In ODH-N2O, Fe-ZSM-5 are the most active catalysts known, and in one example a STY of 178 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was reported. ODH-N2O is the least studied sub-reaction and it is thought that the relatively high cost and low availability of N2O may be the most limiting aspect. N2O is a by-product in various chemical processes including adipic acid and nitric acid production, but there may be few other opportunities for large-scale sequestration and utilisation of N2O on an industrial scale. It is also apparent that the selectivity to propene is often below 70% and the catalysts rapidly deactivate on-stream.
Table 16 below shows a summary of the typical chemical and catalytic properties associated with each reaction. While the temperature range of each reaction overlaps, generally ODH-O2 and ODH-N2O are carried out at lower temperature than DDH, while ODH-CO2 typically lies in between or nearer to DDH reaction temperatures. In terms of side-reactions, cracking is the only common source of by-products in each sub-reaction. Coking remains a major challenge in DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-N2O, while overoxidation is generally observed in the ODH-O2 and ODH-N2O processes. Redox sites play an active role in each of the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, while in DDH they are not required. The importance of acid and base sites have been frequently examined across each sub-reaction, and interestingly remain the only catalytic properties that are applicable to each sub-reaction. Acid sites are widely known to activate alkanes, but if the acid sites are too strong, the alkane will be retained on the surface and lead to coking, or overoxidation in the case of ODH-N2O and ODH-O2 reactions. Basic sites on the other hand, are known to facilitate alkene desorption and in the case of ODH-CO2, to activate CO2. Therefore, a balance of these sites is necessary to promote sufficient propane activation and propene desorption. Prevalent deactivation mechanisms also vary between sub-reactions, with coking frequently cited as a cause for loss of on-stream activity in DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-N2O. The ODH-O2 catalysts on the other hand are generally much more stable on-stream. It is noteworthy however, that despite relatively fast deactivation of DDH catalysts, the activity can be regenerated after an oxidative treatment, significantly extending the catalyst lifetime.

This is exemplified by supported chromium oxides, which have been reported for DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2. On the other hand, Fe-ZSM-5, which is highly active for ODH-N2O has a unique dimeric Fe2+ site that can activate N2O but not O2. Therefore, it would not be applicable to ODH-O2 or DDH. The ability of Cr to catalyse multiple sub-reactions is likely to be related to its stability (and activity) in multiple valence states. In DDH, Cr3+ sites are considered the active species, while in ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2, the redox cycle of Cr to Cr4+ and Cr3+ all facilitate the activation of the oxidant. Supported vanadia catalysts can also exhibit multiple valence states, and are also active in DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2.
Aside from the active element, catalyst supports also comprise a vital component of any propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase. This has been demonstrated multiple times over metal oxides such as those of Ga, Cr, V and Fe, where SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 have been widely implemented as supports. The acid and base sites of the support also affect the performance of the catalyst and can be adjusted with promotors. This strategy has been widely applied in DDH catalysts. The support may also play a more active role in catalysis, by activating propane, CO2 or O2.
A multitude of chemical elements including precious metals, rare earth metals, base metals and non-metals have all been discovered to play a role in catalysing propane dehydrogenation in various contexts. Any sustainable process should aim to use abundant and renewable raw materials, and this applies to the catalyst as well as the starting reactants. It is clear that across the more active propane dehydrogenation catalysts known, there is a range in the abundance and production of the chemical elements required. Table 17 summarises the availability of a range of chemical elements commonly applied in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.Table 17 Global production and abundance of chemical elements typically employed in propane dehydrogenation catalysts Chemical element Common mineral form Annual production in 2019/103 tonnes Estimated world reserves/103 tonnes Boron B2O3, other borates >3500 >1200000 Chromium chromite 44000 570000 Gallium Trace element in other minerals (<50 ppm) 0.44a 560a Palladium Metallic 0.21 Unknown Platinum Metallic 0.18 Unknown Vanadium Oxidic form 73 >63000 Zinc Spharelite 13000 1900000 Zirconium ZrSiO4 1400 64000 a From ref. 317 which uses data for 2014. Unless otherwise stated, the values were reproduced from ref. 318.In the DDH reaction, the most active elements are typically Pt and Cr, which are already implemented in commercial processes, and more recently Zr and Zn-based alternatives have been used. While chromium is relatively abundant as a chemical element, Pt is very scarce and production limited to a few countries, namely South Africa. The global reserves of individual platinum group metals (PGMs) is not possible to accurately quantify, but it is estimated that the total global reserve of PGMs is over 100000 tonnes meaning that Pt and Pd are easily the most scarce chemical elements commonly used for propane dehydrogenation. While supported nanoparticle catalysts use a fraction of the quantity of metal that would be required in a metal oxide catalyst, it would be desirable for any DDH process to use an abundant, non-toxic element as the main component of the catalyst. This makes the recent discovery of Zr/TiZnOx all the more promising.157 The ODH-O2 reaction has recently been dominated by the discovery of boron-based catalysts, which are highly abundant compared to most other ODH-O2 catalysts such as V. Accordingly it should be considered a good candidate for commercialisation from the point of view of sustainability. ODH-CO2 catalysts are typically Cr or Ga based. As described above, Cr is highly abundant but also toxic. Gallium is present in the Earth's crust at around 17 ppm (ref. 319) and is typically found as an impurity in minerals such as bauxite, sphalerite and germanite. Although present as a trace element in these minerals, the abundance of bauxite is vast and it is estimated that the amount of gallium contained in bauxite alone is 560000 tonnes, which places it well above platinum in abundance. The field of research into DDH and ODH-O2 is very diverse, and in recent years a number of novel discoveries has expanded the range of catalytically active elements known for this reaction. This means that the reliance on scarce elements like Pt, or toxic ones like Cr is limited. Future sustainable DDH and ODH-O2 processes should capitalise on this knowledge and implement abundant elements such as B, Zn, V or Zr. With regards to ODH-CO2, the performance of the most active catalysts is still well below what would be considered for commercialisation, but the research community should look to the successes of the abovementioned abundant elements for inspiration in designing novel ODH-CO2 catalysts.
9. Outlook
While the current focus of government policy is based on net zero carbon, it is clear that society will still need a wide range of products based on carbon-containing molecules. It is now essential that the chemical industry focusses on accessing such carbon from sustainable sources. It is likely that for the near- and mid-range future the current key platform molecules such as propene will still be required. Against this background, the dehydrogenation of propane will remain a major industrial process and its future importance is guaranteed due to the scale and breadth of propene applications in modern society. Currently, the majority of propane is sourced from non-renewable feedstocks, but the industry has recognised the need to change and steps have been taken to develop processes for renewable propane to be generated. It may be many years before so-called bio-propane can compete with non-renewable propane sources in terms of supply, but the catalytic processes described in this review will be required to enable this technology to be used. Therefore, the development of catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of an oxidant will continue to attract attention from academia and industry alike, as significant advances have been made in recent years. An analysis of the sustainability of current C3H6 production methods, namely steam cracking and methanol-to-olefins, reveals that direct dehydrogenation has several advantages in efficiency when a selective catalyst is applied. Life cycle analyses of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions using O2 and CO2 have not been carried out, due to the fact that these reactions have not been commercialised yet. However, in principle the processes have the potential to offer lower temperature routes to forming C3H6 without lengthy catalyst regeneration steps.
DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking. Therefore, the future of DDH catalyst design should focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking. Irrespective of catalyst, common themes have been established in efforts to improve CH bond activation, reducing propane and hydrogen adsorption on surface sites. Of these, supports with weak and moderate surface acidity coupled promoting elements (B, Ga, Cu and Ni to name a few) result in lower Pt utilisation, which is desirable for potentially industrially applicable catalysts. Additionally, a number of noble, non-noble based intermetallic alloys and numerous mixed metal oxides are emerging as viable alternatives to chromium oxide or platinum-based catalysts; and this presents an economic and environmental benefit. In doing so, the frequency of regeneration will be reduced, meaning that fewer CO2 forming regeneration cycles will be required, thus reducing the carbon footprint of propane production.
ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts. The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application. As a relatively stable, non-hazardous and abundant element, boron catalysts may well play a major role in future propene production processes. Furthermore, they appear to be stable on-stream in laboratory tests, although industrially relevant stability tests have not yet been reported.
ODH-CO2 has attracted interest, mostly in academia,320 due to the prospect of utilising CO2 and developing carbon neutral or carbon-negative processes. This is determined by the downstream use of CO, the primary product of CO2 dissociation. Although ODH-CO2 catalysts are not known to overoxidise propane, the drawbacks associated with DDH, i.e., coking, often remain and the inertness of CO2 means that low STYs are frequently reported. The majority of investigations thus far have focussed on Ga- or Cr-based catalysts and improvement in these catalysts has been incremental. Supported nanoparticles on the other hand, have received little attention despite showing some promising results. In this class of catalysts, minimising competing reactions such as reforming, is essential. Future catalyst design should aim to move away from Cr- and Ga-based catalysts to focus on low-temperature CO2 activation and have controlled redox and acidbase properties. For this reaction to become significant beyond academic interest, a step-change in catalyst performance is needed.
ODH-N2O is the least studied reaction and progress has not been substantial in recent years. This may be due to the unfavourable economic costs associated with using N2O as an oxidant, although in an integrated facility where N2O is produced as a by-product this could be a useful approach. In terms of catalyst performance, the most active catalyst, Fe-ZSM-5, can achieve a similar STY to the more active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts. However, the intrinsic selectivity to propene is often below 70% and is undoubtedly the main disadvantage. If propene selectivity can be improved to 90%+, the catalyst would out-perform some of the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts reported in the literature.
