Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of these materials include ZSM-5, MFI, and MOR structures. Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites usually involve template-directed growth and post-synthesis modification. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by offering larger surface areas and more active sites, leading to better stability and selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.
