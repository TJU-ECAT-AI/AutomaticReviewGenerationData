[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "These materials are synthesized through a combination of sol-gel and template methods."
[3] "Compared to traditional zeolites, they offer improved performance due to their enhanced surface area and pore structure."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores or macropores to improve accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials are produced using a blend of sol-gel and templating techniques. Compared to conventional zeolites, they exhibit superior performance thanks to their increased surface area and pore architecture.
