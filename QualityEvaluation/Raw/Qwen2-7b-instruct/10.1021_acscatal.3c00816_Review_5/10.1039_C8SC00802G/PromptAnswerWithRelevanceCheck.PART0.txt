[1] "Considering DFT uncertainty, Pt3In was found to have an activity comparable to that of pure Pt and Pt3Sn."
[2] "Meanwhile, Pt3In shows a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity compared with pure Pt."
[3] "The first dehydrogenation step was found to be the rate-controlling step on most of the facets."
[4] "The role of In can also be attributed to an apparently increasing electron transfer from In to Pt."
[5] "The adsorption energies of propylene that play a key role in selectivity and activity were correlated with the d-band center, which can be used to tune a more precise PtIn ratio for the PDH reaction in the future."

The study identified a bimetallic alloy, Pt3In, as an optimal catalyst for the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. It demonstrated that Pt3In has comparable activity to pure Pt and Pt3Sn, but shows significant enhancement in propylene selectivity compared to pure Pt. The first dehydrogenation step was identified as the rate-controlling step across most facets. The addition of In in the alloy was found to facilitate electron transfer from In to Pt, affecting the adsorption energy of propylene, which is crucial for selectivity and activity. The d-band center was found to correlate with the propylene π adsorption energy, suggesting it could be used to fine-tune the PtIn ratio for PDH reactions.

研究发现，合金Pt3In是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的理想催化剂。它证明了Pt3In的活性与纯Pt和Pt3Sn相当，但与纯Pt相比，丙烯选择性有显著提高。被识别为控制速率步骤的第一脱氢化步骤在大多数晶面中都存在。In的加入促进了从In到Pt的电子转移，影响了丙烯的吸附能，这对于选择性和活性至关重要。发现d带中心与丙烯π吸附能相关，这意味着它可以用来精确调整PtIn比例以适应PDH反应。

[1] "By incorporating linear scaling relationships, e.g. BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationships and scaling the relationship between adsorption energies of surface intermediates/transition states, the reaction rates and product selectivity can be mapped from a high dimension space including information of all elementary steps to a simple descriptor space."
[2] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."
[3] "Clearly, the error bars on the dehydrogenation barriers expand as large as 0.20.3 eV, corresponding to about 23 orders of magnitude on the predicted rate constants."
[4] "Our calculated Pt3X values (points in Fig. 3) are almost on the fitted curve, indicating that the errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable."
[5] "The first dehydrogenation step was found to be the rate-controlling step on most of the facets."

1. Linear scaling relationships, such as BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationships and scaling the relationship between adsorption energies of surface intermediates/transition states, can map reaction rates and product selectivity from a high-dimensional space to a simple descriptor space.

2. The addition of In shifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms, decreasing the binding strength of propylene and promoting its desorption, which results in higher propylene selectivity.

3. The intrinsic errors in functionals, particularly those at the GGA level DFT calculations, can lead to errors as large as 0.2 eV, corresponding to about 23 orders of magnitude on the predicted rate constants.

4. The errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable, as evidenced by the Pt3X values being close to the fitted curve in Figure 3.

5. The first dehydrogenation step is often identified as the rate-controlling step across various facets during the PDH reaction.

1. 线性缩放关系，如BrnstedEvansPolanyi关系和表面中间体/过渡态吸附能之间的缩放关系，可以将反应速率和产物选择性从包含所有基本步骤信息的高维空间映射到一个简单的描述符空间。

2. 添加In向下移动表面Pt原子的d带中心，降低了丙烯的结合强度并促进了其脱附，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。

3. 功能性的内在误差，特别是GGA水平DFT计算中的误差，可能导致高达0.2 eV的误差，对应于预测速率常数约23个数量级的差异。

4. 缩放关系引入的误差是可接受的，因为Pt3X值接近图3中拟合曲线，表明缩放关系带来的误差是可以接受的。

5. 大多数晶面上的第一脱氢化步骤通常被识别为控制步骤。

[1] "By combining the scaling relationship with the reliability analysis, we predicted the probability that candidate catalysts display better performance than Pt."
[2] "Interestingly, the recently developed Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) will generate a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, which can be used to assess the reliability of our screening results."
[3] "We successfully identified that In is potentially better than Sn as an alloy component to improve the PDH performance of pure Pt, and our synthesized PtIn catalyst does show enhanced PDH performance just like the PtSn catalyst."
[4] "Our calculated Pt3X values (points in Fig. 3) are almost on the fitted curve, indicating that the errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable."
[5] "The situation of (100) facets is almost the same as that of (211) facets (Fig. S5b and Table S8)."

The literature discusses the identification of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation through a probability analysis. The study successfully identified an optimal bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) for the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Considering DFT uncertainty, Pt3In was found to have an activity comparable to that of pure Pt and Pt3Sn. Meanwhile, Pt3In shows a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity compared with pure Pt. The study found that Pt3In shows a great balance between activity and selectivity and reaches a maximum propylene formation performance. The first dehydrogenation step was found to be the rate-controlling step on most of the facets. The addition of In is attributed to an apparently increasing electron transfer from In to Pt, which contributes to the improved propylene selectivity. The adsorption energies of propylene that play a key role in selectivity and activity were correlated with the d-band center, which can be used to tune a more precise PtIn ratio for the PDH reaction in the future.

1. The Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) generates an ensemble of variations around the prediction to assess the reliability of the screening results. The error bars for dehydrogenation barriers can expand up to 0.20.3 eV, corresponding to about 23 orders of magnitude on the predicted rate constants.

2. In Fig. 3, a criterion is set where YPt3X < YPt < 0.2 and kPt3X > kPt × 0.1, meaning that Pt3X shows better selectivity and acceptable activity.

3. The scaling relationships between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and propylene desorption free energy barrier, and between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and further dehydrogenation free energy barrier, still hold for the 2000 sets of data in the BEEF error ensemble.

4. The free energy barriers of the first dehydrogenation step for Pt(211), Pt3In(211)_Pt, and Pt3In(211)_In are nearly identical, as shown in Fig. 5a.

5. The first dehydrogenation step was identified as the rate-controlling step across most of the facets.

1. 最近开发的贝叶斯误差估计功能与范德华相关（BEEF-vdW）会生成围绕预测的大量变体集合，用于评估筛选结果的可靠性。脱氢化壁垒的误差条可以扩展到0.20.3 eV，对应于大约23个数量级的预测速率常数。

2. 在图3中，设置了一个标准：YPt3X < YPt < 0.2和kPt3X > kPt × 0.1，这意味着Pt3X具有更好的选择性和可接受的活性。

3. 脱氢化第一步自由能壁垒与丙烯脱附自由能壁垒之间的比例关系，以及脱氢化第一步自由能壁垒与进一步脱氢化自由能壁垒之间的比例关系，在BEEF错误集合的2000组数据中仍然保持稳定。

4. 如图5a所示，对于Pt(211)、Pt3In(211)_Pt和Pt3In(211)_In，第一脱氢化步骤的自由能壁垒几乎相同。

5. 几乎所有晶面的第一脱氢化步骤被识别为控制步骤。
