[1] "By combining the scaling relationship with the reliability analysis, we predicted the probability that candidate catalysts display better performance than Pt."
[2] "Interestingly, the recently developed Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) will generate a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, which can be used to assess the reliability of our screening results."
[3] "We successfully identified that In is potentially better than Sn as an alloy component to improve the PDH performance of pure Pt, and our synthesized PtIn catalyst does show enhanced PDH performance just like the PtSn catalyst."
[4] "Our calculated Pt3X values (points in Fig. 3) are almost on the fitted curve, indicating that the errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable."
[5] "The situation of (100) facets is almost the same as that of (211) facets (Fig. S5b and Table S8)."

The literature discusses the identification of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation through a probability analysis. The study successfully identified an optimal bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) for the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Considering DFT uncertainty, Pt3In was found to have an activity comparable to that of pure Pt and Pt3Sn. Meanwhile, Pt3In shows a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity compared with pure Pt. The study found that Pt3In shows a great balance between activity and selectivity and reaches a maximum propylene formation performance. The first dehydrogenation step was found to be the rate-controlling step on most of the facets. The addition of In is attributed to an apparently increasing electron transfer from In to Pt, which contributes to the improved propylene selectivity. The adsorption energies of propylene that play a key role in selectivity and activity were correlated with the d-band center, which can be used to tune a more precise PtIn ratio for the PDH reaction in the future.

文献讨论了通过概率分析识别Pt基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。研究成功地确定了最优双金属合金（Pt3In）用于丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）。考虑到第一性原理不确定性，Pt3In的活性与纯Pt和Pt3Sn相当。同时，Pt3In的丙烯选择性相比纯Pt有了显著提高。研究发现，Pt3In在活性和选择性之间取得了很好的平衡，并达到了最大的丙烯生成性能。第一脱氢步骤被发现在大多数晶面都是控制步骤。In的加入被认为是从In到Pt的电子转移增加，这有助于提高丙烯的选择性。丙烯的吸附能，在选择性和活性中起关键作用，与d带中心成正相关，可以用来调整未来的PDH反应中更精确的PtIn比例。
