[1] "By incorporating linear scaling relationships, e.g. BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationships and scaling the relationship between adsorption energies of surface intermediates/transition states, the reaction rates and product selectivity can be mapped from a high dimension space including information of all elementary steps to a simple descriptor space."
[2] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."
[3] "Clearly, the error bars on the dehydrogenation barriers expand as large as 0.20.3 eV, corresponding to about 23 orders of magnitude on the predicted rate constants."
[4] "Our calculated Pt3X values (points in Fig. 3) are almost on the fitted curve, indicating that the errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable."
[5] "The first dehydrogenation step was found to be the rate-controlling step on most of the facets."

1. Linear scaling relationships, such as BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationships and scaling the relationship between adsorption energies of surface intermediates/transition states, can map reaction rates and product selectivity from a high-dimensional space to a simple descriptor space.

2. The addition of In shifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms, decreasing the binding strength of propylene and promoting its desorption, which results in higher propylene selectivity.

3. The intrinsic errors in functionals, particularly those at the GGA level DFT calculations, can lead to errors as large as 0.2 eV, corresponding to about 23 orders of magnitude on the predicted rate constants.

4. The errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable, as evidenced by the Pt3X values being close to the fitted curve in Figure 3.

5. The first dehydrogenation step is often identified as the rate-controlling step across various facets during the PDH reaction.

1. 线性缩放关系，如BrnstedEvansPolanyi关系和表面中间体/过渡态吸附能之间的缩放关系，可以将反应速率和产物选择性从包含所有基本步骤信息的高维空间映射到一个简单的描述符空间。

2. 添加In向下移动表面Pt原子的d带中心，降低了丙烯的结合强度并促进了其脱附，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。

3. 功能性的内在误差，特别是GGA水平DFT计算中的误差，可能导致高达0.2 eV的误差，对应于预测速率常数约23个数量级的差异。

4. 缩放关系引入的误差是可接受的，因为Pt3X值接近图3中拟合曲线，表明缩放关系带来的误差是可以接受的。

5. 大多数晶面上的第一脱氢化步骤通常被识别为控制步骤。
