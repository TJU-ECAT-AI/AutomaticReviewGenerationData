[1] "Considering DFT uncertainty, Pt3In was found to have an activity comparable to that of pure Pt and Pt3Sn."
[2] "Meanwhile, Pt3In shows a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity compared with pure Pt."
[3] "The first dehydrogenation step was found to be the rate-controlling step on most of the facets."
[4] "The role of In can also be attributed to an apparently increasing electron transfer from In to Pt."
[5] "The adsorption energies of propylene that play a key role in selectivity and activity were correlated with the d-band center, which can be used to tune a more precise PtIn ratio for the PDH reaction in the future."

The study identified a bimetallic alloy, Pt3In, as an optimal catalyst for the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. It demonstrated that Pt3In has comparable activity to pure Pt and Pt3Sn, but shows significant enhancement in propylene selectivity compared to pure Pt. The first dehydrogenation step was identified as the rate-controlling step across most facets. The addition of In in the alloy was found to facilitate electron transfer from In to Pt, affecting the adsorption energy of propylene, which is crucial for selectivity and activity. The d-band center was found to correlate with the propylene π adsorption energy, suggesting it could be used to fine-tune the PtIn ratio for PDH reactions.

研究发现，合金Pt3In是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的理想催化剂。它证明了Pt3In的活性与纯Pt和Pt3Sn相当，但与纯Pt相比，丙烯选择性有显著提高。被识别为控制速率步骤的第一脱氢化步骤在大多数晶面中都存在。In的加入促进了从In到Pt的电子转移，影响了丙烯的吸附能，这对于选择性和活性至关重要。发现d带中心与丙烯π吸附能相关，这意味着它可以用来精确调整PtIn比例以适应PDH反应。
