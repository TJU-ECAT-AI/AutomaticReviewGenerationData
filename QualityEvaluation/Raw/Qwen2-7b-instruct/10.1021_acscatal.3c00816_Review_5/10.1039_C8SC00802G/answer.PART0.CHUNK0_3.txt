1. The Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) generates an ensemble of variations around the prediction to assess the reliability of the screening results. The error bars for dehydrogenation barriers can expand up to 0.20.3 eV, corresponding to about 23 orders of magnitude on the predicted rate constants.

2. In Fig. 3, a criterion is set where YPt3X < YPt < 0.2 and kPt3X > kPt × 0.1, meaning that Pt3X shows better selectivity and acceptable activity.

3. The scaling relationships between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and propylene desorption free energy barrier, and between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and further dehydrogenation free energy barrier, still hold for the 2000 sets of data in the BEEF error ensemble.

4. The free energy barriers of the first dehydrogenation step for Pt(211), Pt3In(211)_Pt, and Pt3In(211)_In are nearly identical, as shown in Fig. 5a.

5. The first dehydrogenation step was identified as the rate-controlling step across most of the facets.

1. 最近开发的贝叶斯误差估计功能与范德华相关（BEEF-vdW）会生成围绕预测的大量变体集合，用于评估筛选结果的可靠性。脱氢化壁垒的误差条可以扩展到0.20.3 eV，对应于大约23个数量级的预测速率常数。

2. 在图3中，设置了一个标准：YPt3X < YPt < 0.2和kPt3X > kPt × 0.1，这意味着Pt3X具有更好的选择性和可接受的活性。

3. 脱氢化第一步自由能壁垒与丙烯脱附自由能壁垒之间的比例关系，以及脱氢化第一步自由能壁垒与进一步脱氢化自由能壁垒之间的比例关系，在BEEF错误集合的2000组数据中仍然保持稳定。

4. 如图5a所示，对于Pt(211)、Pt3In(211)_Pt和Pt3In(211)_In，第一脱氢化步骤的自由能壁垒几乎相同。

5. 几乎所有晶面的第一脱氢化步骤被识别为控制步骤。
