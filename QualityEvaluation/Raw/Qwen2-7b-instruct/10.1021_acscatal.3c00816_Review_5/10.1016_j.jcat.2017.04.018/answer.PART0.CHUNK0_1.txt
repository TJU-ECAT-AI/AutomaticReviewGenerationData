Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. They are synthesized through specific methods that incorporate both pore sizes to improve the efficiency of the reactions. The thick walls and short channel length of hierarchical zeolites ensure good thermal stability and fast product diffusion. Additionally, their weak acidity promotes the rapid release of olefins, minimizing unwanted secondary reactions. In the study, Sn-containing HMS samples were synthesized with varying SnO2 contents (2, 5, and 10 wt%) and reduced in H2 flow before use in the PDH reactions.

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过特定的方法结合两种孔径大小，以提高反应效率。层状沸石的厚壁和短通道长度确保了良好的热稳定性和快速的产品扩散。此外，其较弱的酸性促进了烯烃的快速释放，减少了不必要的副反应的发生。在研究中，合成了含有不同SnO2含量（2、5和10 wt%）的Sn-含HMS样品，并在H2流中进行还原，然后用于PDH反应。
