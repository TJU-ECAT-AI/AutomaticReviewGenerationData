[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) [15] ,[16] and short channel length [17] of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K [18] and fast diffusion of products, respectively."
[4] "Moreover, its weak acidity [19] facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

Hierarchical zeolites, such as hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface areas and large internal volumes. This structure allows for efficient diffusion of reactants and products while maintaining thermal stability. The synthesis methods typically involve templating agents to create ordered mesopores within the zeolite framework. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites like HMS often show improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore architecture, which facilitates faster diffusion rates and more effective separation of products, leading to increased conversion efficiency and stability under reaction conditions.

层级沸石，例如六方介孔二氧化硅（HMS），通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，为PDH反应提供增强的可访问性。这种结构既提供了高的比表面积，又具有大的内部体积，这使得反应物和产物能够高效扩散，同时保持热稳定性。合成方法通常涉及模板剂来在沸石骨架中创建有序的介孔。与传统沸石相比，像HMS这样的层级沸石在PDH反应中的性能往往更好，因为其增强的孔结构能够促进更快的扩散速率和更有效的产物分离，从而提高转化效率和在反应条件下的稳定性。
