[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "XRD, HRTEM and XPS characterizations jointly evidence that, the Sn species are probably embedded into the lattice of HMS bulk at a relatively low Sn loading amount."
[3] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[4] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[5] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[6] "The thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively."
[7] "Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, allowing for more efficient and direct contact between reactants and active sites. The synthesis methods typically involve the creation of these materials through processes such as hydrothermal synthesis or sol-gel processing. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a larger surface area and better pore size distribution, which increases the reactivity and stability of the catalyst. This results in higher conversion rates and better selectivity towards desired products.

2. The thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) and short channel length of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) contribute to its excellent thermal stability up to 1073 K and facilitate fast diffusion of products. Additionally, the weak acidity of HMS enables prompt desorption of olefins, minimizing the occurrence of unwanted side reactions. This combination of properties leads to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions, particularly in terms of stability and efficiency.

1. 多级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，增强了PDH反应的通达性，使得反应物与活性位点之间更高效的接触。这些材料的合成方法通常包括热液合成或溶胶-凝胶过程等。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供更大的比表面积和更好的孔径分布，提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性，从而导致更高的转化率和更好的产物选择性。

2. 六方介孔硅（HMS）的厚壁（2.0-3.0纳米）和短通道长度使其在高达1073K的温度下具有出色的热稳定性，并促进产品的快速扩散。此外，HMS的弱酸性使烯烃迅速脱附，最大限度地减少了不期望的副反应的发生。这种结合的特性导致了PDH反应中催化剂性能的改进，特别是在稳定性和效率方面。

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. They are synthesized through specific methods that incorporate both pore sizes to improve the efficiency of the reactions. The thick walls and short channel length of hierarchical zeolites ensure good thermal stability and fast product diffusion. Additionally, their weak acidity promotes the rapid release of olefins, minimizing unwanted secondary reactions. In the study, Sn-containing HMS samples were synthesized with varying SnO2 contents (2, 5, and 10 wt%) and reduced in H2 flow before use in the PDH reactions.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and faster diffusion pathways for reactants and products. This allows for more efficient contact between the reactants and the active sites, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. The main types of these materials are hexagonal mesoporous silicas (HMS), characterized by their thick walls and short channel lengths which ensure good thermal stability and rapid product diffusion. The synthesis methods typically involve the facile preparation of HMS through specific techniques such as sol-gel processes or template-directed methods. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by offering better stability and selectivity, especially when used as supports for metal catalysts like Sn, which can act as both active components and promoters. The enhanced stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the metal species and the HMS substrate, preventing the migration and removal of low-melting-point metallic species.

Hierarchical zeolites, such as hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface areas and large internal volumes. This structure allows for efficient diffusion of reactants and products while maintaining thermal stability. The synthesis methods typically involve templating agents to create ordered mesopores within the zeolite framework. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites like HMS often show improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore architecture, which facilitates faster diffusion rates and more effective separation of products, leading to increased conversion efficiency and stability under reaction conditions.
