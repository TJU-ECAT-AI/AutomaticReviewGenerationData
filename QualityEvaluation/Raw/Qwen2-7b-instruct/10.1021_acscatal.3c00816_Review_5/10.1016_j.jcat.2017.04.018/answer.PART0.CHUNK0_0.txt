[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "XRD, HRTEM and XPS characterizations jointly evidence that, the Sn species are probably embedded into the lattice of HMS bulk at a relatively low Sn loading amount."
[3] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[4] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[5] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[6] "The thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively."
[7] "Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, allowing for more efficient and direct contact between reactants and active sites. The synthesis methods typically involve the creation of these materials through processes such as hydrothermal synthesis or sol-gel processing. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a larger surface area and better pore size distribution, which increases the reactivity and stability of the catalyst. This results in higher conversion rates and better selectivity towards desired products.

2. The thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) and short channel length of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) contribute to its excellent thermal stability up to 1073 K and facilitate fast diffusion of products. Additionally, the weak acidity of HMS enables prompt desorption of olefins, minimizing the occurrence of unwanted side reactions. This combination of properties leads to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions, particularly in terms of stability and efficiency.

1. 多级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，增强了PDH反应的通达性，使得反应物与活性位点之间更高效的接触。这些材料的合成方法通常包括热液合成或溶胶-凝胶过程等。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供更大的比表面积和更好的孔径分布，提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性，从而导致更高的转化率和更好的产物选择性。

2. 六方介孔硅（HMS）的厚壁（2.0-3.0纳米）和短通道长度使其在高达1073K的温度下具有出色的热稳定性，并促进产品的快速扩散。此外，HMS的弱酸性使烯烃迅速脱附，最大限度地减少了不期望的副反应的发生。这种结合的特性导致了PDH反应中催化剂性能的改进，特别是在稳定性和效率方面。
