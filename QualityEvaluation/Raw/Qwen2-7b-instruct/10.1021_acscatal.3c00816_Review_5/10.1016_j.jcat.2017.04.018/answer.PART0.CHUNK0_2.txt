[1] "In this work, a series of Sn-containing HMS samples with SnO2 content of 2, 5 and 10 wt%, has been synthesized and reduced in H2 flow prior to reaction (experimental details are given in the"
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The enhanced stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "Further, the reaction route of propane dehydrogenation over Sn-HMS catalyst has been proposed."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and faster diffusion pathways for reactants and products. This allows for more efficient contact between the reactants and the active sites, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. The main types of these materials are hexagonal mesoporous silicas (HMS), characterized by their thick walls and short channel lengths which ensure good thermal stability and rapid product diffusion. The synthesis methods typically involve the facile preparation of HMS through specific techniques such as sol-gel processes or template-directed methods. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by offering better stability and selectivity, especially when used as supports for metal catalysts like Sn, which can act as both active components and promoters. The enhanced stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the metal species and the HMS substrate, preventing the migration and removal of low-melting-point metallic species.

层级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的表面积和更快的反应物和产物扩散路径来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这使得活性中心与反应物之间的有效接触更加高效，从而提高催化活性和选择性。这些材料的主要类型是六方介孔硅（HMS），其特征在于厚壁和短通道长度，确保了良好的热稳定性以及快速的产品扩散。合成方法通常包括特定技术，如溶胶-凝胶过程或模板导向方法来制备HMS。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在金属催化剂（如Sn）的支撑下改善PDH反应性能，尤其表现出更好的稳定性和选择性。增强的稳定性归因于金属物种与HMS基体之间强烈的相互作用，防止了低熔点金属物种的迁移和移除。
