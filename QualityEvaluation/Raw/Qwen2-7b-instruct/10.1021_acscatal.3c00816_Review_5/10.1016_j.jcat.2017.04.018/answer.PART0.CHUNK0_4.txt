1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, improving reactivity and selectivity.
2. The hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) used in this study has thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) and a short channel length (17), providing good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast product diffusion.
3. The weak acidity of HMS facilitates the prompt desorption of olefins, minimizing secondary reactions and enhancing the efficiency of PDH reactions.
4. The synthesis involves creating Sn-containing HMS samples with varying SnO2 contents (2, 5, and 10 wt%), which are then reduced in H2 flow before use in the PDH reaction.
