[1] "The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites."
[2] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and better pore connectivity. This allows for easier diffusion of reactants and products, improving the overall efficiency of the PDH process. There are two main types of hierarchical zeolites: those with a combination of micropores and mesopores, and those with a mix of micropores and macropores. Synthesis methods typically involve modifying the synthesis conditions to promote the formation of these dual-porosity structures, such as using templating agents, controlling the reaction temperature and time, and adjusting the molar ratios of reactants. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites significantly improve the performance of PDH reactions by enhancing the catalytic activity and stability, reducing the activation energy, and allowing for faster kinetics due to their enhanced pore network.

The ultrafast encapsulation technique described in the document addresses the mismatch in time scales between the formation of metal nanoclusters and the crystallization of zeolites, enabling an efficient and rapid encapsulation process. This is achieved by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the formation of the metal nanoclusters. The encapsulated catalysts, such as the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5, exhibit exceptional activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The study also investigates how the synthesis temperature influences the interplay between zeolite crystallization and nanocluster formation, demonstrating that adjusting the temperature can control the encapsulation process and optimize the catalyst properties.

层状沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，增强PDH反应的可访问性，提供了更大的表面积和更好的孔隙连通性。这使得反应物和产物更容易扩散，从而提高了PDH过程的整体效率。层状沸石主要有两种类型：结合微孔和介孔的，以及结合微孔和大孔的。合成方法通常涉及调整合成条件以促进这些双重孔结构的形成，例如使用模板剂、控制反应温度和时间，以及调整反应物的摩尔比。与传统沸石相比，层状沸石显著提高了PDH反应的性能，通过增强催化活性和稳定性、降低活化能和允许更快的动力学，由于其增强的孔网络结构。

文档中描述的超快速封装技术解决了金属纳米簇形成时间和沸石结晶之间的匹配问题，实现了高效快速的封装过程。通过加快沸石的结晶来使与金属纳米簇的形成同步实现这一目标。封装催化剂，如Pt/Sn-ZSM-5，表现出在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的出色活性和稳定性。研究还探讨了合成温度如何影响沸石结晶和纳米簇形成的相互作用，证明了可以通过调整温度来控制封装过程并优化催化剂性能。
