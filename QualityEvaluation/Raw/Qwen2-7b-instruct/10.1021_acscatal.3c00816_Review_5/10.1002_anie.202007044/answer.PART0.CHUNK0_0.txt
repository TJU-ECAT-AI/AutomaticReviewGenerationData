Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reactants to interact with the catalyst. The main types of these materials include ZSM-5, BEA, and ERI zeolites, which are synthesized through hydrothermal synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve PDH reactions' performance by offering better selectivity and stability, which are critical factors in industrial applications. The addition of Sn plays a crucial role in regulating the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters, leading to enhanced catalytic properties. The synthesis temperature does not significantly affect the states of Pt and Sn species, as evidenced by the UV-vis spectra. The encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites demonstrate excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, making them a promising catalyst for industrial use.

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的反应物与催化剂相互作用的表面积来增强PDH反应的可访问性。这些材料的主要类型包括ZSM-5、BEA和ERI沸石，它们通过水热合成进行合成。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在PDH反应性能方面表现出更好的选择性和稳定性，这是工业应用中至关重要的因素。Sn的添加对调节Pt纳米簇的大小和分散起着关键作用，从而导致催化性能的增强。合成温度对Pt和Sn物种的状态影响不大，这从紫外光谱图中可以得到证实。封装的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5沸石显示出在丙烷脱氢为丙烯中的出色稳定性和活性，使其成为有前景的工业催化剂。
