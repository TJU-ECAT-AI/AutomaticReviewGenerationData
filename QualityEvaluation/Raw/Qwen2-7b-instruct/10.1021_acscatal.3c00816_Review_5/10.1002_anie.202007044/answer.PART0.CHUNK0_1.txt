[1] "Overcoming the mismatch between the rapid formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites allows the insitu encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites in just a few minutes."
[2] "The encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites combines the superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials."
[3] "However, the preparation of such bifunctional catalysts is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites."
[4] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."
[5] "The concept was demonstrated by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM-5 (MFI) zeolite in the course of its crystallization, leading to an ultrafast, insitu encapsulation within just 5min."
[6] "This method of ultrafast encapsulation opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity."
[7] "Functional metallic particles, when downsized to a few nanometers or sub-nanometer, can exhibit superior catalytic activity due to unique electronic structure and increased exposure of active sites."
[8] "Various supports have been developed to stabilize the nanoclusters, among which zeolites are most promising thanks to their well-defined, nanoscale frameworks as well as high thermal and chemical stability."
[9] "Encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites enables a synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis that combines superior activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the zeolites."
[10] "However, the fabrication of such metal-nanocluster-encapsulated zeolites is not straightforward. Due to high surface free energy of the metal species, they tend to agglomerate and precipitate very fast, in particular, under harsh conditions of zeolite synthesis (e.g., strong alkalinity and high temperature)."
[11] "Post-synthesis encapsulation can circumvent the mismatching issue in a stepwise manner, where the zeolite synthesis and the introduction of the metal species are carried out in sequence. Nevertheless, this method is not only time-consuming but also restricted to large-pore zeolites whose internal pores/cavities are accessible to metallic precursors."
[12] "In situ encapsulation methods, in which the metal clusters are encapsulated in the course of zeolite crystallization, is more desirable."
[13] "In general, the existing in situ encapsulation methods rely on protective strategies that slow down the formation and the subsequent aggregation of metal clusters so as to synchronize with the zeolite crystallization."
[14] "In addressing the low efficiency of the conventional synthesis of zeolites, our group has established an ultrafast route for zeolite synthesis."
[15] "The ultrafast synthesis of zeolites enabled the establishment of continuous-flow synthesis of zeolites, which could greatly increase the space-time yield of zeolite production."
[16] "We herein report that the ultrafast synthesis of zeolites offers a unique opportunity to address the above-mentioned mismatching issue from a completely different perspective. That is, the crystallization of zeolites can be expedited to accommodate the rapid formation of metal nanocluster, thus enabling an ultrafast in situ encapsulation."
[17] "In this work, we focus on encapsulating Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite to demonstrate the proof of concept. The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."
[18] "The role of Sn is supposed to modulate the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, thus affecting size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."
[19] "Moreover, the high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is of great success."
[20] "As schematically illustrated in Figure1c, the ultrafast in situ encapsulation was achieved through a one-pot synthesis without the addition of any protective agent."
[21] "The ultrafast in situ encapsulation was achieved through a one-pot synthesis without the addition of any protective agent."
[22] "As seen from the TEM image of a Sn-ZSM-5 (FigureS6), the Pt nanoclusters featured adsorption bands at 216nm and 281nm; due to overlapping with the bands from the Sn species, the evolution of Pt speciation cannot be identified from the UV-vis spectra."
[23] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."
[24] "The states of Pt and Sn species, however, were not much affected by the synthesis temperature, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra in FigureS10."
[25] "The effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation was verified by testing the catalytic activities of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."
[26] "After these cycles of reaction and regeneration, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst still featured well-dispersed nanoclusters, as indicated by the TEM images of the used catalyst in FigureS17."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-scale pore network that allows better diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with both microporous and mesoporous or macroporous structures. Synthesis methods for these materials typically involve template-directed synthesis or co-condensation techniques that incorporate both small and larger building blocks. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering enhanced surface area, better thermal stability, and controlled pore sizes that optimize the catalytic activity and selectivity.
