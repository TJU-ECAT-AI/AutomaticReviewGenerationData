[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."
[2] "This method of ultrafast encapsulation opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity."
[3] "In the ultrafast synthesis, a tubular reactor featuring fast heating is used as the reaction vessel, and approaches such as aging and seeding are adopted to address bottlenecks in the crystallization process, the combination of which leads to the synthesis of a class of important zeolites in only several minutes."
[4] "The ultrafast encapsulation was achieved through a one-pot synthesis without the addition of any protective agent."
[5] "The in situ encapsulation was conducted at different temperatures to investigate how the synthesis temperature affects the interplay between zeolite crystallization and nanocluster formation."
[6] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."
[7] "The ultrafast encapsulation was of great success. The catalyst still featured well-dispersed nanoclusters, as indicated by the TEM images of the used catalyst."
[8] "From another point of view, the ultrafast encapsulation foresees a continuous-flow process that further facilitates the preparation of the metal-encapsulated zeolites as a booming class of catalysts."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-scale pore network. The micropores offer a high surface area for active sites, while the mesopores/macropores facilitate easier diffusion of reactants and products. Main types of these materials include MFI, BEA, and ERI zeolites, synthesized through methods such as the use of a tubular reactor with fast heating, aging, and seeding techniques. This approach allows for the synthesis of zeolites in just several minutes. The ultrafast encapsulation method uses a one-pot synthesis without protective agents, enabling the encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites within minutes. The role of tin (Sn) is crucial in regulating the size and dispersion of platinum (Pt) nanoclusters within the zeolite matrix. The catalysts prepared through this method showed excellent stability and activity in PDH reactions, maintaining well-dispersed nanoclusters even after multiple reaction and regeneration cycles. The concept of ultrafast encapsulation foresees a continuous-flow process that can further facilitate the preparation of metal-encapsulated zeolites as a booming class of catalysts.

层次型沸石通过提供多尺度孔网络来增强PDH反应的可访问性，结合微孔和介孔/大孔。微孔提供了活性位点的高比表面积，而介孔/大孔则有利于反应物和产物的更容易扩散。这些材料的主要类型包括MFI、BEA和ERI沸石，通过使用具有快速加热的管式反应器、老化和种子技术等方法合成。这种方法允许在几分钟内合成沸石。超快速封装方法使用一次性合成法，不添加任何保护剂，能够在几分钟内将金属纳米簇封装到沸石中。锡（Sn）的作用是关键的，在调节铂（Pt）纳米簇在沸石基质中的大小和分散方面至关重要。通过这种方法制备的催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优异的稳定性和活性，即使在多次反应和再生循环后，仍能保持分散良好的纳米簇。超快速封装的概念预见了一个连续流过程，这将进一步促进金属封装沸石类催化剂的制备。
