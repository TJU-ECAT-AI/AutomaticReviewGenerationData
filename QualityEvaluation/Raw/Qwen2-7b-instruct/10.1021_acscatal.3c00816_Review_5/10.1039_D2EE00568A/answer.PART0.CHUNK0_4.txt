[1] "Olefins are important precursors to materials such as plastics, rubbers, lubricants, surfactants and detergents."
[2] "As demand for the materials above are growing, improvements in the processes and catalysts used for olefin production are of interest, aimed to lower the cost and energy intensity of olefin production."
[3] "One such method is the use of membrane reactors, which can remove hydrogen from the reactor, enabling higher single-pass conversions."
[4] "These results demonstrate that while higher conversions are achievable, coking reactions are also accelerated under conditions with higher olefin and lower hydrogen partial pressures."
[5] "This work provides an experimental framework to test new catalytic materials for applications where hydrogen-deficient conditions are expected."

The hierarchical zeolites discussed in the document combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and improved pore size distribution. This allows for better adsorption and diffusion of reactants, improving the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The main types of these materials include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized through various methods such as sol-gel, template-directed synthesis, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating faster and more efficient conversion of feedstocks, leading to higher yields and purity of products. Compared to traditional zeolites, the enhanced pore structure and accessibility in hierarchical zeolites enable better control over reaction kinetics and product selectivity, making them suitable for a wider range of PDH applications.
