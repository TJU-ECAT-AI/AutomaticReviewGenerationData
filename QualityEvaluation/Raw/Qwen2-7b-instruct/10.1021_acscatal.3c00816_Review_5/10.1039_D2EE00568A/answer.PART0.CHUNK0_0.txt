[1] "Catalytic limitations on alkane dehydrogenation under H2 deficient conditions relevant to membrane reactors Ethane dehydrogenation, a reaction that converts ethane to ethylene and H2, is an equilibrium limited reaction, typically practiced at high temperature and low pressure in order to favor higher ethylene yields."
[2] "Membrane reactors have been developed to remove H2 through the membrane walls, thereby changing the thermodynamically achievable ethylene yields as a function of H2 removal, possibly allowing for lower temperature and higher pressure reactor conditions to be realized."
[3] "The experiments were carried out using a highly active and selective dehydrogenation catalyst, PtSn-K/MFI. The results demonstrate that equilibrium conversion for ethane dehydrogenation is achievable at 600 C and 1 atm on PtSnK/MFI. However, upon simulating H2-removal conditions, the new equilibrium conversions were not achievable."
[4] "Coking reactions lead to deactivation of the catalyst, and these coking reactions are accelerated by H2 removal. Moreover, prior to significant catalyst deactivation, the dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coke produce additional H2, which further limit ethylene yields due to re-hydrogenation of ethylene."
[5] "These results demonstrate that while higher conversions are achievable, coking reactions are also accelerated under conditions with higher olefin and lower hydrogen partial pressures. Coking not only accelerates unwanted catalyst deactivation, but it also limits olefin yields due to the concomitant hydrogen byproduct produced during coke formation."
[6] "The thermodynamic impact of excess H2 production from coke can be estimated, by assuming ethylene conversion to coke and two equivalents of H2 (Fig. S5, ESI), and indeed shows that increased H2 will limit ethylene yields and at some point, can cause ethylene hydrogenation to ethane to occur."
[7] "Physical evidence for coke formation is provided by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) of the spent catalyst sample, producing CO2 during the oxidative study (Fig. S6, ESI), a combustion product from coke and O2. Additionally, the sample is dark black after the EDH catalysis, indicative of coke formation, and white after TPO, indicative of coke combustion."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactants to interact with the catalyst. This structure allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, improving the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The main types of these materials include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), mesoporous silicas, and ordered mesoporous materials (OMMs). Synthesis methods vary depending on the type of material but generally involve techniques such as sol-gel, template-directed synthesis, and microwave-assisted synthesis. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by facilitating faster reaction kinetics, enhancing selectivity towards desired products, and reducing the risk of catalyst deactivation through mechanisms such as coke formation.

The hierarchical zeolites' enhanced performance compared to traditional zeolites stems from their ability to optimize pore size distribution, which is crucial for the efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. The micropores provide sites for adsorption, while the mesopores/macropores ensure efficient mass transport and allow for easier product release. This combination of features minimizes the diffusion limitations often encountered in traditional zeolites, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability under PDH reaction conditions.
