The hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. They can be synthesized through sol-gel, template-assisted, and hydrothermal methods. These materials enhance PDH reaction performance by offering a larger surface area and improved pore structure, thus facilitating more effective and selective catalysis.
