[1] "Olefins are important precursors to materials such as plastics, rubbers, lubricants, surfactants and detergents."
[2] "One method of olefin production is via alkane dehydrogenation, which is a class of reaction that converts alkanes to olefins and H2, and is practiced industrially on large scale."
[3] "The ability of a membrane reactor to selectively transport H2 through its walls increases the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion (Xeq) for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "However, upon simulating H2-removal conditions, the new equilibrium conversions were not achievable."
[5] "The inability to obtain the new equilibrium conversions at simulated H2 removal is due to, in part, deleterious reactions, most notably coking."
[6] "Coking reactions lead to deactivation of the catalyst, and these coking reactions are accelerated by H2 removal."
[7] "Moreover, prior to significant catalyst deactivation, the dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coke produce additional H2, which further limit ethylene yields due to re-hydrogenation of ethylene."

The document discusses the impact of hydrogen removal on dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly focusing on ethane dehydrogenation. It explains that while hydrogen removal can increase the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion (Xeq) for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, it also accelerates coking reactions, leading to catalyst deactivation. Coked catalysts not only deactivate but also produce additional hydrogen, which limits ethylene yields by re-hydrogenating ethylene. Therefore, achieving the increased Xeq predicted by hydrogen removal requires careful consideration of the catalytic materials and process conditions, as the substantial effect of hydrogen removal on coking reactions limits achievable yields.

文档讨论了氢气去除对脱氢催化剂的影响，特别是针对乙烷脱氢。它解释说，虽然氢气去除可以增加烷烃脱氢反应的热力学平衡转化率（Xeq），但它也会加速焦化反应，导致催化剂失活。焦化的催化剂不仅失活，还会产生额外的氢气，这通过重新氢化乙烯进一步限制乙烯产量。因此，要实现氢气去除预测的增加的Xeq，需要仔细考虑催化材料和工艺条件，因为氢气去除对焦化反应的影响限制了可实现的产率。
