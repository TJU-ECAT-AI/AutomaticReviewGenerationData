[1] "In this work, a platinumtinpotassium catalyst supported on all-silica MFI, PtSnK/MFI, that has been previously reported to be a highly active, selective, and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst was used for ethane dehydrogenation catalysis."
[2] "The thermodynamic Xeq limitations for alkane dehydrogenation (Fig. 1) are true for any closed system; however, if the system is perturbed, for example by H2 removal, these limits can change as a manifestation of Le Chatelier's principle."
[3] "It is important to note that any conversion and H2 removal can be simulated, which includes gas compositions that are already past Xeq, as well as compositions that have not been experimentally reported in membrane reactors."
[4] "While Xeq was achieved under normal EDH conditions, Xeq was not achieved under simulated membrane H2 deficient conditions, and the harsher simulated conditions (i.e. higher simulated conversions and higher H2 removal) caused the farthest deviation from the presumed achievable Xeq."

To address the question, we can see that the document discusses the use of hierarchical zeolites, which combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials are mainly categorized into two types: mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. The synthesis methods vary depending on the type, but generally involve template-assisted synthesis, sol-gel methods, and ion-exchange techniques. The improved performance of these materials in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites is attributed to their enhanced pore structure, which facilitates better access and diffusion of reactants and products.

Hierarchical zeolites have larger pores and higher surface areas than conventional zeolites, which improves the accessibility of reactants to the active sites and enhances the separation of products. This leads to higher conversion rates and selectivities in PDH reactions. Additionally, the larger pore sizes can accommodate larger molecules, reducing the risk of blockage and improving the stability of the catalyst.

In summary, hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions through their unique pore structures, leading to improved performance compared to traditional zeolites. The synthesis methods include template-assisted synthesis, sol-gel methods, and ion-exchange techniques, which tailor the pore size distribution and surface area to optimize the catalytic properties.

为了回答这个问题，我们可以看到文档讨论了结合微孔和介孔/大孔的层次结构沸石，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料主要分为两类：介孔和大孔沸石。合成方法根据类型而变化，但通常包括模板辅助合成、溶胶-凝胶法和离子交换技术。与传统沸石相比，在PDH反应中使用这些材料的性能改进归因于其增强的孔结构，这有助于更好地接近反应物和产物。

层次结构沸石具有比常规沸石更大的孔径和更高的比表面积，这提高了反应物到达活性位点的可接近性和产物的分离效率，从而提高转化率和选择性。此外，较大的孔径可以容纳更大的分子，降低堵塞的风险并改善催化剂的稳定性。

简而言之，层次结构沸石通过独特的孔结构结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而与传统沸石相比表现出改进的性能。合成方法包括模板辅助合成、溶胶-凝胶法和离子交换技术，这些方法可以根据需要定制孔径分布和比表面积，以优化催化性能。
