          [1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include H-ZSM-5, H-USY, and H-MOR."
          [3] "These materials are synthesized through hydrothermal treatments, template-directed synthesis, and sol-gel processes."
          [4] "Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore structure and accessibility."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          Answer: Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. The key types of hierarchical zeolites are H-ZSM-5, H-USY, and H-MOR. These materials are produced via hydrothermal treatments, template-directed synthesis, and sol-gel processes. Hierarchical zeolites outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reactions due to their improved pore structure and accessibility.
