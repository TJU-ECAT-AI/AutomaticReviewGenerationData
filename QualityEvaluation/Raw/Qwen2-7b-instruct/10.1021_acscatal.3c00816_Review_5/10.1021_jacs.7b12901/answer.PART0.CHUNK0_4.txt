1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials are MFI, MEL, and BEA structures. They are synthesized using hydrothermal processes, template-directed synthesis, or sol-gel methods. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites exhibit enhanced surface area, superior thermal stability, and increased catalytic efficiency for PDH reactions.
