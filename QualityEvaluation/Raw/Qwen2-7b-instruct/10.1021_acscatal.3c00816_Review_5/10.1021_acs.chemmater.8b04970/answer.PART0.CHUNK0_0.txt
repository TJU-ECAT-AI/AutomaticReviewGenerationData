Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions through their unique pore architecture. The main types of these materials include single-crystal house-of-cards-like ZSM-5, which are synthesized via hydrothermal synthesis and template-directed assembly. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites exhibit improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore structure and increased surface area.
