          [1] "The combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical zeolites enhances accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include single-crystal house-of-cards-like ZSM-5."
          [3] "Synthesis methods for these materials involve hydrothermal synthesis and template-directed assembly."
          [4] "Improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites is attributed to enhanced pore structure and increased surface area."

      <English>
          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, mainly through the inclusion of single-crystal house-of-cards-like ZSM-5. These materials are synthesized using hydrothermal processes or template-directed assembly, leading to enhanced pore structure and increased surface area, thus improving PDH reaction performance over traditional zeolites.
