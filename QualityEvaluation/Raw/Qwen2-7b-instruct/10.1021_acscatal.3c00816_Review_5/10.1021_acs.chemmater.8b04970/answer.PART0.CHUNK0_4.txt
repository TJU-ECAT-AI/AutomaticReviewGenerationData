Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more efficient pore structure. The main types include single-crystal house-of-cards-like ZSM-5, which are synthesized through hydrothermal processes or template-directed methods. These materials significantly improve the performance of PDH reactions, offering better selectivity and yield compared to traditional zeolites.
