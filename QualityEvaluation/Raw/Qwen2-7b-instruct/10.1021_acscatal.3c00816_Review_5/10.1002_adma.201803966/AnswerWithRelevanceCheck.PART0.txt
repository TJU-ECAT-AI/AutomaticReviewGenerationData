         <quote>These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures.</quote>
         <quote>In the future, this synthetic strategy may be a promising route for the designed synthesis of small MNPs with controllable particle size through adjustment of the hierarchical structures.</quote>

         1. Hierarchical zeolites utilize the shape selectivity of micropores and the transport efficiency of mesoporous materials to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The mesopores function as nanoscale spaces for small metal nanoparticles (MNPs), effectively limiting their free movement and preventing severe sintering at high temperatures. This synthetic approach might enable the design of small MNPs with controllable particle sizes through modifications to the hierarchical structures.

         <quote>Significantly, compared with other crystalline nanoporous materials, zeolites exhibit superior thermal and chemical stability even under harsh reaction conditions. Thus far, zeolites have proven to be excellent supports for the confinement synthesis of metal species against aggregation.</quote>
         <quote>Compared with the synthesis of zeolite-supported noble metals, the encapsulation of small transition-metal clusters inside the zeolites is still difficult to be achieved because the transition-metal clusters possess lower redox potential and higher surface free energy than noble-metal clusters, leading to easy and severe aggregations during the reduction process.</quote>
         <quote>In the present progress report, we mainly focus on presenting the state-of-the-art strategies for the fabrication of ultrasmall MNPs, clusters, and even single atoms confined within zeolites and MOFs; the advantages and disadvantages of different methods are also discussed.</quote>
         <quote>The encapsulation of metal clusters within the zeolite framework during the in situ synthetic process is not restricted by the pore size of zeolites because the encapsulating procedure of metal species is synchronized with the crystallization of the zeolites.</quote>
         <quote>Notably, the obtained hollow-metal-encaged zeolite catalysts exhibited excellent shape-selective performance in oxidation and reduction reactions over different substrates with various molecular sizes and configurations, and the micropores of the zeolite shells could block the entrance of toxic molecules to avoid poisoning of the metallic active sites.</quote>
         <quote>With this method, the metal clusters can be encapsulated in MOF shells rather than in the cavities of the MOF structure, which can restrict the breakage of the MOF frameworks. Moreover, the size, composition, and configuration of encapsulated metal clusters can also be controlled according to practical needs.</quote>

         2. Zeolites demonstrate superior thermal and chemical stability compared to other crystalline nanoporous materials, even under harsh reaction conditions. They excel in containing metal species against aggregation. Synthesizing noble metals on zeolites is easier than encapsulating small transition-metal clusters, which have lower redox potential and higher surface free energy, leading to aggregation issues during reduction. This report highlights advanced techniques for fabricating ultrasmall metal nanoparticles, clusters, and even single atoms within zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), along with a discussion on the pros and cons of various methods. The encapsulation of metal clusters within the zeolite framework is not limited by the zeolite's pore size since the metal encapsulation process aligns with zeolite crystallization. Hollow metal-encaged zeolite catalysts show excellent shape-selective performance in oxidation and reduction reactions across different substrates with varying molecular sizes and configurations. Micropores in the zeolite shells prevent toxic molecules from entering, safeguarding the metallic active sites. This method allows metal clusters to be encapsulated within MOF shells, avoiding the breakdown of MOF structures and enabling control over cluster size, composition, and configuration based on practical requirements.
