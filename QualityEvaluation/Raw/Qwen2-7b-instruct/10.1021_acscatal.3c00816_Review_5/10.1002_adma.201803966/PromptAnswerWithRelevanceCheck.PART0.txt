<p>These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures.</p>
<p>In the future, this synthetic strategy may be a promising route for the designed synthesis of small MNPs with controllable particle size through adjustment of the hierarchical structures.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by utilizing the shape selectivity of micropores and the transport efficiency of mesopores/macropores. The mesopores act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, which restrains the free migration of metal species and prevents severe sintering at high temperatures. This synthetic strategy allows for the design of small MNPs with controllable particle sizes through adjustments to the hierarchical structures of the zeolites.

<p>Significantly, compared with other crystalline nanoporous materials, zeolites exhibit superior thermal and chemical stability even under harsh reaction conditions. Thus far, zeolites have proven to be excellent supports for the confinement synthesis of metal species against aggregation.</p>
<p>Compared with the synthesis of zeolite-supported noble metals, the encapsulation of small transition-metal clusters inside the zeolites is still difficult to be achieved because the transition-metal clusters possess lower redox potential and higher surface free energy than noble-metal clusters, leading to easy and severe aggregations during the reduction process.</p>
<p>In the present progress report, we mainly focus on presenting the state-of-the-art strategies for the fabrication of ultrasmall MNPs (<5 nm), clusters, and even single atoms confined within zeolites and MOFs; the advantages and disadvantages of different methods are also discussed.</p>
<p>The encapsulation of metal clusters within the zeolite framework during the in situ synthetic process is not restricted by the pore size of zeolites because the encapsulating procedure of metal species is synchronized with the crystallization of the zeolites.</p>
<p>Notably, the obtained hollow-metal-encaged zeolite catalysts exhibited excellent shape-selective performance in oxidation and reduction reactions over different substrates with various molecular sizes and configurations, and the micropores of the zeolite shells could block the entrance of toxic molecules to avoid poisoning of the metallic active sites.</p>
<p>With this method, the metal clusters can be encapsulated in MOF shells rather than in the cavities of the MOF structure, which can restrict the breakage of the MOF frameworks. Moreover, the size, composition, and configuration of encapsulated metal clusters can also be controlled according to practical needs.</p>
<p>In the future, this synthetic strategy may be a promising route for the designed synthesis of small MNPs with controllable particle size through adjustment of the hierarchical structures.</p>

[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials."
[2] "In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."
[3] "However, considering the great advantages of both single-atom and hybrid multimetallic catalysts, the fabrication of individual hybrid atoms supported nanoporous catalysts seems more attractive, and the excellent performance is also expected from these catalysts with more accessible multicomponent active sites."

1. Recent studies have primarily concentrated on synthesizing ultrasmall noble metal nanoparticles (MNPs) such as gold (Au), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), ruthenium (Ru), and rhodium (Rh) immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. 
2. In contrast, there are fewer reports on ultrasmall non-noble metal MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials because non-noble MNPs tend to be more active, aggregate easily, and grow larger under reaction and reduction conditions. 
3. However, considering the benefits of both single-atom and hybrid multimetallic catalysts, the creation of individual hybrid atoms supported on nanoporous catalysts appears more promising. These catalysts are expected to perform excellently due to the availability of multiple active sites.
