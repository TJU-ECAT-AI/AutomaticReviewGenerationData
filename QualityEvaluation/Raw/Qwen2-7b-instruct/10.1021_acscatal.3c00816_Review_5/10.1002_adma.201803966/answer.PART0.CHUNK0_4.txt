[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials."
[2] "In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."
[3] "However, considering the great advantages of both single-atom and hybrid multimetallic catalysts, the fabrication of individual hybrid atoms supported nanoporous catalysts seems more attractive, and the excellent performance is also expected from these catalysts with more accessible multicomponent active sites."

1. Recent studies have primarily concentrated on synthesizing ultrasmall noble metal nanoparticles (MNPs) such as gold (Au), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), ruthenium (Ru), and rhodium (Rh) immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. 
2. In contrast, there are fewer reports on ultrasmall non-noble metal MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials because non-noble MNPs tend to be more active, aggregate easily, and grow larger under reaction and reduction conditions. 
3. However, considering the benefits of both single-atom and hybrid multimetallic catalysts, the creation of individual hybrid atoms supported on nanoporous catalysts appears more promising. These catalysts are expected to perform excellently due to the availability of multiple active sites.

1. 最近的研究主要集中在利用晶态多孔材料合成超小的贵金属纳米颗粒（例如金、铂、钯、钌和铑）。
2. 相比之下，关于在晶态多孔材料上支持超小非贵金属纳米颗粒的报道较少，因为非贵金属纳米颗粒在反应和还原条件下更容易表现出活性、聚集并增大。
3. 然而，考虑到单原子催化剂和复合多金属催化剂的优点，制备单个复合原子支持的纳米多孔催化剂显得更有吸引力。这些催化剂因其可访问的多重活性位点而预期表现出优异性能。
