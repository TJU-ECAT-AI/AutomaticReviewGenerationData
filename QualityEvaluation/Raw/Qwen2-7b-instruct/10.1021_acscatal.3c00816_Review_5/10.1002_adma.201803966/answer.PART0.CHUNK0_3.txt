[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. This combination allows for better control over the reaction pathways and improves the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH process."
[2] "There are several main types of hierarchical zeolites, including mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and mesoporous-macroporous hybrids. Synthesis methods for these materials often involve templating agents, hydrothermal treatments, and post-synthesis modifications to tune the pore size distribution."
[3] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their tailored pore size distribution. The mesopores and macropores provide pathways for reactant and product diffusion, while the micropores facilitate the catalytic conversion of reactants."

1.Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores, mesopores, and macropores to optimize PDH reaction pathways, enhancing selectivity and efficiency. The combination allows for precise control over reaction mechanisms. 

2.Main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and hybrid materials featuring both mesopores and macropores. Synthesis methods typically involve templating agents, hydrothermal treatments, and post-processing adjustments to fine-tune pore size distributions.

3.Hierarchical zeolites surpass traditional zeolites in PDH reactions due to their customized pore architecture. The mesopores and macropores streamline reactant and product transport, while the micropores support catalytic conversions.
