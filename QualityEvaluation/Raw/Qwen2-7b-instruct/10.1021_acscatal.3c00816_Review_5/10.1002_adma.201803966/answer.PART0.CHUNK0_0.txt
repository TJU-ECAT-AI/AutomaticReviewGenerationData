<p>These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures.</p>
<p>In the future, this synthetic strategy may be a promising route for the designed synthesis of small MNPs with controllable particle size through adjustment of the hierarchical structures.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by utilizing the shape selectivity of micropores and the transport efficiency of mesopores/macropores. The mesopores act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, which restrains the free migration of metal species and prevents severe sintering at high temperatures. This synthetic strategy allows for the design of small MNPs with controllable particle sizes through adjustments to the hierarchical structures of the zeolites.
