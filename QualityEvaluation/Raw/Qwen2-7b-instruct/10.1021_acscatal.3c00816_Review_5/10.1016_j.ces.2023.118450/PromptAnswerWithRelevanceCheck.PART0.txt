1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of these materials include high-silica Beta zeolites like Beta-557. They are synthesized through dealing alumina from the zeolite framework to create a high-silica content. This allows for more surface area and a better arrangement of active sites, thus improving the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

2. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites involves creating a structure that includes both micropores and mesopores/macropores. This is achieved by using zeolite materials with a high silica-to-alumina ratio, such as Beta-557 zeolite. The hierarchical structure enhances the accessibility of the active sites, which is crucial for the PDH reactions.

3. The use of pre-transition metal elements like cerium (Ce) as co-catalysts in PDH catalysts is investigated due to their specific catalytic properties and the simplicity of the regeneration process. These elements help in improving the dispersion of active sites and reducing the reduction temperature.

4. Strategies to improve the dispersion of rare-earth species are limited, but the use of silanol nests and aluminum sites in the zeolite framework can help in achieving this. This synergistic modulation of metal-support interaction leads to the construction of stable PtCe bimetallic clusters, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the PDH reaction.

5. The defect sites derived from silanol nests play a crucial role in dispersing PtCe clusters inside the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite, which improves the catalytic performance of the PDH reaction.

6. Metal-supported high-silica zeolite catalysts, like the PtCe cluster catalysts developed in this study, offer benefits such as high propylene selectivity and longer catalytic longevity, making them suitable for industrial applications in PDH reactions.

1. Hierarchical zeolites, such as Beta-557, integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more open pathways for reactants and products. The Beta-557 zeolite, in particular, features dense silanol nests and trace Al sites that facilitate the dispersion of PtCe clusters, stabilize their structure, and regulate metal-support interactions. This synergy between the hierarchical pore structure and the specific chemical properties of the zeolite improves PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are typically categorized based on their pore size distribution, which includes microporous, mesoporous, and macroporous zeolites. Synthesis methods often involve controlling the template agent, reaction conditions, and the use of surfactants to create the desired pore structure. The Beta-557 zeolite, for example, is synthesized through a post-synthesis dealumination process to enhance its silanol nest density and adjust its SiO2/Al2O3 ratio for optimal catalytic activity in PDH reactions.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites like Beta-557 offer enhanced performance in PDH reactions due to their improved pore structure and chemical functionalities. The larger surface area and more accessible pore network provided by the hierarchical structure enable better dispersion and stabilization of active metal sites, leading to increased catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and longevity. The specific chemical interactions between the metal species (Pt and Ce) and the zeolite framework, facilitated by the silanol nests and Al sites, contribute to the creation of PtCe nanoalloys with superior catalytic properties for PDH reactions.

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple levels of pore size for better reactant diffusion and product separation. The main types of these materials include Beta zeolites, Beta-557, Beta-39, Beta-145, and Beta-200, which differ in their SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. These materials are synthesized through a process involving calcination to remove organic templates, followed by impregnation with metal salts to load the desired metal species. The high-silica Beta zeolites, like Beta-557, offer a unique pore structure that benefits the dispersion of active sites and tuning of metal-support interactions, leading to improved PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites. The incorporation of Al sites in these hierarchical zeolites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and the support, contributing to the stability and longevity of the catalysts.
