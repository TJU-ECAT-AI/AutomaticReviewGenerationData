<p>The defect sites on the surface of the high-silica Beta-557 are responsible for anchoring highly dispersed Ce sites, and furtherly alloying with neighboring Pt atoms to form stable PtCe alloys. On the other hand, the high dispersion of Al sites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and support.</p>
<p>The metal-supported high-silica zeolite catalysts are beneficial to achieving high propylene selectivity and longer catalytic longevity.</p>
<p>A strategy for the synergistic modulation of metal-support interaction by the together utilization of appropriate Al and support-defect sites has been realizing to construct highly dispersed PtCe cluster catalysts for PDH reaction.</p>
<p>The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance of 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity, as well as the robust structure of catalytic sites allow for a low deactivation constant of 0.013 h1.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for adsorption and reaction sites. The main types of these materials include high-silica zeolites, dealuminated zeolites, and bimetallic zeolite catalysts. They are synthesized by modifying the synthesis conditions, such as changing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, using dealumination processes, and introducing co-catalysts. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by enhancing the dispersion of active metal species, reducing coke formation, and maintaining high stability and selectivity over multiple reaction cycles.
