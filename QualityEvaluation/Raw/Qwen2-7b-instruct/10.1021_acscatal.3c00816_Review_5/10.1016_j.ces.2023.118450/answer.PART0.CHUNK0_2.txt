[1] "The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows an excellent catalytic performance of 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity without obvious deactivation (deactivation constant: 0.013 h1)."
[2] "The defect sites on the surface of the high-silica Beta-557 are responsible for anchoring highly dispersed Ce sites, and furtherly alloying with neighboring Pt atoms to form stable PtCe alloys."
[3] "On the other hand, the high dispersion of Al sites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and support."
[4] "The metal-supported high-silica zeolite catalysts are beneficial to achieving high propylene selectivity and longer catalytic longevity."

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple levels of pore size for better reactant diffusion and product separation. The main types of these materials include Beta zeolites, Beta-557, Beta-39, Beta-145, and Beta-200, which differ in their SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. These materials are synthesized through a process involving calcination to remove organic templates, followed by impregnation with metal salts to load the desired metal species. The high-silica Beta zeolites, like Beta-557, offer a unique pore structure that benefits the dispersion of active sites and tuning of metal-support interactions, leading to improved PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites. The incorporation of Al sites in these hierarchical zeolites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and the support, contributing to the stability and longevity of the catalysts.

层次型沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，为PDH反应提供了增强的可接近性，因为它们提供了不同级别的孔径大小，有利于反应物扩散和产物分离。这些材料的主要类型包括Beta沸石、Beta-557、Beta-39、Beta-145和Beta-200，它们在SiO2/Al2O3比率方面有所不同。这些材料的合成过程涉及去除有机模板的煅烧，随后是金属盐的浸渍，以装载所需的金属物种。像Beta-557这样的高硅氧比Beta沸石提供了独特的孔结构，有利于活性位点的分散和金属-支持相互作用的调整，从而导致与传统沸石相比的改进PDH反应性能。在这些层次型沸石中引入Al位点增强了PtCe簇与支撑之间的相互作用，有助于催化剂的稳定性和寿命。
