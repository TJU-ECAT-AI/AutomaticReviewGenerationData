1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the active sites. The main types include high-silica Beta zeolites like Beta-557, which have a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, and dealuminated Beta zeolites. These materials are synthesized through dealumination processes, where the aluminum content is reduced by treating the zeolites with strong acids like hydrofluoric acid or sulfuric acid, or by using specific dealumination agents. The improved pore structure allows for better dispersion of metal species and reduces the risk of carbon deposition.

2. The high-silica Beta-557 zeolite is characterized by its actual SiO2/Al2O3 ratio being 557, determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

3. The actual metal loading of the catalysts before and after the PDH reaction was measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICAP 7000) instrument from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

4. In the H2-TPR experiments, the flowing He gas was initially introduced into the fresh samples at 400°C for 0.5 hours before reduction.

5. Compared to the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst, the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibited higher propylene yield and better stability, with an end yield of propylene being 35.7% for the former and 33.0% for the latter.

6. The XRD patterns of the fresh samples revealed the crystalline structure of the zeolites, including the well-crystalline BEA topology of the Beta-39, Beta-557, and Beta- samples.

7. The initial propane conversion of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta- catalyst was 40.7%, which was nearly equivalent to that of the optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst.

8. An appropriate increase in the amount of Ce species led to improvements in the dispersion of Pt sites, enhancing the catalytic performance.

9. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance with a 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity, along with a low deactivation constant of 0.013 h−1.

10. The amount of surface acid sites on PtCe-based catalysts increased with the number of added Ce species, potentially influencing the selectivity and stability of the catalysts.

11. Pure siliceous S-1 zeolite, lacking the proper number of surface Al sites, was unable to anchor PtCe particles effectively, as shown by the significantly aggregating Pt/Ce species on the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/S-1 catalyst.

12. The metal-supported high-silica zeolite catalysts provided enhanced propylene selectivity and longer catalytic longevity due to their optimized pore structure and metal-support interaction.

13. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst maintained excellent catalytic activity even after six regenerations, lasting up to 140 hours of reaction time, thanks to the synergy between the PtCe alloy and the high-silica zeolite support.
