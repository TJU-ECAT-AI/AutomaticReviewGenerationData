1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of these materials include high-silica Beta zeolites like Beta-557. They are synthesized through dealing alumina from the zeolite framework to create a high-silica content. This allows for more surface area and a better arrangement of active sites, thus improving the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

2. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites involves creating a structure that includes both micropores and mesopores/macropores. This is achieved by using zeolite materials with a high silica-to-alumina ratio, such as Beta-557 zeolite. The hierarchical structure enhances the accessibility of the active sites, which is crucial for the PDH reactions.

3. The use of pre-transition metal elements like cerium (Ce) as co-catalysts in PDH catalysts is investigated due to their specific catalytic properties and the simplicity of the regeneration process. These elements help in improving the dispersion of active sites and reducing the reduction temperature.

4. Strategies to improve the dispersion of rare-earth species are limited, but the use of silanol nests and aluminum sites in the zeolite framework can help in achieving this. This synergistic modulation of metal-support interaction leads to the construction of stable PtCe bimetallic clusters, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the PDH reaction.

5. The defect sites derived from silanol nests play a crucial role in dispersing PtCe clusters inside the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite, which improves the catalytic performance of the PDH reaction.

6. Metal-supported high-silica zeolite catalysts, like the PtCe cluster catalysts developed in this study, offer benefits such as high propylene selectivity and longer catalytic longevity, making them suitable for industrial applications in PDH reactions.

1. 多级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可访问性。主要类型包括高硅含量的Beta沸石，如Beta-557。通过去除框架中的铝来合成高硅含量的材料。这种结构提供了更多的表面积和更好的活性位点排列，从而改善了与传统沸石相比的PDH反应性能。

2. 多级沸石的合成涉及创建包含微孔和介孔/大孔的结构。这通过使用高硅比的沸石材料（如Beta-557沸石）来实现。这种层级结构增强了活性位点的可访问性，这对于PDH反应至关重要。

3. 研究使用预过渡金属元素，如铈（Ce），作为PDH催化剂的辅助剂，因为它们具有特定的催化特性且再生过程简单。这些元素有助于提高活性位点的分散性和降低还原温度。

4. 提高稀土物种分散性的策略有限，但通过在沸石骨架中利用硅醇基团和铝基团可以实现这一目标。这种协同调节金属-支撑相互作用的方法导致稳定PtCe双金属簇的构建，提高了PDH反应的催化活性和稳定性。

5. 来自硅醇基团的缺陷位点在高硅Beta-557沸石中对PtCe簇的分散起着关键作用，从而改善了PDH反应的催化性能。

6. 如本研究开发的金属支持高硅沸石催化剂（如PtCe簇催化剂）提供优势，如高丙烯选择性和更长的催化寿命，使其适合工业应用中的PDH反应。
