1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of these materials include MFI, MEL, and BEA structures. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal treatment or template-assisted techniques. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by providing better heat and mass transfer properties, thus offering enhanced stability and selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.
