The literature does not provide detailed information on how hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, or how they improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. Therefore, I am unable to answer the specific questions related to these aspects based on the provided document.
