Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions through their larger surface area. The synthesis methods used include template-directed processes such as hydrothermal treatment and sol-gel processes. These materials improve PDH reaction performance over traditional zeolites because of their enhanced catalytic sites and increased reactivity.
