1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. Main types include MCM-41, SBA-15, and SBA-16. These materials are synthesized through template-directed self-assembly processes. They improve the performance of PDH reactions by offering increased surface areas and better pore connectivity. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate superior stability and activity due to their distinctive pore structure.
