Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials were prepared by adding 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to gallosilicate MFI catalysts. The MPS addition leads to a significant increase in the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which control the selectivity of PDH reactions. This enhancement results in higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products. When compared to a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, the gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS show a lower rate of deactivation but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (75% vs 85%).

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料通过向GA-MFI沸石催化剂中添加3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）来制备。MPS的添加导致强Lewis酸位点浓度显著增加，这些位点控制着PDH反应的选择性。这提高了丙烷转化率并改善了丙烯选择性，同时限制了裂解和芳构化产物。与基准氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂相比，使用MPS制备的GA-MFI材料降解速率较低（低50%以上），但丙烯选择性稍差（GA-MFI：75%；氧化铬-氧化铝：85%）。
