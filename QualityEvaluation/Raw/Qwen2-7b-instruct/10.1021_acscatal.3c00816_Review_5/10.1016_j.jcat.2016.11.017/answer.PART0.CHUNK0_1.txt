[1] "Previously, MPS has been used to incorporate metal and metal sulfide clusters such as Pt, Rh, Ag, and CdS in MFI, SOD, GIS and LTA zeolite channels."
[2] "It was proposed that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage."
[3] "At the same time, the thiol group on the 3-mercaptopropyl moiety interacts with metallic ions (such as Pt2+ or Cd2+) in the zeolite synthesis solution (or gel), thereby facilitating their occlusion in the zeolite pores during crystallization."
[4] "The new gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared by MPS addition are shown (via FTIR characterization of pyridine adsorption as well as temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and isopropylamine) to possess lower Brnsted acid site concentrations and enhanced Lewis acid site concentrations compared to the catalyst prepared in the conventional way, without MPS addition."
[5] "These catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS give higher propylene selectivities and enhanced propane conversion rates at a fixed propylene conversion level."

Hierarchical zeolites, such as gallosilicate MFI, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant molecules to interact with the catalyst surface. The synthesis methods involve adding functional silanes like 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to the zeolite synthesis gel. This results in the incorporation of sulfur into the zeolite structure, leading to the formation of stronger Lewis acid sites compared to conventional zeolites. The presence of these enhanced Lewis acid sites facilitates the PDH reaction more efficiently, leading to higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity. The improved performance over traditional zeolites is attributed to the optimized distribution and concentration of acid sites, which control the selectivity of the PDH process.

层状沸石，如含镓硅沸石MFI，通过提供更大的表面积来增强PDH反应的可访问性，该表面积使反应物分子能够与催化剂表面相互作用。合成方法包括向沸石合成胶体中添加功能硅烷，如3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）。这导致硫在沸石结构中的掺入，从而形成比传统沸石更强的路易斯酸中心。这些增强的路易斯酸中心更有效地促进PDH反应，导致更高的丙烷转化率和更好的丙烯选择性。与传统沸石相比，性能的改进归因于酸位点优化分布和浓度，这些酸位点控制PDH过程的选择性。
