[1] "The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) behavior of gallosilicate MFI catalysts synthesized in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) is investigated."
[2] "MPS addition to the zeolite synthesis gel results in gallosilicate molecular sieves with reduced Brnsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity, as shown by combined NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), isopropylamine (IPA) TPD and IR analysis of pyridine-loaded catalysts."
[3] "In particular, the gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared using MPS provide a significant concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which are important in controlling the selectivity of PDH."
[4] "Enhanced PDH performance with higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products are obtained from the catalysts synthesized with MPS."
[5] "The gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS are compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, and the gallosilicate materials have a lower rate of deactivation (>50% lower) but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (Ga-MFI: 75%; Chromia-Alumina: 85%)."

1. Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant adsorption and product diffusion. The main types include MFI, MCM-41, and SBA-15. These materials are synthesized through hydrothermal methods, sol-gel processes, or template-directed synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer superior performance due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and improved mass transfer properties, leading to higher conversion rates and selectivities in PDH reactions.

1. 多级孔结构的沸石，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的吸附反应物和产物扩散表面来增强PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括MFI、MCM-41和SBA-15。这些材料通过水热方法、溶胶-凝胶过程或模板导向合成进行制备。与传统沸石相比，多级孔沸石由于其增强的表面积、孔径大小分布控制和改进的质量传输特性，在PDH反应中提供了更高的转化率和选择性。
