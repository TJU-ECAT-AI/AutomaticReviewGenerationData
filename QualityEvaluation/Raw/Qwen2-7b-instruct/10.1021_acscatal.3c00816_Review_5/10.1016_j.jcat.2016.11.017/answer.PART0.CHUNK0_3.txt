<p>The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) behavior of gallosilicate MFI catalysts synthesized in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) is investigated.</p>
<p>In particular, the gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared using MPS provide a significant concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which are important in controlling the selectivity of PDH.</p>
<p>Enhanced PDH performance with higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products are obtained from the catalysts synthesized with MPS.</p>
<p>The gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS are compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, and the gallosilicate materials have a lower rate of deactivation (>50% lower) but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (Ga-MFI: 75%; Chromia-Alumina: 85%).</p>

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants. The main types of these materials are gallosilicate MFI zeolites prepared through a typical hydrothermal zeolite MFI synthesis with the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane precursor (MPS) and Ga nitrate as a metal source. This method leads to a different acid site profile, with lower Brnsted acid site concentrations and enhanced Lewis acid site concentrations compared to the conventional preparation method without MPS addition. The improved Lewis acid sites contribute to higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity at a fixed propylene conversion level. Compared to a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, the gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS show a lower rate of deactivation and slightly inferior propylene selectivity.

这些分层沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的表面积和更易于接近的反应物位点，来增强PDH反应的可访问性。这些材料的主要类型是通过典型的水热沸石MFI合成方法制备的含镓硅酸盐MFI沸石，该方法中添加了3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷前体（MPS）和镓硝酸盐作为金属源。这种方法导致了不同的酸位谱，具有较低的布郎斯特酸位浓度和增强的伦斯酸位浓度与常规无MPS添加的准备方法相比。改进的伦斯酸位有助于更高的丙烷转化率和在固定丙烯转化率水平下改善丙烯选择性。与基准氧化铝铬催化剂相比，使用MPS制备的含镓硅酸盐MFI材料显示出较低的活性损失速率和略低的丙烯选择性。
