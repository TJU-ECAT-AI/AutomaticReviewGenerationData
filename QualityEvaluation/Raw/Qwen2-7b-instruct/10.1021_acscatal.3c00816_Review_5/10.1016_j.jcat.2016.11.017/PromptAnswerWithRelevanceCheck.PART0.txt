[1] "The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) behavior of gallosilicate MFI catalysts synthesized in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) is investigated."
[2] "MPS addition to the zeolite synthesis gel results in gallosilicate molecular sieves with reduced Brnsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity, as shown by combined NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), isopropylamine (IPA) TPD and IR analysis of pyridine-loaded catalysts."
[3] "In particular, the gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared using MPS provide a significant concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which are important in controlling the selectivity of PDH."
[4] "Enhanced PDH performance with higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products are obtained from the catalysts synthesized with MPS."
[5] "The gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS are compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, and the gallosilicate materials have a lower rate of deactivation (>50% lower) but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (Ga-MFI: 75%; Chromia-Alumina: 85%)."

1. Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant adsorption and product diffusion. The main types include MFI, MCM-41, and SBA-15. These materials are synthesized through hydrothermal methods, sol-gel processes, or template-directed synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer superior performance due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and improved mass transfer properties, leading to higher conversion rates and selectivities in PDH reactions.

[1] "Previously, MPS has been used to incorporate metal and metal sulfide clusters such as Pt, Rh, Ag, and CdS in MFI, SOD, GIS and LTA zeolite channels."
[2] "It was proposed that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage."
[3] "At the same time, the thiol group on the 3-mercaptopropyl moiety interacts with metallic ions (such as Pt2+ or Cd2+) in the zeolite synthesis solution (or gel), thereby facilitating their occlusion in the zeolite pores during crystallization."
[4] "The new gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared by MPS addition are shown (via FTIR characterization of pyridine adsorption as well as temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and isopropylamine) to possess lower Brnsted acid site concentrations and enhanced Lewis acid site concentrations compared to the catalyst prepared in the conventional way, without MPS addition."
[5] "These catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS give higher propylene selectivities and enhanced propane conversion rates at a fixed propylene conversion level."

Hierarchical zeolites, such as gallosilicate MFI, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant molecules to interact with the catalyst surface. The synthesis methods involve adding functional silanes like 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to the zeolite synthesis gel. This results in the incorporation of sulfur into the zeolite structure, leading to the formation of stronger Lewis acid sites compared to conventional zeolites. The presence of these enhanced Lewis acid sites facilitates the PDH reaction more efficiently, leading to higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity. The improved performance over traditional zeolites is attributed to the optimized distribution and concentration of acid sites, which control the selectivity of the PDH process.

层状沸石，如含镓硅沸石MFI，通过提供更大的表面积来增强PDH反应的可访问性，该表面积使反应物分子能够与催化剂表面相互作用。合成方法包括向沸石合成胶体中添加功能硅烷，如3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）。这导致硫在沸石结构中的掺入，从而形成比传统沸石更强的路易斯酸中心。这些增强的路易斯酸中心更有效地促进PDH反应，导致更高的丙烷转化率和更好的丙烯选择性。与传统沸石相比，性能的改进归因于酸位点优化分布和浓度，这些酸位点控制PDH过程的选择性。

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials were prepared by adding 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to gallosilicate MFI catalysts. The MPS addition leads to a significant increase in the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which control the selectivity of PDH reactions. This enhancement results in higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products. When compared to a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, the gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS show a lower rate of deactivation but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (75% vs 85%).

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料通过向GA-MFI沸石催化剂中添加3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）来制备。MPS的添加导致强Lewis酸位点浓度显著增加，这些位点控制着PDH反应的选择性。这提高了丙烷转化率并改善了丙烯选择性，同时限制了裂解和芳构化产物。与基准氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂相比，使用MPS制备的GA-MFI材料降解速率较低（低50%以上），但丙烯选择性稍差（GA-MFI：75%；氧化铬-氧化铝：85%）。

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants. The main types of these materials are gallosilicate MFI zeolites prepared through a typical hydrothermal zeolite MFI synthesis with the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane precursor (MPS) and Ga nitrate as a metal source. This method leads to a different acid site profile, with lower Brnsted acid site concentrations and enhanced Lewis acid site concentrations compared to the conventional preparation method without MPS addition. The improved Lewis acid sites contribute to higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity at a fixed propylene conversion level. Compared to a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, the gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS show a lower rate of deactivation and slightly inferior propylene selectivity.

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve the accessibility for PDH reactions. The synthesis of gallosilicate MFI catalysts involves the use of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to create materials with reduced Brnsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity. The introduction of MPS leads to the creation of strong Lewis acid sites within the gallosilicate MFI catalysts. These catalysts demonstrate improved performance in PDH reactions, featuring higher propane conversion rates and enhanced propylene selectivity, with minimal cracking and aromatization products. Compared to benchmark chromia-alumina catalysts, gallosilicate MFI materials prepared with MPS exhibit a lower rate of deactivation, albeit with slightly inferior propylene selectivity (75% vs 85%).
