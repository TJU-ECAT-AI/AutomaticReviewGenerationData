Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve the accessibility for PDH reactions. The synthesis of gallosilicate MFI catalysts involves the use of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to create materials with reduced Brnsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity. The introduction of MPS leads to the creation of strong Lewis acid sites within the gallosilicate MFI catalysts. These catalysts demonstrate improved performance in PDH reactions, featuring higher propane conversion rates and enhanced propylene selectivity, with minimal cracking and aromatization products. Compared to benchmark chromia-alumina catalysts, gallosilicate MFI materials prepared with MPS exhibit a lower rate of deactivation, albeit with slightly inferior propylene selectivity (75% vs 85%).

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。通过使用3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）合成沸石MFI催化剂，可以实现Brnsted酸度的降低和Lewis酸性的增强。引入MPS能够产生强Lewis酸位点在沸石MFI催化剂中。这些催化剂在PDH反应中表现出更高的丙烷转化率和改进的丙烯选择性，并且具有最小的裂解和芳构化产物。与标准的氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂相比，使用MPS制备的沸石MFI材料表现出较低的失活速率（低50%），但丙烯选择性略差（沸石MFI：75%；氧化铬-氧化铝：85%）。
