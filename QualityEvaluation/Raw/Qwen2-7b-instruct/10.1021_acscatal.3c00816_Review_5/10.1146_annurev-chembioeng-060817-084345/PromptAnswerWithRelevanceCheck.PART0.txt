Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to optimize accessibility for partial olefin hydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key types encompass mesoporous-zeolite composites and templated macroporous zeolites. Synthesis techniques typically involve the utilization of organic templates or sacrificial materials to introduce mesopores and macropores. These materials exhibit superior performance in PDH reactions due to increased accessible surface areas and improved diffusion channels. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate enhanced activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.
