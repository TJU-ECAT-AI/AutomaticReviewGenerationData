[1] "Hierarchical zeolites are a type of porous material that combines micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include MFI, MCM-41, and SBA-15, among others."
[3] "These materials can be synthesized through methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and hydrothermal treatments."
[4] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit higher surface area, improved stability, and better selectivity in PDH reactions due to their unique pore structures."
