Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to optimize accessibility for PDH reactions. The key types are MFI, MCM-41, and ZSM-5. Synthesis is achieved through sol-gel, hydrothermal, and template-based methods. These zeolites outperform traditional ones in PDH reaction efficiency due to superior surface area, pore size distribution, and catalyst loading.
