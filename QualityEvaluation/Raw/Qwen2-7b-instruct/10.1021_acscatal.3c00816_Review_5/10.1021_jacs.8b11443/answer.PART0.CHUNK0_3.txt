Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary categories of these materials are distinguished by their pore size distribution and synthesis methodologies, which include vapor-phase exchange, ion-exchange, and sol-gel processes. Compared to conventional zeolites, these materials exhibit superior performance in PDH reactions due to improved diffusion channels and increased thermal stability.
