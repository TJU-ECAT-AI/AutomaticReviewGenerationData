<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of hierarchical zeolites are MFI, MEL, and ZSM-5. These materials are synthesized through sol-gel, hydrothermal treatment, and ion-exchange processes. Hierarchical zeolites outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reactions, thanks to their superior thermal stability, selectivity, and activity, primarily due to their distinctive pore structure.
