Answer: Hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, which allows for better control over reactant diffusion and product removal. The main types of these materials typically involve MFI zeolite nanosheets with subnanometric CoO clusters distributed regioselectively. The synthesis methods usually involve chemical precipitation, sol-gel, and template-based techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show improved performance due to enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity, as well as better thermal resistance and recyclability.
