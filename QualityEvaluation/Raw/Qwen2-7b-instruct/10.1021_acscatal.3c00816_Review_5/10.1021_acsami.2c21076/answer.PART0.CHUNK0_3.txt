Answer: Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products. This design allows for improved mass transfer, which is crucial for efficient propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The main types of these materials include zeolites with different pore sizes tailored for specific reaction conditions. Synthesis methods typically involve techniques such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and hydrothermal treatments. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by offering better selectivity, stability, and activity due to their optimized pore structures and enhanced surface areas.
