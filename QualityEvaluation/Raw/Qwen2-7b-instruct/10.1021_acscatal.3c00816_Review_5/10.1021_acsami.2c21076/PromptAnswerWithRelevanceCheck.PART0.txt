Answer: Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction, thus increasing the contact between propane molecules and active sites. The main types of these materials include MFI, MOR, and ZSM-5 zeolites. They can be synthesized through hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel method, or template-directed synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore structure, which facilitates better diffusion of reactants and products.

Answer: Hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, which allows for better control over reactant diffusion and product removal. The main types of these materials typically involve MFI zeolite nanosheets with subnanometric CoO clusters distributed regioselectively. The synthesis methods usually involve chemical precipitation, sol-gel, and template-based techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show improved performance due to enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity, as well as better thermal resistance and recyclability.

Answer: Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products. This design allows for improved mass transfer, which is crucial for efficient propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The main types of these materials include zeolites with different pore sizes tailored for specific reaction conditions. Synthesis methods typically involve techniques such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and hydrothermal treatments. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by offering better selectivity, stability, and activity due to their optimized pore structures and enhanced surface areas.
