The investigation into the different Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere for propane dehydrogenation Highlights • The anti-reduction Co species is synthesized via oxygen-free heat-treatment. • The TOFCo of Co-S-1-Ar for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air. • The highly dispersed Co2+ species are responsible for superior PDH performance. • The Co2+ species is generated via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1.

This study highlights that anti-reduction Co species are synthesized through oxygen-free heat-treatment. The turnover frequency of cobalt (TOFCo) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on Co-S-1-Ar is nearly nine times higher than on Co/S-1-Air. The superior PDH performance is attributed to the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework, which is formed by replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1.

这项研究强调，通过无氧热处理合成抗还原性钴物种。在Co-S-1-Ar上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的转速频率（TOFCo）几乎是Co/S-1-Air的九倍。这种优异的PDH性能归因于融入Silicalite-1框架中的高度分散的四面体配合态Co2+物种，该物种是通过替换Silicalite-1中的硅醇巢形成的。

The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species.

Further in-situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis elucidates the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar. Cobalt precursors are propelled by Ar to achieve highly dispersed silanol nests at high temperature. The Co species are then anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species.
