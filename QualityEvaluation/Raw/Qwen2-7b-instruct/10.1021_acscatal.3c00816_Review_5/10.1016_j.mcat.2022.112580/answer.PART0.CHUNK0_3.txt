<p>Both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples exhibit the characteristic peaks of MFI structure at 8.0o, 8.9o, 23.2o, 23.9o and 24.3o.</p>
<p>It could be found that both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples exhibit the typical adsorption behavior of microporous material with a type of I isotherm.</p>
<p>It is noted that two absorption peaks located at around 470 and 741 nm attributed to Co3O4 species are observed in Co/S-1-Air catalyst.</p>
<p>While Co-S-1-Ar exhibits three absorption peaks at approximately 520, 592 and 649 nm, which are associated with the Co2+ ions in a tetrahedral geometry.</p>
<p>It is noted that two obvious peaks at 354 and 414 C appear over Co3O4 samples.</p>
<p>For the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, a salient peak is observed at 337 C, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species.</p>
<p>However, a different reduction curve is obtained on the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst where a barely visible peak exists at 417 C, demonstrating that almost all Co species are difficult to be reduced.</p>
<p>From the characterization result of H2-TPR in Fig. 11 A, no obvious H2 reduction peak is observed over 0.6Co-S-1-Ar and 1.6Co-S-1-Ar catalysts.</p>
<p>As for the 2.4Co-S-1-Ar catalyst, a reduction peak appears at 315 C, which could be ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 species.</p>
<p>With the extension of IR spectra collected time, a broad peak at about 3500 cm1 assigned to the silanol nests decreases gradually, and it becomes stable after 180 min.</p>
<p>In addition, the further IR spectra in the hydroxyl stretching in Fig. 12 B shows that the intensity of absorption band at 3500 cm1 corresponding to silanol nests decreases with Co-S-1-Ar << Co/S-1-Air < Silicalite-1, which could be inferred that the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 is condensed more during Ar calcination.</p>

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant adsorption and facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include modified silicalite-1, which is synthesized via solid-phase grinding of Co precursor and silicalite-1, followed by heat treatment under different atmospheres. The synthesis methods involve changing the calcination atmosphere to isolate and stabilize Co species effectively from aggregation. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by incorporating highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species into the zeolite framework, which leads to high Lewis acid sites and better propane adsorption properties, resulting in superior catalytic activity for PDH. The use of oxygen-free atmospheres in calcination facilitates the transformation of Co species into Co2+, enhancing the stability and catalytic performance of the catalysts.

这些分级沸石通过提供更大的表面面积来增强PDH反应的可访问性，从而为反应物吸附和促进反应物和产物的扩散。这些材料的主要类型包括修改后的硅铝沸石-1，通过固体相研磨Co前体和硅铝沸石-1制备，然后在不同的气氛下进行热处理。合成方法涉及改变煅烧气氛以有效地隔离和稳定Co物种，避免聚集。与传统沸石相比，这些分级沸石通过将Co物种主要分散到沸石框架中，形成四面体配合的Co2+物种，改善了PDH反应性能。这导致高Lewis酸位点和更好的丙烷吸附性能，从而获得PDH的优越催化活性。使用无氧气氛在煅烧过程中促进了Co物种向Co2+的转变，增强了催化剂的稳定性并提高了催化性能。
