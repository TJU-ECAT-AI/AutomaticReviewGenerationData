1. The anti-reduction Co species synthesized via oxygen-free heat-treatment shows a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 41.9 h1 for PDH, which is nine times higher than the TOF of 4.6 h1 for the Co species synthesized via air heat-treatment.

2. The superior PDH performance of the Co species over Silicalite-1 is attributed to the presence of highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species within the framework of the zeolite, which also possess Lewis acid sites.

3. The Co2+ species in the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst is incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework through the replacement of silanol nests, which enables its high dispersion and stability during PDH reactions.

1. 通过无氧热处理合成的抗还原性Co物种，其PDH的周转频率（TOF）为41.9 h1，是通过空气热处理合成的Co物种的TOF（4.6 h1）的九倍。

2. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂中表现出优越PDH性能的原因在于其框架内分散度高、四面体配合的Co2+物种的存在，这些物种还具有Lewis酸位点。

3. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂中的Co2+物种通过替换硅醇巢被整合到Silicalite-1框架中，这使得它在PDH反应期间保持高度分散和稳定性。
