1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The synthesis methods involve modulating heat-treatment atmosphere to create different Co species over Silicalite-1 for systematic investigation in PDH reactions.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are those that combine micropores and mesopores/macropores. They are synthesized by controlling the heat-treatment atmosphere, leading to the creation of various Co species over Silicalite-1 for PDH reactions. This approach improves performance compared to traditional zeolites.

3. Oxygen-free calcined catalysts, such as Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum, demonstrate outstanding catalytic performance for PDH reactions.

4. These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites due to their unique pore structures and controlled synthesis methods that lead to optimized Co species for catalytic activity.
