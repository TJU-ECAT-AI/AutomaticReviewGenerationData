<p>The tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species anchored by the silanol nests of zeolite framework are obtained by oxygen-free heat-treatment and show superior performance for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>In comparison with O2-included calcination catalyst, the TOF of Co-S-1-Ar (41.9 h1) for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1).</p>
<p>According to the combined characterizations, it is confirmed that the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance, while bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air has much lower catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Through in-situ FT-IR characterization, it is revealed that Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar is incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed and then further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species under high temperature calcination.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to enter and exit the catalyst, thus improving the efficiency of the reaction. The main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. These materials are synthesized through methods such as hydrothermal synthesis and solid-phase grinding. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating better control over the dispersion of active sites, reducing the likelihood of unwanted side reactions, and enhancing the overall catalytic activity.

2. The synthesis of Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere leads to different performance in propane dehydrogenation. Oxygen-free heat-treatment produces Co2+ species that are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework, showing superior performance due to their high Lewis acidity and effective propane adsorption properties. In contrast, Co/S-1-Air, treated with air, forms Co3O4 species, which are unstable and prone to reduction, leading to low propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. The formation of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar occurs through a process where Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 highly dispersed. These Co species are then anchored by the silanol nests and incorporated into the framework with Co2+ species under high temperature calcination. This method enhances the stability and dispersion of the Co2+ species, contributing to the improved PDH performance.

1. 多级孔结构的沸石通过提供多种通道来增强丙烷脱氢反应中的可访问性，从而提高反应效率。主要类型包括介孔和大孔沸石。这些材料通过水热合成和固相研磨等方法制备。与传统沸石相比，多级孔沸石通过更好地控制活性位点的分散、减少不希望的副反应的可能性以及增强整体催化活性，提高了丙烷脱氢反应的性能。

2. 通过调节热处理气氛合成Co物种在Silicalite-1上的方法导致不同的丙烷脱氢性能。无氧热处理产生嵌入到Silicalite-1框架中的Co2+物种，显示出优越的性能，这是由于其高Lewis酸性和有效的丙烷吸附性质。相比之下，Co/S-1-Air通过空气热处理形成的Co3O4物种不稳定且易还原，导致低丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. Co2+物种在Co-S-1-Ar上形成的过程是：Co前体被Ar驱动以高度分散的方式到达Silicalite-1的硅醇巢。这些Co物种随后由硅醇巢锚定并与Co2+物种一起融入框架中，在高温煅烧过程中。这种方法增强了Co2+物种的稳定性和分散性，有助于提高丙烷脱氢性能。
