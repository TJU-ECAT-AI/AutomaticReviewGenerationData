1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to enter and exit the catalyst, thus improving the efficiency of the reaction. The main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. These materials are synthesized through methods such as hydrothermal synthesis and solid-phase grinding. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating better control over the dispersion of active sites, reducing the likelihood of unwanted side reactions, and enhancing the overall catalytic activity.

2. The synthesis of Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere leads to different performance in propane dehydrogenation. Oxygen-free heat-treatment produces Co2+ species that are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework, showing superior performance due to their high Lewis acidity and effective propane adsorption properties. In contrast, Co/S-1-Air, treated with air, forms Co3O4 species, which are unstable and prone to reduction, leading to low propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. The formation of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar occurs through a process where Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 highly dispersed. These Co species are then anchored by the silanol nests and incorporated into the framework with Co2+ species under high temperature calcination. This method enhances the stability and dispersion of the Co2+ species, contributing to the improved PDH performance.

1. 多级孔结构的沸石通过提供多种通道来增强丙烷脱氢反应中的可访问性，从而提高反应效率。主要类型包括介孔和大孔沸石。这些材料通过水热合成和固相研磨等方法制备。与传统沸石相比，多级孔沸石通过更好地控制活性位点的分散、减少不希望的副反应的可能性以及增强整体催化活性，提高了丙烷脱氢反应的性能。

2. 通过调节热处理气氛合成Co物种在Silicalite-1上的方法导致不同的丙烷脱氢性能。无氧热处理产生嵌入到Silicalite-1框架中的Co2+物种，显示出优越的性能，这是由于其高Lewis酸性和有效的丙烷吸附性质。相比之下，Co/S-1-Air通过空气热处理形成的Co3O4物种不稳定且易还原，导致低丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. Co2+物种在Co-S-1-Ar上形成的过程是：Co前体被Ar驱动以高度分散的方式到达Silicalite-1的硅醇巢。这些Co物种随后由硅醇巢锚定并与Co2+物种一起融入框架中，在高温煅烧过程中。这种方法增强了Co2+物种的稳定性和分散性，有助于提高丙烷脱氢性能。

<p>Both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples exhibit the characteristic peaks of MFI structure at 8.0o, 8.9o, 23.2o, 23.9o and 24.3o.</p>
<p>It could be found that both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples exhibit the typical adsorption behavior of microporous material with a type of I isotherm.</p>
<p>It is noted that two absorption peaks located at around 470 and 741 nm attributed to Co3O4 species are observed in Co/S-1-Air catalyst.</p>
<p>While Co-S-1-Ar exhibits three absorption peaks at approximately 520, 592 and 649 nm, which are associated with the Co2+ ions in a tetrahedral geometry.</p>
<p>It is noted that two obvious peaks at 354 and 414 C appear over Co3O4 samples.</p>
<p>For the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, a salient peak is observed at 337 C, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species.</p>
<p>However, a different reduction curve is obtained on the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst where a barely visible peak exists at 417 C, demonstrating that almost all Co species are difficult to be reduced.</p>
<p>From the characterization result of H2-TPR in Fig. 11 A, no obvious H2 reduction peak is observed over 0.6Co-S-1-Ar and 1.6Co-S-1-Ar catalysts.</p>
<p>As for the 2.4Co-S-1-Ar catalyst, a reduction peak appears at 315 C, which could be ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 species.</p>
<p>With the extension of IR spectra collected time, a broad peak at about 3500 cm1 assigned to the silanol nests decreases gradually, and it becomes stable after 180 min.</p>
<p>In addition, the further IR spectra in the hydroxyl stretching in Fig. 12 B shows that the intensity of absorption band at 3500 cm1 corresponding to silanol nests decreases with Co-S-1-Ar << Co/S-1-Air < Silicalite-1, which could be inferred that the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 is condensed more during Ar calcination.</p>

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant adsorption and facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include modified silicalite-1, which is synthesized via solid-phase grinding of Co precursor and silicalite-1, followed by heat treatment under different atmospheres. The synthesis methods involve changing the calcination atmosphere to isolate and stabilize Co species effectively from aggregation. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by incorporating highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species into the zeolite framework, which leads to high Lewis acid sites and better propane adsorption properties, resulting in superior catalytic activity for PDH. The use of oxygen-free atmospheres in calcination facilitates the transformation of Co species into Co2+, enhancing the stability and catalytic performance of the catalysts.
