Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. Materials like ZIFs, a type of MOF, serve as suitable precursors for synthesizing isolated metal sites within N-doped carbon materials. By adjusting the spatial distance between metal sites through the organic linker, the catalyst CoOx@NC/S-1 exhibits excellent PDH performance with a 40% propane conversion and 97% propene selectivity, maintaining stability over a 10-hour reaction at 600°C.
