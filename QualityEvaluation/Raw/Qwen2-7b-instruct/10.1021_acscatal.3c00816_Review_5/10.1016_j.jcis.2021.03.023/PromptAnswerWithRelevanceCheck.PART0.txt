<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores or macropores to augment accessibility for PDH reactions. They are synthesized through a multistep process that starts with the formation of a template, followed by the introduction of metal ions and organic linkers to create the zeolite framework. These materials surpass traditional zeolites in PDH reaction performance due to their increased surface area and more accessible pore structures.

[1] "Hierarchical zeolites, which combine micropores and mesopores/macropores, can enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "Materials such as ZIFs, a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), are composed of metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which make them suitable precursors for the synthesis of metal sites confined in N-doped carbon."
[3] "The spatial distance between metal sites can be adjusted due to the coordination environment provided by the organic linker."
[4] "Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process."
[5] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. Materials like ZIFs, a type of MOF, serve as suitable precursors for synthesizing isolated metal sites within N-doped carbon materials. By adjusting the spatial distance between metal sites through the organic linker, the catalyst CoOx@NC/S-1 exhibits excellent PDH performance with a 40% propane conversion and 97% propene selectivity, maintaining stability over a 10-hour reaction at 600°C.
