[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "Hierarchical zeolites are synthesized through a multi-step process that includes the creation of a template, followed by the incorporation of metal ions and organic linkers to form the zeolite framework."
[3] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pore structures."

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores or macropores to augment accessibility for PDH reactions. They are synthesized through a multistep process that starts with the formation of a template, followed by the introduction of metal ions and organic linkers to create the zeolite framework. These materials surpass traditional zeolites in PDH reaction performance due to their increased surface area and more accessible pore structures.

层次型沸石通过整合微孔、介孔或大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们是通过多步过程合成的，首先形成模板，然后引入金属离子和有机链接器以形成沸石骨架。这些材料在PDH反应性能上超越传统沸石，因为它们具有更大的表面积和更易接近的孔结构。
