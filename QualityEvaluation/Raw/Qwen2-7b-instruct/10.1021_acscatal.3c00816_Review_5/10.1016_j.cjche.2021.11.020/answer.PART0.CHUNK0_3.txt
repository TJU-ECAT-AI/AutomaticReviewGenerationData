1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products. This structure allows for easier diffusion of propane molecules to the active sites of PtSn particles and facilitates the rapid removal of propylene products, reducing the risk of cracking and coking.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those produced through a desilication process, typically involving treatments of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solutions under mild conditions. Synthesis methods involve creating mesopores within the zeolite structure and then loading Pt-Sn species into these mesopores. This process leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts that exhibit improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to the enhanced accessibility and stability of PtSn particles.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate higher efficiency in PDH reactions, delivering initial conversions and propylene selectivities that surpass those of conventional catalysts. This superior performance is attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles within the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, which stabilizes the particles and facilitates efficient propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures.

1. 层级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，增强PDH反应的可及性，提供了更大的表面积和更多的通道，使得反应物和产物能够更易于扩散到PtSn颗粒的活性位点，并促进丙烷产品的快速移除，从而降低裂解和结焦的风险。

2. 层级沸石的主要类型包括通过使用碱溶液在温和条件下对ZSM-5沸石进行脱硅处理所生产的类型。合成方法涉及在沸石结构中创建介孔，然后将Pt-Sn物种加载到这些介孔中，进而形成Pt-Sn/层级ZSM-5催化剂。这些催化剂在PDH反应中的性能优于传统沸石，因为它们提高了PtSn颗粒的可及性和稳定性。

3. 相比于传统沸石，PtSn/层级ZSM-5催化剂在PDH反应中表现出更高的效率，初始转化率和丙烯选择性超过了常规催化剂。这种优越的性能归因于PtSn颗粒被限制在层级ZSM-5沸石的介孔中，这稳定了颗粒并促进了高温下高效的丙烷脱氢。
