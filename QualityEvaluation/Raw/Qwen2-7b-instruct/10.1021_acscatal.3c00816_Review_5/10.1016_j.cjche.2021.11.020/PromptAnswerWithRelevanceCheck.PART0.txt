[1] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature. Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate."
[2] "Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition."
[3] "The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5."
[4] "The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by allowing smaller molecules to enter through micropores while larger molecules can diffuse through mesopores. This dual-pore system improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, which often lack sufficient mesopore structure. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites are synthesized by treating conventional ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solutions under mild conditions, which creates a hierarchical structure with both micropores and mesopores. The introduction of Sn and Pt species into this structure leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts. The high efficiency of these catalysts in PDH reactions is primarily due to the confinement of PtSn particles within the mesopores of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, which stabilizes the particles at high temperatures and accelerates diffusion rates.

层状沸石通过将微孔和介孔/大孔结合，提高了PDH反应的可接近性，允许较小的分子通过微孔进入，而较大的分子可以通过介孔扩散。这种双孔系统与传统沸石相比改进了PDH反应性能，后者往往缺乏足够的介孔结构。通过温和条件下的碱溶液处理常规沸石，可以合成具有微孔和介孔的层状沸石。向此结构中引入Sn和Pt物种导致形成Pt-Sn/层状沸石催化剂。这些催化剂在PDH反应中的高效率主要归因于PtSn颗粒被限制在层状沸石的介孔内，这在高温下稳定了颗粒，并加速了扩散速率。

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. The micropores ensure a high surface area for adsorption, while the mesopores and macropores facilitate easier diffusion of molecules, improving the efficiency of the PDH reactions.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites involve the creation of mesopores within the zeolite structure through treatments with alkali solutions under mild conditions. This process allows for the controlled synthesis of materials with tailored pore structures, enhancing their catalytic performance.

3. The synthesis methods of these materials typically involve treating traditional zeolites with alkali solutions, which selectively removes certain components (like silica) to create mesoporous structures. The introduction of metals like Sn and Pt into these materials leads to the formation of bimetallic catalysts that exhibit superior performance in PDH reactions due to the confinement of the metal particles in the mesopores, which stabilizes them at high temperatures and facilitates more efficient reactions.

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by confining PtSn particles within mesopores, stabilizing them at high temperatures, and accelerating diffusion rates. This allows for easier access of propane to PtSn particles for dehydrogenation and faster diffusion of propylene out, reducing cracking and coking. The hierarchical ZSM-5 is synthesized through a mild treatment of ZSM-5 with alkali solution, leading to the formation of hierarchical structures with improved catalytic performance. Among various PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst exhibits the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, achieving an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570°C.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products. This structure allows for easier diffusion of propane molecules to the active sites of PtSn particles and facilitates the rapid removal of propylene products, reducing the risk of cracking and coking.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those produced through a desilication process, typically involving treatments of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solutions under mild conditions. Synthesis methods involve creating mesopores within the zeolite structure and then loading Pt-Sn species into these mesopores. This process leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts that exhibit improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to the enhanced accessibility and stability of PtSn particles.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate higher efficiency in PDH reactions, delivering initial conversions and propylene selectivities that surpass those of conventional catalysts. This superior performance is attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles within the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, which stabilizes the particles and facilitates efficient propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. The presence of mesopores allows for better confinement and stabilization of active catalyst particles, reducing sintering and improving stability. Micropores ensure high surface area for effective adsorption of reactants, while mesopores facilitate easier access and diffusion, promoting efficient reactions. This combination improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by optimizing the distribution of active sites and enhancing mass transfer rates.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those synthesized through treatments of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solutions under mild conditions, leading to the formation of mesopores within the microporous structure. This method enables the creation of materials with both micropores and mesopores/macropores. The synthesis involves the creation of mesopores followed by the loading of metals like Sn and Pt into the hierarchical zeolite structure, resulting in Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts.

3. The performance enhancement of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. This confinement effect stabilizes the particles at high temperatures, preventing sintering, and allows for efficient dehydrogenation reactions without compromising selectivity. The presence of mesopores accelerates diffusion rates, enabling easier access of reactants to the active sites and facilitating faster product release, thus contributing to the high efficiency of these catalysts.
