[1] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition."
[2] "The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5."
[3] "The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. The micropores ensure a high surface area for adsorption, while the mesopores and macropores facilitate easier diffusion of molecules, improving the efficiency of the PDH reactions.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites involve the creation of mesopores within the zeolite structure through treatments with alkali solutions under mild conditions. This process allows for the controlled synthesis of materials with tailored pore structures, enhancing their catalytic performance.

3. The synthesis methods of these materials typically involve treating traditional zeolites with alkali solutions, which selectively removes certain components (like silica) to create mesoporous structures. The introduction of metals like Sn and Pt into these materials leads to the formation of bimetallic catalysts that exhibit superior performance in PDH reactions due to the confinement of the metal particles in the mesopores, which stabilizes them at high temperatures and facilitates more efficient reactions.

1. 层状沸石通过将微孔与介孔或大孔结合，增强了丙烷脱氢反应的可接近性。微孔提供了高表面积以吸附分子，而介孔和大孔则有利于分子的扩散，提高反应效率。

2. 层状沸石的主要类型包括在温和条件下通过碱溶液处理传统沸石来创建介孔结构。这一过程允许对材料进行精确合成，以获得具有定制孔结构的材料，从而增强其催化性能。

3. 这些材料的合成方法通常涉及使用碱溶液处理传统沸石，以选择性地去除某些成分（如硅酸盐），从而创造出具有介孔结构的材料。将金属如Sn和Pt引入这些材料中会导致形成双金属催化剂，由于金属粒子被限制在介孔中，它们在高温下稳定，并且能够更有效地进行丙烷脱氢反应。
