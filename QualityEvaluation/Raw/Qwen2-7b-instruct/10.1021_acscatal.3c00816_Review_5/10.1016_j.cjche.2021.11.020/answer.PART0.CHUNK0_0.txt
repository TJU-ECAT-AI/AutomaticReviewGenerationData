[1] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature. Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate."
[2] "Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition."
[3] "The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5."
[4] "The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by allowing smaller molecules to enter through micropores while larger molecules can diffuse through mesopores. This dual-pore system improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, which often lack sufficient mesopore structure. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites are synthesized by treating conventional ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solutions under mild conditions, which creates a hierarchical structure with both micropores and mesopores. The introduction of Sn and Pt species into this structure leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts. The high efficiency of these catalysts in PDH reactions is primarily due to the confinement of PtSn particles within the mesopores of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, which stabilizes the particles at high temperatures and accelerates diffusion rates.

层状沸石通过将微孔和介孔/大孔结合，提高了PDH反应的可接近性，允许较小的分子通过微孔进入，而较大的分子可以通过介孔扩散。这种双孔系统与传统沸石相比改进了PDH反应性能，后者往往缺乏足够的介孔结构。通过温和条件下的碱溶液处理常规沸石，可以合成具有微孔和介孔的层状沸石。向此结构中引入Sn和Pt物种导致形成Pt-Sn/层状沸石催化剂。这些催化剂在PDH反应中的高效率主要归因于PtSn颗粒被限制在层状沸石的介孔内，这在高温下稳定了颗粒，并加速了扩散速率。
