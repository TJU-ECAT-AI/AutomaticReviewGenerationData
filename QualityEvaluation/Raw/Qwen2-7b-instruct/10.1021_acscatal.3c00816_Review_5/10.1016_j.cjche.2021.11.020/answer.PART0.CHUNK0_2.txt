[1] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature. Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."
[2] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition."
[3] "The effects of the concentrations of alkali solution and Sn/Pt ratios on the catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 were systematically studied, and it is found that the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst shows the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, which gives an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570 C."

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by confining PtSn particles within mesopores, stabilizing them at high temperatures, and accelerating diffusion rates. This allows for easier access of propane to PtSn particles for dehydrogenation and faster diffusion of propylene out, reducing cracking and coking. The hierarchical ZSM-5 is synthesized through a mild treatment of ZSM-5 with alkali solution, leading to the formation of hierarchical structures with improved catalytic performance. Among various PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst exhibits the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, achieving an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570°C.

层状沸石通过在介孔中限制PtSn颗粒，以高温度稳定它们，并加速扩散速率来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这使得丙烷可以更容易地接近PtSn颗粒进行脱氢，而丙烯的扩散也变得更快，从而减少了裂解和结焦反应。通过温和的碱溶液处理ZSM-5制备出层状结构，从而形成了具有改进催化性能的层状沸石。在各种PtSn/层状沸石催化剂中，PtSn1.00/层状沸石(0.8)催化剂在570°C时表现出最高的PDH效率，初始转化率为46%，选择性为98%。
