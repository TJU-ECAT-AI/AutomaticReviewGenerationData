          [1] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature. Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate."
          [2] "Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition."
          [3] "The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5."
          [4] "The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by confining PtSn particles within mesopores, stabilizing them at high temperatures, and accelerating diffusion rates. This allows for easier access of propane to PtSn particles for dehydrogenation and faster diffusion of propylene out, reducing cracking and coking. The hierarchical ZSM-5 is synthesized through a mild treatment of ZSM-5 with alkali solution, leading to the formation of hierarchical structures with improved catalytic performance. Among various PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst exhibits the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, achieving an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570°C.

          层级沸石通过在介孔中限制PtSn颗粒，以高温度稳定它们，并加速扩散速率来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这使得丙烷可以更容易地接近PtSn颗粒进行脱氢，而丙烯的扩散也变得更快，从而减少了裂解和结焦反应。通过温和的碱溶液处理ZSM-5制备出层状结构，从而形成了具有改进催化性能的层状沸石。在各种PtSn/层状沸石催化剂中，PtSn1.00/层状沸石(0.8)催化剂在570°C时表现出最高的PDH效率，初始转化率为46%，选择性为98%。

          The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those synthesized through treatments of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solutions under mild conditions, leading to the formation of mesopores within the microporous structure. This method enables the creation of materials with both micropores and mesopores/macropores. The synthesis involves the creation of mesopores followed by the loading of metals like Sn and Pt into the hierarchical zeolite structure, resulting in Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts. These catalysts show very high stability, selectivity, and activity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction to form propylene.

          主要类型的层级沸石包括通过将ZSM-5沸石用碱溶液在温和条件下处理来合成的材料，这导致在微孔结构内形成介孔。这种方法允许在具有微孔和介孔/大孔的材料中创建多个通道。合成过程包括创造介孔，然后将金属如Sn和Pt加载到层级沸石结构中，从而形成Pt-Sn/层级ZSM-5催化剂。这些催化剂在将丙烷转化为丙烯的反应中表现出极高的稳定性、选择性和活性。
