[1] "The severe conditions required in some processes, where high temperatures are frequently combined with the presence of steam, highlight the need of considering the evolution of the catalyst structure during the reaction."
[2] "Zeolites are employed as catalysts in many different processes of industrial relevance, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction, dehydration of alcohols, alkylation, hydroxylation, and epoxidation, among others."
[3] "These processes make the catalyst vulnerable to structural degradation and hence possessing high hydrothermal stability is a must for its longer catalytic lifetime."
[4] "For instance, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) needs to be treated above 650 C on a regular basis to burn off all the particulate matter (PM) that got trapped within its porous network."
[5] "Moreover, before reactions, a pre-treatment of the catalyst at high temperatures is required for the regeneration of their catalytic properties."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-scale pore system. This allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, facilitating the reaction kinetics. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and zeolite-metal hybrids. Synthesis methods typically involve incorporating mesoporous or macroporous materials into the zeolite framework, often through impregnation, sol-gel processes, or templating methods. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering increased surface area, better pore connectivity, and potentially improved thermal stability. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, as well as improved resistance to structural degradation under high-temperature conditions.

层次结构沸石通过提供多尺度孔系统来增强PDH反应的可接近性。这允许更好地扩散反应物和产物，促进反应动力学。层次结构沸石的主要类型包括介孔沸石、大孔沸石和沸石金属杂化物。合成方法通常涉及在沸石框架中引入介孔或大孔材料，通常是通过浸渍、溶胶-凝胶过程或模板方法。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供增加的比表面积、更好的孔连通性和可能的改善热稳定性来提高PDH反应性能。这导致增强的催化活性和选择性，以及在高温条件下对结构退化的更好抵抗能力。
