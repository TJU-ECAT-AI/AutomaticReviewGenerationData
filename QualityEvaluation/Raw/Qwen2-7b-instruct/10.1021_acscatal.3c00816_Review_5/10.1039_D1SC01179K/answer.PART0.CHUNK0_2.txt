1. Zeolites have been utilized in various industrial catalytic reactions, particularly in processes requiring severe conditions, such as high temperatures and steam presence. The evolution of the catalyst structure during the reaction is crucial for maintaining hydrothermal stability.

2. Zeolites are applied in diverse industrial processes, including fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) reactions, alcohol dehydration, alkylation, hydroxylation, and epoxidation, among others.

3. Extra-framework phosphorus species have been shown to enhance the hydrothermal stability of Al-rich zeolites. This is particularly evident in the case of large pore zeolite Y, where rare earth cations like lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), and thulium (Tm) have demonstrated an improvement in thermal stability.

4. Extra-framework transition metal cations, specifically copper (Cu), contribute not only as active sites in several reactions but also stabilize the framework structure of zeolites. The detailed investigation of the Al distribution, Cu cation loadings, and active site nature in Cu-SSZ-13 materials has been carried out due to their commercial use as robust catalysts in the NH3SCR process.

1. 硅铝酸盐在工业相关的重要催化反应中被成功应用。在需要高温和蒸汽存在的极端条件下，考虑催化剂结构的演变对于维持热稳定性至关重要。

2. 硅铝酸盐应用于多种工业过程，包括流化床催化裂化（FCC）、选择性催化还原（SCR）、甲醇制烃（MTH）反应、醇脱水、烷基化、羟基化和环氧化等。

3. 外部框架磷素物种已被证明能增强铝基硅铝酸盐的热稳定性。在大孔硅铝酸盐Y中，镧（La）、铈（Ce）、钕（Nd）、钐（Sm）、钆（Gd）、铽（Tb）、镝（Dy）、钬（Ho）、铒（Er）和铥（Tm）等稀土离子的引入显著提高了催化剂的热稳定性。

4. 铜（Cu）等过渡金属的外框架物种不仅作为多个反应的活性位点，还能稳定硅铝酸盐的骨架结构。对铜基SSZ-13材料中铝分布、铜离子负载以及活性位点性质的详细研究，是因为它们作为NH3SCR过程中的高效催化剂而被商业化应用。
