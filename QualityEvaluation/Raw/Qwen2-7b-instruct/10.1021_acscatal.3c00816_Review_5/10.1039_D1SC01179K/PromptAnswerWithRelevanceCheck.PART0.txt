<quotes>
[1] "The severe conditions required in some processes, where high temperatures are frequently combined with the presence of steam, highlight the need of considering the evolution of the catalyst structure during the reaction."
[2] "Zeolites are employed as catalysts in many different processes of industrial relevance, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction, dehydration of alcohols, alkylation, hydroxylation, and epoxidation, among others."
[3] "These processes make the catalyst vulnerable to structural degradation and hence possessing high hydrothermal stability is a must for its longer catalytic lifetime."
[4] "For instance, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) needs to be treated above 650 C on a regular basis to burn off all the particulate matter (PM) that got trapped within its porous network."
[5] "Moreover, before reactions, a pre-treatment of the catalyst at high temperatures is required for the regeneration of their catalytic properties."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-scale pore system. This allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, facilitating the reaction kinetics. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and zeolite-metal hybrids. Synthesis methods typically involve incorporating mesoporous or macroporous materials into the zeolite framework, often through impregnation, sol-gel processes, or templating methods. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering increased surface area, better pore connectivity, and potentially improved thermal stability. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, as well as improved resistance to structural degradation under high-temperature conditions.

[5] "Under severe dealumination conditions, excessive extraction of Al causes the removal of some Si atoms together with the Al atoms from the framework forming mesopores and structural defects that decrease the framework stability, resulting in a total or partial amorphization of the structure."
[6] "Based on the knowledge gained from experimental results, several approaches have been developed to overcome the lack of hydrothermal stability of zeolitic materials."

1. Zeolites have been utilized in various industrial catalytic reactions due to their effectiveness. 

2. Diesel particulate filters (DPFs) require periodic treatments at temperatures above 650°C to burn off trapped particulate matter (PM).

3. Pre-treatment of catalysts at high temperatures is necessary for regenerating their catalytic properties before reactions.

4. High hydrothermal stability is crucial for zeolite catalysts to maintain their performance over time, as they are susceptible to structural degradation under severe conditions.

5. When subjected to severe dealumination, zeolites experience a loss of both Al and Si atoms, leading to the formation of mesopores and structural defects that diminish their stability and potentially result in the total or partial amorphization of the structure.

6. Various strategies have been devised based on experimental evidence to improve the hydrothermal stability of zeolitic materials.
