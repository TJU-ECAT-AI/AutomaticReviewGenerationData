[1] "Zeolites have been successfully employed in many catalytic reactions of industrial relevance."
[2] "For instance, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) needs to be treated above 650 C on a regular basis to burn off all the particulate matter (PM) that got trapped within its porous network."
[3] "Moreover, before reactions, a pre-treatment of the catalyst at high temperatures is required for the regeneration of their catalytic properties."
[4] "These processes make the catalyst vulnerable to structural degradation and hence possessing high hydrothermal stability is a must for its longer catalytic lifetime."
[5] "Under severe dealumination conditions, excessive extraction of Al causes the removal of some Si atoms together with the Al atoms from the framework forming mesopores and structural defects that decrease the framework stability, resulting in a total or partial amorphization of the structure."
[6] "Based on the knowledge gained from experimental results, several approaches have been developed to overcome the lack of hydrothermal stability of zeolitic materials."

1. Zeolites have been utilized in various industrial catalytic reactions due to their effectiveness. 

2. Diesel particulate filters (DPFs) require periodic treatments at temperatures above 650°C to burn off trapped particulate matter (PM).

3. Pre-treatment of catalysts at high temperatures is necessary for regenerating their catalytic properties before reactions.

4. High hydrothermal stability is crucial for zeolite catalysts to maintain their performance over time, as they are susceptible to structural degradation under severe conditions.

5. When subjected to severe dealumination, zeolites experience a loss of both Al and Si atoms, leading to the formation of mesopores and structural defects that diminish their stability and potentially result in the total or partial amorphization of the structure.

6. Various strategies have been devised based on experimental evidence to improve the hydrothermal stability of zeolitic materials.

1. 硅铝酸盐在工业相关催化反应中得到了成功应用。

2. 柴油颗粒过滤器（DPF）需要定期在高于650°C的温度下处理，以燃烧掉其多孔网络中捕获的颗粒物。

3. 在反应前，对催化剂进行高温预处理是必要的，以恢复其催化性能。

4. 高水热稳定性对于保持催化性能，防止硅铝酸盐催化剂在严重条件下发生结构降解至关重要。

5. 当硅铝酸盐在严重脱铝条件下处理时，会发生Al和Si原子的丢失，导致形成介孔和结构缺陷，降低其稳定性，可能导致结构的完全或部分非晶化。

6. 根据实验结果，已经开发出了几种策略来提高硅铝酸盐材料的水热稳定性。
