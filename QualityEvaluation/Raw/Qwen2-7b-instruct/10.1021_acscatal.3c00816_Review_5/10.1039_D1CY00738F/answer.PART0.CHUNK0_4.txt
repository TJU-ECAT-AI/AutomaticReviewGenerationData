The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level pore structure that allows for better control of reactant and product diffusion and adsorption. The main types of these materials include zeolites with tunable pore sizes, mesoporous zeolites, and hybrid zeolite-macroporous materials. They improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by facilitating more efficient activation of reactants, enhanced selectivity for products, and reduced formation of byproducts. The specific synthesis methods involve hydrothermal processes, sol-gel techniques, and template-directed assembly, among others, tailored to achieve desired pore structures and metal loading.
