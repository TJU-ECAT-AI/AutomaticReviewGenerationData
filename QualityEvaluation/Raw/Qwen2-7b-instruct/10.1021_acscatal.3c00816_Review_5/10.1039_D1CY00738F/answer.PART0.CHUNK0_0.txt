[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[2] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[3] "This is attributed to the strong effect of the zeolite skeleton on the enclosed Pt clusters, which was verified by the above EXAFS results and following DFT calculations."
[4] "The current work demonstrates that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of structure is not beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions and deeps the understanding of this type of catalyst."

1. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of the X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and improved propylene selectivity compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where the Pt clusters were inside the X-zeolite. 
2. Less coke deposition and high stability were observed in the Pt/NaX catalyst after the reaction for 18 hours.
3. The strong effect of the zeolite skeleton on the enclosed Pt clusters, as confirmed by EXAFS results and subsequent DFT calculations, was attributed to the enhanced performance of the Pt/NaX catalyst.
4. This study reveals that the surrounding zeolite framework may not benefit all specific catalytic reactions, deepening the understanding of this type of catalyst.

1. 外部位于X沸石中的铂簇的NaX催化剂与内部位于X沸石中的铂簇的NaX催化剂相比，外部位于X沸石中的铂簇的NaX催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯时的周转频率（TOF）提高了1100%，并显著提高了丙烯的选择性。
2. 在反应后18小时，观察到NaX催化剂中较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。
3. 由EXAFS结果和随后的DFT计算确认的X沸石骨架对封装铂簇的强烈影响被归因于NaX催化剂的增强性能。
4. 本研究揭示了周围沸石框架可能不适合所有特定催化反应，加深了对这种催化剂的理解。
