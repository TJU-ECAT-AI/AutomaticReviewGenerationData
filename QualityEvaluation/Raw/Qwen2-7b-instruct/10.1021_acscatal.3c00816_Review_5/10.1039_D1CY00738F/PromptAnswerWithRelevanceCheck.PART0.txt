[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[2] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[3] "This is attributed to the strong effect of the zeolite skeleton on the enclosed Pt clusters, which was verified by the above EXAFS results and following DFT calculations."
[4] "The current work demonstrates that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of structure is not beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions and deeps the understanding of this type of catalyst."

</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The surrounding zeolitic framework has a significant passivating effect on Pt clusters for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This effect is mainly attributed to the modulation of the d-band center of the Pt clusters, which decreases their ability to activate propane and prevents the desorption of propylene. This leads to a reduction in propylene selectivity and an increase in coke deposition.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
此类型的结构中，金属簇周围的沸石环境对其某些特定催化反应并无益处，并加深了对此类催化剂的理解。这种影响主要归因于沸石骨架对铂簇d能带中心的显著调节，这降低了铂簇激活丙烷的能力并阻止了丙烯的脱附，导致丙烯选择性的降低和焦炭沉积的增加。

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible pathways for reactants and products. The main types of these materials include zeolites with varying pore sizes and shapes, such as MFI, MCM-41, and SBA-15. The synthesis methods typically involve template-directed assembly, sol-gel processing, and hydrothermal treatment. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reactions by increasing the catalytic surface area, facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products, and enhancing the stability and activity of the catalyst.

2. The hierarchical zeolites, especially those with metal clusters enclosed within, show remarkable performance in PDH reactions. Metal clusters, such as Pt, confined in the zeolite cages can exhibit enhanced catalytic activity due to the unique properties of zeolites. These include the ability to protect the active sites against sintering and poisoning, shape selectivity based on the size of the zeolitic cages, and quantum confinement effects that alter the optical and electrical properties of the metal species. Compared to traditional supported catalysts, the hierarchical zeolites can provide more efficient and selective conversions of propane to propylene, as well as better stability under reaction conditions.

1. 多级孔结构的沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，增强了PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括具有不同孔径和形状的沸石，如MFI、MCM-41和SBA-15。合成方法通常涉及模板导向组装、溶胶-凝胶处理和水热法。与传统沸石相比，多级孔结构的沸石在PDH反应中通过增加催化表面积、改善反应物和产物的扩散途径以及提高催化剂的稳定性和活性，从而提高了PDH反应的效率。

2. 特别是包含金属簇的多级孔沸石，在PDH反应中表现出卓越的性能。例如，封装在沸石笼中的Pt簇，由于沸石的独特性质，可以显示出增强的催化活性。这些性质包括保护活性位点免受聚集和中毒的影响、基于沸石笼尺寸的形状选择性，以及量子约束效应，这些效应改变了金属物种的光学和电学性质。与传统的负载型催化剂相比，多级孔结构的沸石能够提供更高效的丙烷到丙烯转化率，以及更好的稳定性，在反应条件下。

[2] "The Pt species in Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX gave a larger white line than that in Pt foil, and the Pt species in Pt@NaX showed a white line with the highest intensity among these samples."
[3] "The Pt clusters in Pt/NaX showed only very slight growth after the prolonged reaction time of 10 h at 500 C, which was because a small amount of Pt clusters was not enclosed in the X-zeolite, indicating that most of the Pt clusters were successfully protected against aggregation by the X-zeolite skeleton."
[4] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[5] "The catalytic activity of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX can be attributed to the different electronic states of their Pt clusters rather than the size effect."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level pore structure that allows for better control of reactant and product diffusion and adsorption. The main types of these materials include zeolites with tunable pore sizes, mesoporous zeolites, and hybrid zeolite-macroporous materials. They improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by facilitating more efficient activation of reactants, enhanced selectivity for products, and reduced formation of byproducts. The specific synthesis methods involve hydrothermal processes, sol-gel techniques, and template-directed assembly, among others, tailored to achieve desired pore structures and metal loading.
