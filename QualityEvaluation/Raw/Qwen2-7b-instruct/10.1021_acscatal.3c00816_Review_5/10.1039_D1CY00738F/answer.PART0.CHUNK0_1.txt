[1] "The current work demonstrates that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of structure is not beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions and deeps the understanding of this type of catalyst."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The surrounding zeolitic framework has a significant passivating effect on Pt clusters for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This effect is mainly attributed to the modulation of the d-band center of the Pt clusters, which decreases their ability to activate propane and prevents the desorption of propylene. This leads to a reduction in propylene selectivity and an increase in coke deposition.

此类型的结构中，金属簇周围的沸石环境对其某些特定催化反应并无益处，并加深了对此类催化剂的理解。这种影响主要归因于沸石骨架对铂簇d能带中心的显著调节，这降低了铂簇激活丙烷的能力并阻止了丙烯的脱附，导致丙烯选择性的降低和焦炭沉积的增加。
