[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[2] "The Pt species in Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX gave a larger white line than that in Pt foil, and the Pt species in Pt@NaX showed a white line with the highest intensity among these samples."
[3] "The Pt clusters in Pt/NaX showed only very slight growth after the prolonged reaction time of 10 h at 500 C, which was because a small amount of Pt clusters was not enclosed in the X-zeolite, indicating that most of the Pt clusters were successfully protected against aggregation by the X-zeolite skeleton."
[4] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[5] "The catalytic activity of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX can be attributed to the different electronic states of their Pt clusters rather than the size effect."

1. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where the Pt clusters were inside the X-zeolite.

2. The Pt species in the Pt clusters enclosed in the zeolite, Pt@NaX, and those on the exterior, Pt/NaX, exhibited a larger white line in their XANES spectra, with the Pt species in Pt@NaX having the highest intensity, indicating electron deficiency.

3. Most of the Pt clusters in Pt/NaX were successfully protected against aggregation by the X-zeolite skeleton, as evidenced by only slight growth of the Pt clusters after a prolonged reaction time at 500°C.

4. Pt/NaX exhibited less coke deposition and maintained high stability after the reaction for 18 hours.

5. The enhanced catalytic activity of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX was attributed to the distinct electronic states of their Pt clusters, rather than cluster size.

1. 外部位于X沸石中的Pt簇催化剂（Pt/NaX）相对于内部固定在X沸石中的Pt簇催化剂（Pt@NaX），其周转频率（TOF）提高了1100%，丙烯选择性显著提高。

2. Pt@NaX和Pt/NaX中Pt簇的Pt物种在XANES光谱中的白线较大，且Pt@NaX的白线强度最高，表明电子缺陷。

3. 绝大多数Pt簇在Pt/NaX中成功地由X沸石骨架保护，避免了聚合，仅显示轻微生长，在500°C下反应10小时后。

4. Pt/NaX表现出较少的焦炭沉积，并在18小时反应后保持高稳定性。

5. Pt@NaX和Pt/NaX的增强催化活性归因于它们的Pt簇的明显不同的电子状态，而不是簇大小。
