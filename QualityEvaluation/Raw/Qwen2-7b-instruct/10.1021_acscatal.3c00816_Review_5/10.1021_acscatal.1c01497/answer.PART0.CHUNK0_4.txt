1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by integrating both types of pores within the material structure. This design allows for better interaction between reactants and catalyst sites.
2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include ZSM-5, MFI, and MOR. These materials are synthesized through various methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel process, and template-directed synthesis.
3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore structure and increased accessibility, which facilitates more efficient reactant diffusion and product release.
