Understanding the correlation between gallium speciation and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts involves recognizing how hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include templated synthesis, sol-gel method, and microwave-assisted synthesis. These materials significantly improve the performance of PDH reactions by offering a larger surface area and better pore structure.
