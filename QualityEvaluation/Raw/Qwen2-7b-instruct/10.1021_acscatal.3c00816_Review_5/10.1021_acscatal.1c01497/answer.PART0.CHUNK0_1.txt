1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores or macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials consist of ZSM-5, MFI, and MOR. Synthesis processes usually incorporate template agents and high-temperature treatments. Compared to conventional zeolites, these materials enhance PDH reaction performance thanks to their improved pore structure and surface area.
