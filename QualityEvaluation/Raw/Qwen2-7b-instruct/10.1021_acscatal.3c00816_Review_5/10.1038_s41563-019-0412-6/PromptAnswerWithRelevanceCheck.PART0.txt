[1] "One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4."
[2] "For instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selectively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental challenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due to differences in geometric and confinement effects."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction18."
[4] "Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions."
[5] "To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials."
[6] "The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position."
[7] "Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels."
[8] "A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species19,20,21."
[9] "Finally, atomically dispersed Sn species can also be introduced to electronically modify the Pt clusters to increase propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[10] "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species."
[11] "As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3)."
[12] "To investigate the role of K, we first characterized the as-synthesized, non-calcined, Pt-zeolite samples (K-Pt@MFI-SDA and Pt@MFI-SDA), obtained in the presence and absence of K, by electron microscopy."
[13] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids."
[14] "This regioselective distribution of Pt species may be caused by the occupation of the intersectional voids by the template (TPA+), as well as by the availability of larger spaces in the sinusoidal channels compared with the straight channels (Supplementary Fig. 7)24,25,26."
[15] "The characteristics of the location of Pt atoms described above are the same when the synthesis is carried out in the presence of K+ (K-Pt@MFI-SDA sample), indicating that K+ does not play a relevant role in the encapsulation of atomically dispersed Pt species during the hydrothermal synthesis."
[16] "Interestingly, when the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sample was reduced in H2 at 600C, Pt atoms turned into subnanometric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d."
[17] "Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that subnanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels)."
[18] "Therefore, we have analysed the HR HAADF-STEM results in further detail."
[19] "By using the newly developed iDPC technique, the atomic structure of the MFI zeolite can be recorded simultaneously with the HR HAADF-STEM image under low-dose conditions (Fig. 3b)22,23."
[20] "As presented in Fig. 3d, the detailed structure of the MFI zeolite can be clearly identified in the iDPC image, even the 5R units in the framework."
[21] "The location of Pt clusters has also been confirmed by STEM-iDPC imaging on a zeolite crystallite with the tilted-[010] orientation (see Fig. 3eh), showing that the subnanometric Pt clusters overlap with the sinusoidal channels."
[22] "According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples."
[23] "As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the K-free PtSn@MFI has a first-shell NPtPt of about 10.7, corresponding to Pt nanoparticles of 45nm, while a first-shell NPtPt of about 6.4 is found for the K-PtSn@MFI sample, corresponding to an average size of about 0.9nm."
[24] "These results further confirm the critical role of K+ in stabilizing subnanometric Pt species18,19,20."
[25] "According to our simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38), it is possible to differentiate single Pt and Sn atoms from the zeolite framework."
[26] "Considering the average particle size obtained from the EXAFS results, the number of singly dispersed Pt atoms in the K-Pt@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples should be low and Pt should mainly exist as subnanometric clusters (Supplementary Fig. 41)."
[27] "As displayed in Fig. 4af, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping."
[28] "However, due to the resolution limitation, it is not possible to determine the relative spatial relationship between Sn and Pt."
[29] "To overcome the limitation of XEDS on such beam-sensitive samples, we have attempted, on the basis of the imaging simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 4244), to discriminate Pt and Sn distributions by a k-means clustering analysis of the HR HAADF-STEM images."
[30] "As shown in Fig. 4gi, subnanometric Pt and Sn species can be identified according to their different contrasts in the HR HAADF-STEM images."
[31] "Then, in the image depicting the distribution of the Pt and Sn species (Fig. 4h) after k-means clustering, it is possible to pick out the Pt and Sn species that are in contact, simply by selecting those that fall at a distance shorter than 0.1nm in Fig. 4h."
[32] "As a result, it is possible to estimate the presence of bimetallic PtSn clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample that are made up of two neighbouring Pt and Sn units rather than alloyed clusters, as shown in Fig. 4h."
[33] "The statistical analysis shows that about 40% of the subnanometric metal clusters automatically detected in the experimental image of Fig. 4g fall at a distance below 0.1nm."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by strategically locating active sites within the desired pore or cavity type. This is crucial for catalytic applications due to the differences in geometric and confinement effects. Main types of these materials include zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of varying dimensions. Synthesis methods involve one-pot strategies that incorporate template molecules, like TPA+OH, to occupy specific voids and limit the access of metal species. Controlling the synthesis conditions, such as the introduction of K+ ions to stabilize subnanometric Pt species, also plays a significant role in enhancing material properties.

2. The performance of PDH reactions is improved in hierarchical zeolites compared to traditional zeolites due to the strategic location of active sites, which optimizes reactivity and selectivity. The enhanced accessibility facilitated by the combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores allows for better interaction between reactants and catalysts, leading to higher efficiency and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

3. The introduction of atomically dispersed Sn species electronically modifies the Pt clusters, increasing propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. This synergistic effect between Pt and Sn leads to improved stability and reactivity under high-temperature conditions, making the resulting catalysts highly effective for industrial applications.

4. The one-pot synthesis method is a key technique for generating stable subnanometric Pt species within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite. This is achieved by controlling the synthesis parameters, such as the presence of template molecules and K+ ions, to stabilize the Pt species. The resulting catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions, offering new possibilities for industrial catalytic applications.

5. The use of two complementary STEM-based techniques, HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC, enables the study of the precise location of metal species at the atomic level within heterogeneous metal catalysts. This approach can be generalized for understanding the position of metal species in various crystalline porous materials, including metalorganic frameworks and zeolites.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pore sizes for different reactant and product sizes, improving diffusion rates and reducing steric hindrance. Main types include zeolites with different pore sizes, such as MFI, BEA, and ZSM-5, synthesized via hydrothermal methods. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating better control over reactant and product interactions, leading to higher conversion and selectivity.

2. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites involves hydrothermal methods where metal precursors are incorporated during the synthesis process to create metal-zeolite composites. These composites often exhibit a combination of microporous and mesoporous structures. They are synthesized by controlling the reaction conditions, such as pH, temperature, and metal salt concentration, to achieve desired pore sizes and morphologies.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites enhance PDH reaction performance through improved pore architecture and metal dispersion. They offer better selectivity and stability, as well as higher activity due to optimized pore environments for reactants and products. The controlled distribution of metal species within the hierarchical structure allows for more efficient catalytic activity and resistance to sintering at high temperatures.

<p>Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4.</p>
<p>Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550C) under a reductive atmosphere12,13.</p>
<p>However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast deactivation, and the subsequent regenerationreaction cycles will lead to severe sintering of Pt. Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species.</p>
<p>A subsequent calcination in air at 600C to remove the organic template in the as-synthesized Pt-MFI materials gives rise to the formation of Pt nanoparticles in the K-free Pt@MFI-air sample, indicating the migration and subsequent sintering of Pt.</p>
<p>However, as presented in Supplementary Fig. 10, Pt remains atomically dispersed after calcination in air in the K-Pt@MFI-air sample.</p>
<p>When the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sample was reduced in H2 at 600C, Pt atoms turned into subnanometric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, when the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sample was reduced in H2 at 600C, Pt atoms turned into subnanometric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d.</p>
<p>The low white-line intensity in the Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of the K-Pt@MFI sample (Fig. 2a) indicates the presence of metallic Pt after the H2 reduction treatment.</p>
<p>According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples.</p>
<p>The idea that Sn species are well dispersed within the K-PtSn@MFI sample is supported by the EXAFS spectrum, since no additional higher shells are observed.</p>
<p>As shown in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 and 1,719cm1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters.</p>
<p>According to our simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38), it is possible to differentiate single Pt and Sn atoms from the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>As displayed in Fig. 4af, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the experimental HR HAADF-STEM images of the K-PtSn@MFI sample, we have found areas showing intensity profiles similar to those observed in simulation results (Supplementary Fig. 45).</p>
<p>According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced.</p>
<p>For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.41.2nm.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level.</p>

The document discusses the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites that combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials are synthesized using various methods that aim to locate active sites in the desired framework or extraframework positions. The synthesis of zeolites involves controlling the pore sizes and shapes to improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The hierarchical zeolites achieve this by providing a regular distribution of metal clusters within the zeolite structure, which enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst. The document also mentions the use of potassium (K) and tin (Sn) to stabilize the metal clusters, prevent sintering, and modulate the electronic structure of the Pt clusters. The enhanced stability and reactivity of the Pt clusters in the zeolite framework result in improved performance for PDH reactions. The document also highlights the importance of using advanced imaging techniques, such as HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC, to study the position of metal species at the atomic level in heterogeneous metal catalysts.

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a large surface area and controlled pore sizes. The main types of these materials include zeolites, metalorganic frameworks, and other crystalline porous materials. They are synthesized through various methods, such as hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel process, and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better stability, selectivity, and activity due to the regioselective localization of subnanometric metal species, particularly Pt and PtSn clusters, in specific sites within the zeolite framework. This localization prevents the sintering of metal particles at high temperatures, enhancing their catalytic efficiency.
