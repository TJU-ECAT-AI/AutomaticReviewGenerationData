The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a large surface area and controlled pore sizes. The main types of these materials include zeolites, metalorganic frameworks, and other crystalline porous materials. They are synthesized through various methods, such as hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel process, and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better stability, selectivity, and activity due to the regioselective localization of subnanometric metal species, particularly Pt and PtSn clusters, in specific sites within the zeolite framework. This localization prevents the sintering of metal particles at high temperatures, enhancing their catalytic efficiency.

这些分级沸石通过提供大量表面积和控制孔径大小，将微孔和介孔/大孔结合在一起，以增强PDH反应的可访问性。这些材料的主要类型包括沸石、金属有机框架和其他结晶多孔材料。它们通过多种方法合成，如水热合成、溶胶-凝胶过程和共价有机框架（COFs）。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在PDH反应中的性能得到提高，因为它们能够实现特定位点内纳米尺度金属物种（特别是Pt和PtSn簇）的区域选择性定位，这防止了高温下的金属颗粒聚集，从而提高了催化效率。
