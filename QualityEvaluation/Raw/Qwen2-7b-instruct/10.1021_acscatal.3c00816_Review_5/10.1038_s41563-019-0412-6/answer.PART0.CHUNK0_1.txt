[1] "Regioselective generation and reactivity control of subnanometric platinum clusters in zeolites for high-temperature catalysis."
[2] "Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4."
[3] "For instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selectively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental challenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due to differences in geometric and confinement effects."
[4] "However, when functional metals, such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal precursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, nanoparticles of 12nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeolite8,9,10,11."
[5] "As far as we know, the metal particles show random distribution within the zeolite crystallites."
[6] "To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials."
[7] "The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position."
[8] "Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels."
[9] "Finally, atomically dispersed Sn species can also be introduced to electronically modify the Pt clusters to increase propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[10] "Encapsulation of Pt particles in MFI zeolite"
[11] "As illustrated in Fig. 1a,b, by a one-pot synthesis strategy, Pt species can be encapsulated into purely siliceous MFI zeolite with a Pt loading of about 0.4wt% (Supplementary Table 1)."
[12] "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species."
[13] "To investigate the role of K, we first characterized the as-synthesized, non-calcined, Pt-zeolite samples (K-Pt@MFI-SDA and Pt@MFI-SDA), obtained in the presence and absence of K, by electron microscopy."
[14] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids."
[15] "This regioselective distribution of Pt species may be caused by the occupation of the intersectional voids by the template (TPA+), as well as by the availability of larger spaces in the sinusoidal channels compared with the straight channels (Supplementary Fig. 7)."
[16] "The characteristics of the location of Pt atoms described above are the same when the synthesis is carried out in the presence of K+ (K-Pt@MFI-SDA sample), indicating that K+ does not play a relevant role in the encapsulation of atomically dispersed Pt species during the hydrothermal synthesis."
[17] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, the number of OH groups in the K-free Pt-zeolite samples measured by infrared spectroscopy decreased significantly after the introduction of K+ (ref. 27)."
[18] "In the case of the K-Pt@MFI sample, as displayed in Fig. 1d, 0.40.6nm Pt clusters can be clearly observed as high-intensity areas along the [010] direction, while the 10MR straight channels appear as low-intensity pores."
[19] "Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that subnanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels)."
[20] "For the K-Pt@MFI sample, as displayed in Fig. 3a,c, 0.40.6nm Pt clusters can be clearly observed as high-intensity areas along the [010] direction, while the 10MR straight channels appear as low-intensity pores."
[21] "After reduction by H2 at 600C, large Pt nanoparticles are formed in the PtSn@MFI sample (Fig. 1e,i and Supplementary Fig. 26), while subnanometric Pt clusters (0.5nm) are formed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample (Fig. 1f,j and Supplementary Fig. 27)."
[22] "According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples."
[23] "As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the K-free PtSn@MFI has a first-shell NPtPt of about 10.7, corresponding to Pt nanoparticles of 45nm, while a first-shell NPtPt of about 6.4 is found for the K-PtSn@MFI sample, corresponding to an average size of about 0.9nm."
[24] "These results further confirm the critical role of K+ in stabilizing subnanometric Pt species18,19,20."
[25] "As can be seen in Fig. 3ip, subnanometric Pt and Sn species are also located in the 10MR sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite (see additional images in Supplementary Figs. 2933)."
[26] "According to our simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38), it is possible to differentiate single Pt and Sn atoms from the zeolite framework."
[27] "As displayed in Fig. 4af, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping."
[28] "However, when Sn was introduced as a promotor, the resultant PtSn@MFI showed a significantly enhanced activity and selectivity (Fig. 5b), in consistence with previous works on supported PtSn catalysts36,37."
[29] "According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced."
[30] "Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pore sizes for different reactant and product sizes, improving diffusion rates and reducing steric hindrance. Main types include zeolites with different pore sizes, such as MFI, BEA, and ZSM-5, synthesized via hydrothermal methods. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating better control over reactant and product interactions, leading to higher conversion and selectivity.

2. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites involves hydrothermal methods where metal precursors are incorporated during the synthesis process to create metal-zeolite composites. These composites often exhibit a combination of microporous and mesoporous structures. They are synthesized by controlling the reaction conditions, such as pH, temperature, and metal salt concentration, to achieve desired pore sizes and morphologies.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites enhance PDH reaction performance through improved pore architecture and metal dispersion. They offer better selectivity and stability, as well as higher activity due to optimized pore environments for reactants and products. The controlled distribution of metal species within the hierarchical structure allows for more efficient catalytic activity and resistance to sintering at high temperatures.
