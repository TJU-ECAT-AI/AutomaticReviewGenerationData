<p>Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4.</p>
<p>Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550C) under a reductive atmosphere12,13.</p>
<p>However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast deactivation, and the subsequent regenerationreaction cycles will lead to severe sintering of Pt. Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species.</p>
<p>A subsequent calcination in air at 600C to remove the organic template in the as-synthesized Pt-MFI materials gives rise to the formation of Pt nanoparticles in the K-free Pt@MFI-air sample, indicating the migration and subsequent sintering of Pt.</p>
<p>However, as presented in Supplementary Fig. 10, Pt remains atomically dispersed after calcination in air in the K-Pt@MFI-air sample.</p>
<p>When the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sample was reduced in H2 at 600C, Pt atoms turned into subnanometric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, when the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sample was reduced in H2 at 600C, Pt atoms turned into subnanometric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d.</p>
<p>The low white-line intensity in the Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of the K-Pt@MFI sample (Fig. 2a) indicates the presence of metallic Pt after the H2 reduction treatment.</p>
<p>According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples.</p>
<p>The idea that Sn species are well dispersed within the K-PtSn@MFI sample is supported by the EXAFS spectrum, since no additional higher shells are observed.</p>
<p>As shown in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 and 1,719cm1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters.</p>
<p>According to our simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38), it is possible to differentiate single Pt and Sn atoms from the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>As displayed in Fig. 4af, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the experimental HR HAADF-STEM images of the K-PtSn@MFI sample, we have found areas showing intensity profiles similar to those observed in simulation results (Supplementary Fig. 45).</p>
<p>According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced.</p>
<p>For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.41.2nm.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level.</p>

The document discusses the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites that combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials are synthesized using various methods that aim to locate active sites in the desired framework or extraframework positions. The synthesis of zeolites involves controlling the pore sizes and shapes to improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The hierarchical zeolites achieve this by providing a regular distribution of metal clusters within the zeolite structure, which enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst. The document also mentions the use of potassium (K) and tin (Sn) to stabilize the metal clusters, prevent sintering, and modulate the electronic structure of the Pt clusters. The enhanced stability and reactivity of the Pt clusters in the zeolite framework result in improved performance for PDH reactions. The document also highlights the importance of using advanced imaging techniques, such as HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC, to study the position of metal species at the atomic level in heterogeneous metal catalysts.

文档讨论了结合微孔和介孔/大孔的分级沸石，以提高PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料通过多种方法合成，旨在将活性位点定位在所需的框架或额外框架位置。沸石的合成涉及控制孔大小和形状，以改善PDH反应性能与传统沸石相比。分级沸石通过在沸石结构中提供金属簇的均匀分布来实现这一点，从而增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。文档还提到使用钾（K）和锡（Sn）稳定金属簇，防止聚集，并调节铂簇的电子结构。铂簇在沸石框架中的增强稳定性和活性导致PDH反应性能的改进。文档还强调了使用高级成像技术，如HR HAADF-STEM和iDPC，研究异质金属催化剂中金属物种的原子级位置的重要性。
