[1] "A number of works have addressed propane conversion and propylene selectivity of PDH reactions. Wu et al. (21) used a Pd/Ag composite hollow fiber MR by depositing <1 μm sized Pt (0.5 wt %)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for the PDH reaction."
[2] "The silicalite membrane was investigated for equimolar H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 separation from room temperature to 600 C (Figure 4)."
[3] "As temperature increases, diffusion dominates separation and smaller H2 diffuses faster than C3H8 and C3H6, and thus, H2 permeance increases faster with increasing temperature, which further causes the increase in H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 separation factors, 5.7 and 4.4 at 600 C, respectively."
[4] "For PBMR, the model calculated a little higher values than experimental values possibly because the permeance of C3H8, C3H6, and H2 was considered constant in calculation, but the permeance values decreased over time due to coke deposition on the membrane surface during the experiment."
[5] "The model predicted the propane conversion results very well for both PBMR and PBR. The highest propane conversion predicted in the modeling was 99% at a WHSV of 1.1 h1, a pressure of 3.0 atm, and an A/A0 of 1.5."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants and products. Main types of these materials include silicalite, MCM-41, and SBA-15. Synthesis methods often involve sol-gel processes, template-directed synthesis, and secondary growth techniques. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by increasing the reaction rates and selectivities through enhanced diffusion pathways and better control over pore sizes.

2. The silicalite membrane was investigated for its ability to separate equimolar mixtures of H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 over a temperature range from room temperature to 600°C. As the temperature increased, the membrane became more selective towards hydrogen, leading to an increase in the separation factors for both mixtures. This is attributed to the shift from adsorption-dominated separation at lower temperatures to diffusion-dominated separation at higher temperatures.

3. The increase in separation factors at higher temperatures is due to the dominance of diffusion over adsorption. At room temperature, adsorption is the primary mechanism for separation, resulting in a preference for hydrocarbons like C3H8 and C3H6 over hydrogen. As temperature rises, the rate of diffusion becomes the limiting factor, allowing hydrogen to diffuse more quickly than the hydrocarbons. This results in a faster increase in hydrogen permeance and, consequently, higher separation factors for both mixtures.

4. The model predicted that the permeance values for C3H8, C3H6, and H2 were assumed to be constant during the calculation, whereas in reality, these values decreased over time due to the deposition of coke on the membrane surface. This discrepancy between the model and experimental data highlights the importance of accounting for the dynamic changes in permeance in the modeling of PDH reactions.

5. The model accurately predicted the propane conversion results for both PBMR and PBR, achieving the highest predicted propane conversion of 99% under specific operating conditions. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in simulating the performance of membrane reactors for PDH reactions, particularly in optimizing the operating conditions for enhanced performance.

1. 级联沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可访问性，提供更大的表面积和更易于访问的反应物和产物位点。主要类型包括硅铝沸石、MCM-41和SBA-15。合成方法通常涉及溶胶-凝胶过程、模板导向合成和二次生长技术。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过增加反应路径的扩散性和更好地控制孔径大小来提高PDH反应性能，从而提高反应速率和选择性。

2. 对硅铝沸石膜进行了研究，以评估其在从室温到600°C的温度范围内对等摩尔混合物H2/C3H8和H2/C3H6的分离能力。随着温度升高，膜变得更加选择性，氢气的分离因子分别增加了5.7和4.4倍。这种变化归因于从低温时吸附主导的分离机制向高温时扩散主导的分离机制的转变。

3. 温度升高导致分离因子增加的原因是扩散机制的主导作用。在室温下，吸附是主要的分离机制，导致氢气相对于C3H8和C3H6的偏好。随着温度升高，扩散速率成为限制因素，使得氢气比碳氢化合物更快地扩散。这导致氢气渗透率的快速增加，并且最终导致更高的分离因子。

4. 模型假设在计算中，C3H8、C3H6和H2的渗透率保持不变，而实际上，这些值由于实验过程中膜表面焦炭沉积而随时间降低。这一模型和实验数据之间的差异强调了在PDH反应的建模中考虑动态变化的渗透率的重要性。

5. 模型准确预测了PBMR和PBR的丙烷转化率结果，最高预测的丙烷转化率为99%，在特定操作条件下实现。这表明模型在模拟膜反应器PDH性能的有效性，特别是在优化操作条件以提高性能方面。
