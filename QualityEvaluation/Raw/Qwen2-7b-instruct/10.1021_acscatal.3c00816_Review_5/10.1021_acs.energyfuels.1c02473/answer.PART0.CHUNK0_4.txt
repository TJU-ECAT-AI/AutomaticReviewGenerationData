1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction and better distribution of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include silicalite, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Synthesis methods typically involve sol-gel processes, template-directed assembly, and co-assembly techniques. They improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering higher selectivity, faster kinetics, and enhanced capacity for hydrogen permeation.

2. The silicalite membrane demonstrated moderate separation capabilities for hydrogen and propane, yet it significantly augmented the performance of the PDH reaction in a packed-bed membrane reactor (PBMR). The maximum propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield achieved were 49%, 97%, and 47%, respectively, under conditions of 600°C, a space velocity of 1.1 h^-1, a sweep gas flow rate of 20 cm³/min, and a pressure of 5 atm.

3. Increasing the reaction pressure led to a reduction in methane selectivity for both packed-bed reactors (PBRs) and packed-bed membrane reactors (PBMRs).

4. The model accurately forecasted the propane conversion outcomes for both PBMRs and PBRs.

1. 多级孔材料通过提供更大的反应表面和更好的反应物及产物分布，将微孔和介孔/大孔结合在一起，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。这些材料的主要类型包括硅酸盐、咪唑框架杂环聚合物（ZIFs）和金属有机框架（MOFs）。合成方法通常涉及溶胶-凝胶过程、模板导向组装和共组装技术。与传统沸石相比，它们通过提供更高的选择性、更快的动力学和增强的氢渗透能力，改进了PDH反应。

2. 硅酸盐膜显示了氢和丙烷的中等分离性能，但显著提高了在膜床流化床反应器（PBMR）中的PDH反应性能。最大丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率分别为49%、97%和47%，条件为600°C、空间速度为1.1 h^-1、扫气流速为20 cm³/min和压力为5 atm。

3. 增加反应压力导致了对PBR和PBMR两者而言的甲烷选择性的降低。

4. 模型准确预测了PBMR和PBR中的丙烷转化率。
