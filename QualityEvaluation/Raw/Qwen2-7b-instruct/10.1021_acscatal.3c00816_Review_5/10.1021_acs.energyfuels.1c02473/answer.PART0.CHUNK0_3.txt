[1] "A one-dimensional (1D) plug flow reactor (PFR) model was developed for simulating the PBMR and PBR."
[2] "The maximum propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield obtained were 49, 97, and 47%, respectively, at 600 C, 1.1 h1, FAr = 20 cm3/min, and pressure = 5 atm."
[3] "The model predicted the propane conversion results very well for both PBMR and PBR."
