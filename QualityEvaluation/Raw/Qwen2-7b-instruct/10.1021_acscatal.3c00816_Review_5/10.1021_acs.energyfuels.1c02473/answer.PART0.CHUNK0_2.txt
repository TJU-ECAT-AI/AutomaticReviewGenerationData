[1] "The silicalite membrane showed a moderate separation performance for H2/propane, but using the membrane considerably helped in enhancing PDH reaction performance for PBMR."
[2] "The 1D PFR model was used not only to validate experimental results but also to predict reaction performance beyond experimental conditions."
[3] "The maximum propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield obtained were 49, 97, and 47%, respectively, at 600 C, 1.1 h1, FAr = 20 cm3/min, and pressure = 5 atm."
[4] "H2 recovery (RH2) increased with increasing pressure as more H2 was transferred to the permeate side, but permeate side H2 concentration (yH2,p) reduced with an increase in pressure because propane and unreacted propylene also diffuse across the membrane, which reduced the concentration of H2 in the permeate side."
[5] "Increasing reaction pressure reduced the methane selectivity for both PBMR and PBR."
[6] "The model predicted the propane conversion results very well for both PBMR and PBR."
[7] "The silicalite membrane was found to significantly enhance the propane conversion for the PDH reaction."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the catalyst and reactants. This structure allows for better diffusion of reactants into the zeolite and efficient removal of products, leading to enhanced reaction kinetics and selectivity.

2. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include ordered mesoporous materials (OMMs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). They are synthesized through various methods, such as template-directed self-assembly, polymerization, and coordination chemistry. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by offering precise pore sizes and shapes, as well as customizable surface functionalities.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit higher surface areas, more accessible active sites, and better thermal and mechanical stability. These properties contribute to improved reaction efficiency, selectivity, and overall performance in PDH reactions.

1. 层级沸石通过提供更大的催化剂和反应物表面，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可访问性。这种结构允许反应物更好地扩散到沸石中，并且有效去除产物，从而提高反应动力学和选择性。

2. 层级沸石的主要类型包括有序介孔材料（OMMs）和金属有机框架（MOFs）。这些材料通过模板导向自组装、聚合和配位化学等方法合成。这些材料通过提供精确的孔尺寸和形状以及可定制的表面功能，来改善PDH反应性能。

3. 相比传统沸石，层级沸石通常具有更高的表面积、更可及的活性位点和更好的热力学和机械稳定性。这些特性有助于提高反应效率、选择性和整体PDH反应性能。
