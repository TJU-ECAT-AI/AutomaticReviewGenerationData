[1] "A one-dimensional (1D) plug flow reactor (PFR) model was developed for simulating the PBMR and PBR."
[2] "Silicalite membrane showed a moderate separation performance for H2/propane, but using the membrane considerably helped in enhancing PDH reaction performance for PBMR."
[3] "The highest propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield obtained were 49, 97, and 47%, respectively, at 600 C, 1.1 h1, FAr = 20 cm3/min, and pressure = 5 atm."
[4] "H2 recovery (RH2) increased with increasing pressure as more H2 was transferred to the permeate side, but permeate side H2 concentration (yH2,p) reduced with an increase in pressure because propane and unreacted propylene also diffuse across the membrane, which reduced the concentration of H2 in the permeate side."
[5] "Increasing reaction pressure reduced the methane selectivity for both PBMR and PBR."

The hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for catalysts and reactants. They improve performance by allowing more efficient diffusion of reactants and products, reducing resistance, and increasing contact time. Main types include silicalite, SAPO-34, and others, synthesized using methods such as the secondary growth method and sol-gel processes. These materials improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better separation efficiency, faster reaction kinetics, and higher yields of propylene with lower methane and other byproduct formation.

层级型沸石，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的表面积来增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过允许更有效的反应物和产物扩散、减少阻力和增加接触时间来提高性能。主要类型包括硅酸盐、SAPO-34等，使用方法如二次生长法和溶胶-凝胶过程合成。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供更高的分离效率、更快的反应动力学和更高的丙烯产率以及较低的甲烷和其他副产品形成，改善了PDH反应。
