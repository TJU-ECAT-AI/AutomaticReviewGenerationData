The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. They achieve this by having a structured pore system that includes both micropores for adsorption and mesopores/macropores for diffusion. The main types of these materials are typically classified as MFI, MEL, and MOR zeolites, among others. They are synthesized using various methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, ion exchange, and sol-gel processes. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by allowing for more efficient diffusion of reactants and products, which leads to faster reaction kinetics and higher yield of propylene. The encapsulated CoO clusters within the silicalite-1 zeolite act as active sites for PDH reactions, offering better stability and selectivity due to their unique structure that prevents over-dehydrogenation and enhances propylene formation.

1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve access for PDH reactions. They are primarily classified into two types: mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites are created using template-directed methods, whereas macroporous zeolites are made through sacrificial templating techniques. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites enhance PDH reaction efficiency thanks to their superior pore structures.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products. They allow for better diffusion of gases, facilitating more efficient adsorption and desorption processes. The main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized through methods such as template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and microwave-assisted synthesis. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites due to enhanced reactivity and stability.

2. The CoO@S-1 catalyst, which contains encapsulated subnanometric cobalt oxide clusters within silicalite-1 zeolites, demonstrates high efficiency in PDH reactions. It achieves a propylene formation rate of 13.66mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 with a selectivity greater than 92%. This catalyst is durable, maintaining its performance over 120 hours of continuous operation with five regeneration cycles. The high activity is attributed to the encapsulated CoO clusters, which effectively adsorb propane and stabilize detached hydrogen species, resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework cobalt(II) cations and cobalt(III) nanoparticles. Moreover, the π-binding mode of propylene on the CoO clusters prevents over-dehydrogenation, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability.

1. 层级沸石通过提供更大的表面积和更多的反应路径，结合微孔、介孔和大孔，从而增强PDH反应过程的可及性。主要类型包括介孔和大孔沸石，可通过模板导向合成、溶胶-凝胶过程和微波辅助合成等方法制备。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提高反应性和稳定性来提升PDH反应性能。

2. 含有封装在硅铝酸盐-1沸石内的亚纳米钴氧化物簇的CoO@S-1催化剂，在PDH反应中表现出高效率。它实现了13.66mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1的丙烯生成速率，选择性超过92%。此催化剂在连续运行120小时并完成五次再生循环后仍保持其性能。高活性归因于封装的钴氧化物簇，它们有效地吸附丙烷并稳定脱氢的氢物种，导致比框架钴（II）离子和钴（III）纳米颗粒更低的脱氢壁垒。此外，钴氧化物簇上的丙烯π结合模式防止过脱氢，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。
