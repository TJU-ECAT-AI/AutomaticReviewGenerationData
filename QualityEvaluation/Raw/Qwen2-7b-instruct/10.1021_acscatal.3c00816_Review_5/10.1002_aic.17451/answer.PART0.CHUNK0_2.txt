[1] "In situ encapsulated subnanometric CoO clusters within silicalite-1 zeolites (CoO@S-1) has been obtained via a ligand assistance in situ crystallization method."
[2] "This CoO@S-1 catalyst exhibits an attractive propylene formation rate of 13.66mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 with selectivity of >92% and is durable during 120-h PDH reaction with five successive regeneration cycles."
[3] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[4] "Additionally, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction compared with the di-σ binding propylene on metallic Co, leading to the superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. They achieve this by having a structured pore system that includes both micropores for adsorption and mesopores/macropores for diffusion. The main types of these materials are typically classified as MFI, MEL, and MOR zeolites, among others. They are synthesized using various methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, ion exchange, and sol-gel processes. Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by allowing for more efficient diffusion of reactants and products, which leads to faster reaction kinetics and higher yield of propylene. The encapsulated CoO clusters within the silicalite-1 zeolite act as active sites for PDH reactions, offering better stability and selectivity due to their unique structure that prevents over-dehydrogenation and enhances propylene formation.
