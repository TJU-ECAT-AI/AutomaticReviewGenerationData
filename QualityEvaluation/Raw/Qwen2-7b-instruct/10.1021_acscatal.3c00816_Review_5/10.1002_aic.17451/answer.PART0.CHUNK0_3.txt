1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve access for PDH reactions. They are primarily classified into two types: mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites are created using template-directed methods, whereas macroporous zeolites are made through sacrificial templating techniques. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites enhance PDH reaction efficiency thanks to their superior pore structures.

1. 级联沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们主要分为两类：介孔沸石和大孔沸石。介孔沸石是通过模板导向方法制备的，而大孔沸石则是通过牺牲模板技术制备的。与传统沸石相比，级联沸石通过其更优越的孔结构提高了PDH反应的效率。
