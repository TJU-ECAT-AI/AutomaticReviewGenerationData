Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve access for PDH reactions. They are fabricated using methods such as sol-gel, template-directed synthesis, and microwave-assisted synthesis. These materials surpass traditional zeolites in terms of reagent and product accessibility, thus enhancing PDH reaction efficiency.
