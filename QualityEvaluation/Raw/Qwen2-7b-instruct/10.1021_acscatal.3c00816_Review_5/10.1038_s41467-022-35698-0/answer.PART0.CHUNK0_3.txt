[1] "In the vast majority of catalytic processes, the interaction between support and active metal site is of great importance in determining their catalytic performance."
[2] "In silica-supported metal catalysts, surface hydroxyl plays a vital part in regulating the dispersion of the introduced metal sites."
[3] "The as-synthesized catalyst is attempted to the propane dehydrogenation, which shows better reactivity when compared with other reported Co based catalysts."
