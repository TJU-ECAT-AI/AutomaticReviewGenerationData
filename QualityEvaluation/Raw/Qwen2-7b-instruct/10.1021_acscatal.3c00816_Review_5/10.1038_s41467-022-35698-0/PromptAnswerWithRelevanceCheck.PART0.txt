[1] "In the vast majority of catalytic processes, the interaction between support and active metal site is of great importance in determining their catalytic performance2."
[2] "Hydroxyl groups on the surface of these supports are therewith emphasized as the bridge to build required interaction between metal and support, which is beneficial to acquiring highly dispersed and stable metal sites on the supports11,12."
[3] "However, the special role of adsorbed water derived by hydroxyl groups on the silica is generally ignored."
[4] "It is indicated that sufficient adsorbed water induces the transformation of precursor of Co(NO3)2 into intermediate of [Co(H2O)6]2+."
[5] "The as-synthesized catalyst is attempted to the propane dehydrogenation, which shows better reactivity when compared with other reported Co based catalysts."
[6] "In-situ FT-IR spectra of a Dir-reduction, b Dir-reduction (PM), c Dir-reduction (IMP900), d Dir-reduction (PM900) during H2-direct reduction process; In-situ NH3-DRIFS of e SBA-15 and f Dir-reduction catalyst in the heating process."
[7] "The catalyst was orderly treated by the impregnation and drying processes, then Co was existed in the form of [Co(H2O)6]2+(the coordination number and bond distance were calculated from XANES data)."
[8] "DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the importance of the intermediate of hydrated cobalt species."
[9] "It is evidenced that the cobalt was in the form of [Co(H2O)6]2+ over Dir-reduction and Dir-reduction(PM) catalysts, which contained abundant absorbed water."
[10] "Catalysts characterization, which includes powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), quasi in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 1H NMR, in situ NH3-DRIFTS, in situ FT-IR and DFT computation were given in the Supporting Information (SI)."
[11] "The conversion of C3H8 and selectivity of C3H6 were calculated as follows:$${{{{{\rm{C}}}}}}_{3}{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}_{8}{{{{\rm{conversion}}}}}(\%)=\frac{{C}_{3}{H}_{8in}-{C}_{3}{H}_{8out}}{{C}_{3}{H}_{8in}}\times 100$$ (1)"
[12] "Whereas, this part of absorbed water was existed in the form of [Co(H2O)6]2+."
[13] "It is precisely because the presence of absorbed water which was in favor of the formation of [Co(H2O)6]2+ made Co species easier to be transferred into Td-Co(II)."
[14] "The dehydroxylation process of Co/SiO2 was compared to that of SiO2 (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 19)."
[15] "In contrast, the peak of adsorbed water at 1630cm1 also disappeared gradually with the increase of temperature50, indicating the consumption and transformation of adsorbed water."
[16] "The above results indicated that cobalt nitrate can be converted into [Co(H2O)6]2+ in the presence of adsorbed water."
[17] "When adsorbed water was absent, there was no way to obtain highly dispersed Td-Co(II)."
[18] "The presence of [Co(H2O)6]2+ reduced the free energy of dehydroxylation process over the silica support of SBA-15."
[19] "The structure of Td-Co(II) remained intact during the reaction."
[20] "The obtained Co/SBA-15 catalyst from direct H2-reduction process displayed better reactivity than the reported cobalt-based catalysts toward PDH reaction."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing larger surface areas and more pathways for reactants and products. Main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, synthesized through methods like sol-gel, template-assisted synthesis, and post-synthesis modification. These materials improve PDH reactions by facilitating faster diffusion of reactants, better utilization of active sites, and enhanced stability.

2. Adsorbed water derived from hydroxyl groups on the silica surface plays a crucial role in inducing the formation of highly dispersed tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites, which are beneficial for PDH reactions.

3. The presence of adsorbed water allows for the transformation of precursor cobalt nitrate into an intermediate of [Co(H2O)6]2+, leading to the formation of highly dispersed tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites.

4. The as-synthesized catalyst, incorporating adsorbed water-induced tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites, demonstrates superior performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to other cobalt-based catalysts.

5. The catalytic activity of the obtained Co/SBA-15 catalyst is significantly enhanced by the presence of adsorbed water, which promotes the formation of tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites, thereby improving the efficiency of the PDH reaction.

6. The hierarchical zeolite catalysts show improved accessibility for PDH reactions due to their unique pore structures, allowing for better control of reactant diffusion and product release, ultimately enhancing the catalytic performance.

7. The use of adsorbed water as a key component in the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites enables the creation of highly dispersed tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites, which are crucial for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

8. DFT calculations confirm the importance of the intermediate [Co(H2O)6]2+ in the formation of tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites, highlighting its role in reducing the free energy of dehydroxylation over the silica support.

9. The catalyst's structure remains intact during the PDH reaction, indicating its stability and effectiveness in maintaining the tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites.

10. The catalyst derived from direct H2-reduction shows better reactivity in propane dehydrogenation compared to reported cobalt-based catalysts, emphasizing the significance of adsorbed water in achieving high-reactivity tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites.

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants and products. These materials are mainly categorized into two types: mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites, such as MCM-41, are synthesized through the template-directed self-assembly of organic frameworks followed by acid treatment to remove the templates. Macroporous zeolites, like SBA-15, are typically produced by templating with surfactants and followed by a calcination step to remove the template. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer enhanced stability, improved selectivity, and higher activity due to their optimized pore structures and larger surface areas.
