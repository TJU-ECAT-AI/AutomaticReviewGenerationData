[1] "In the vast majority of catalytic processes, the interaction between support and active metal site is of great importance in determining their catalytic performance2."
[2] "Hydroxyl groups on the surface of these supports are therewith emphasized as the bridge to build required interaction between metal and support, which is beneficial to acquiring highly dispersed and stable metal sites on the supports11,12."
[3] "However, the special role of adsorbed water derived by hydroxyl groups on the silica is generally ignored."
[4] "It is indicated that sufficient adsorbed water induces the transformation of precursor of Co(NO3)2 into intermediate of [Co(H2O)6]2+."
[5] "The as-synthesized catalyst is attempted to the propane dehydrogenation, which shows better reactivity when compared with other reported Co based catalysts."
[6] "In-situ FT-IR spectra of a Dir-reduction, b Dir-reduction (PM), c Dir-reduction (IMP900), d Dir-reduction (PM900) during H2-direct reduction process; In-situ NH3-DRIFS of e SBA-15 and f Dir-reduction catalyst in the heating process."
[7] "The catalyst was orderly treated by the impregnation and drying processes, then Co was existed in the form of [Co(H2O)6]2+(the coordination number and bond distance were calculated from XANES data)."
[8] "DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the importance of the intermediate of hydrated cobalt species."
[9] "It is evidenced that the cobalt was in the form of [Co(H2O)6]2+ over Dir-reduction and Dir-reduction(PM) catalysts, which contained abundant absorbed water."
[10] "Catalysts characterization, which includes powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), quasi in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 1H NMR, in situ NH3-DRIFTS, in situ FT-IR and DFT computation were given in the Supporting Information (SI)."
[11] "The conversion of C3H8 and selectivity of C3H6 were calculated as follows:$${{{{{\rm{C}}}}}}_{3}{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}_{8}{{{{\rm{conversion}}}}}(\%)=\frac{{C}_{3}{H}_{8in}-{C}_{3}{H}_{8out}}{{C}_{3}{H}_{8in}}\times 100$$ (1)"
[12] "Whereas, this part of absorbed water was existed in the form of [Co(H2O)6]2+."
[13] "It is precisely because the presence of absorbed water which was in favor of the formation of [Co(H2O)6]2+ made Co species easier to be transferred into Td-Co(II)."
[14] "The dehydroxylation process of Co/SiO2 was compared to that of SiO2 (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 19)."
[15] "In contrast, the peak of adsorbed water at 1630cm1 also disappeared gradually with the increase of temperature50, indicating the consumption and transformation of adsorbed water."
[16] "The above results indicated that cobalt nitrate can be converted into [Co(H2O)6]2+ in the presence of adsorbed water."
[17] "When adsorbed water was absent, there was no way to obtain highly dispersed Td-Co(II)."
[18] "The presence of [Co(H2O)6]2+ reduced the free energy of dehydroxylation process over the silica support of SBA-15."
[19] "The structure of Td-Co(II) remained intact during the reaction."
[20] "The obtained Co/SBA-15 catalyst from direct H2-reduction process displayed better reactivity than the reported cobalt-based catalysts toward PDH reaction."
