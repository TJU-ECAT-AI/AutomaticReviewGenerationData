The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants and products. These materials are mainly categorized into two types: mesoporous and macroporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites, such as MCM-41, are synthesized through the template-directed self-assembly of organic frameworks followed by acid treatment to remove the templates. Macroporous zeolites, like SBA-15, are typically produced by templating with surfactants and followed by a calcination step to remove the template. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer enhanced stability, improved selectivity, and higher activity due to their optimized pore structures and larger surface areas.

层级沸石通过提供更大的表面积和更易于到达的反应物和产物位点，结合了微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性。这些材料主要分为两类：介孔沸石和大孔沸石。介孔沸石，如MCM-41，通过有机框架的模板导向自组装合成，随后通过酸处理去除模板。大孔沸石，如SBA-15，则通常通过表面活性剂模板化制备，并在脱模步骤后进行煅烧。与传统沸石相比，层级沸石因其优化的孔结构和更大的表面积，提供了增强的稳定性、改进的选择性和更高的活性。
