[1] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1."
[2] "The synthesis gel compositions and the representative porous textural properties of the zeolites (i.e., Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, micropore volume, and mesoporous volume) are summarized in Table 1."
[3] "The XRD patterns in the small-angle region ( Fig. 1 a, left) exhibited a shoulder peak at around 2θ = 1.5 (d = 5.9 nm). This shoulder peak is interpreted to originate from the spacing between the two neighboring pore walls in the mesoporous zeolite."
[4] "There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."
[5] "The four samples commonly exhibited an intense absorption peak at 3,740 cm1. This peak corresponds to the isolated silanol groups, which are not associated with hydrogen (H) bonding."
[6] "In the case of MZ-sc, the isolated silanol was found to be the main form of the zeolite silanols, and the presence of the silanol nest was almost negligible."
[7] "In MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites, all the spectra showed the Brnsted acid (i.e., silanol nests) signal with moderately high intensity."
[8] "This result is notable in that the formation of Pt3Y nanoparticles can simply be achieved without post-synthetic degallation of a gallosilicate zeolite."
[9] "These two catalysts did not contain any Ga, the increased catalytic lifetime is not attributable to the Ga effect."
[10] "Furthermore, to confirm the effect of silanol nests, the PDH reaction was measured with PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl, where the zeolite support was synthesized by simply adding a small amount of NaCl into the synthesis gel composition for MZ-sf-Br."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction, faster diffusion paths for reactants and products, and better separation of reaction intermediates. The main types of these materials include mesoporous MFI zeolites with ultrathin nanosheet frameworks. These materials are synthesized under sodium-free conditions using a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite improves the performance of PDH reactions by facilitating the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials show enhanced stability and activity in PDH reactions.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a structure that allows for both small molecule diffusion and larger molecule accommodation. This structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by facilitating better access to the active sites and potentially reducing the risk of coking.

2. The main types and synthesis methods of these materials involve using a C1864 surfactant-type structure-directing agent. This agent helps in the formation of the desired hierarchical structure during the synthesis process.

3. The siliceous MFI zeolites with a mesopore/micropore hierarchy prepared under sodium-free conditions enhance PDH catalytic performance by providing a support for PtY alloy nanoparticles. The presence of silanol nests in these zeolites plays a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, leading to improved catalytic properties.

4. The PtY alloy nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the support material, which is crucial for their effective catalytic activity in PDH reactions.

5. The silanol nests generated during the direct synthesis in MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br zeolites are essential for the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. These nanoparticles exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior, which is indicative of a distinct change in the electronic state of Pt upon intermetallic compound formation.

6. The three PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites require an activation period of 12 hours to reach full conversion. This activation is often attributed to the rearrangement of the metal surface structure under the reaction conditions.

[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers [1] ."
[2] "However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas [2] ."
[3] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance [3] , causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes [4] ."
[4] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene [5] ,[6] ."
[5] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit [5] ."
[6] "Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition [5] ."
[7] "Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process [7] ."
[8] "On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d) [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] , but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl [12] ."
[9] "To resolve the deactivation problem due to coke deposition [13] ,[14] , other metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, and In) have also been investigated as substitutes for Sn in recent years [15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ."
[10] "These investigations suggested that the use of new alloy nanoparticles with an intermetallic compound-type structure might be a suitable strategy to resolve the rapid deactivation problem [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ."
[11] "Among the intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, we focus on a recent work by Ryoo et al. on Pt3Y and Pt3La nanoparticles supported on a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite [28] ."
[12] "The mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y and Pt3La catalysts exhibited very slow deactivation in the PDH reaction and high propylene selectivity."
[13] "The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 or La(NO3)3, followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2."
[14] "This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt [31] ."
[15] "To form an alloy with Pt, the rare earth element (REE) oxides should be fully reduced to the metallic zero-oxidation state."
[16] "However, such a transition to the fully reduced metallic state is generally difficult to achieve by H2 in the case of the Y and La elements [32] , since the reduction of REEs requires an exceedingly high chemical potential energy."
[17] "Instead, the supported REEs are rather known for causing strong metal-support interactions in a non-metallic oxide state [35] ."
[18] "Ryoo et al. circumvented the reduction-potential problem by atomically dispersing the REEs on silanol nests in a surfactant-templated mesoporous zeolite [28] ."
[19] "The silanol nest refers to a cluster of neighboring -SiOH groups that are associated with hydrogen bonding [36] ,[37] ."
[20] "Upon O2 calcination, the silanol nest was able to disperse the REE into a single atomic species by coordination bonding."
[21] "The single atomically dispersed REE species could readily be converted to the metallic state by H2."
[22] "The aim of the present work was to clarify the effect of the Pt3Y alloy formation for PDH catalytic performance, using a purely siliceous zeolite possessing silanol nests."
[23] "After various attempts, we found that a mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests can be directly synthesized in a silica form under an alkali-free condition using a diammonium hydroxide surfactant."
[24] "Further, we simplified the synthesis procedure to the use of a bromide surfactant, C1864Br2, and N(CH3)4OH."
[25] "The synthesis results and the PDH application results are reported in this paper."

[17] "All four zeolites exhibited similar Bragg reflections in the wide-angle region (i.e., 2θ > 5) of the XRD patterns ( Fig. 1 a, left)."
[18] "The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1 b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification [45] ."
[19] "The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 31003900 cm1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols [47] ,[48] ,[49] ."
[20] "In the case of MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites, all the spectra showed the Brnsted acid (i.e., silanol nests) signal with moderately high intensity."
[21] "The formation of tiny metal nanoparticles can be attributed to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores in MZ [54] ."
[22] "Moreover, the average atomic ratio of Pt to Y was determined to be approximately 3 for both PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br samples, which agrees well with the Pt/Y ratio of Pt3Y intermetallic alloys supported on MZ-dg in a previous study [28] ."
[23] "In this regard, hydrogen chemisorption properties of PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br were examined to indirectly assess the degree of intermetallic alloy formation assisted by silanol nests generated by direct synthesis."
[24] "The results suggest that the silanol nests generated by the direct synthesis in MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br have a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles that exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior upon changes in the electronic state of Pt."
[25] "Unlike the defect-less zeolite supported catalyst, all of the PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on the group of defect-containing zeolites [i.e., PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br, PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH, and PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg] exhibited a dramatic improvement in the catalytic lifetime due to the Y addition (i.e., the effect of Pt-Y alloy formation)."
[26] "Furthermore, we performed coke analysis with the PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst sample recovered after measurement for 21 d. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst showed that 37 wt% of coke species were deposited on the catalyst sample (Fig. S10)."
[27] "The results show that there is an inverse relationship between the propane conversion and the metal loading amount when the catalysts were fully activated."
[28] "On the contrary, when the metal loading was decreased to 0.50 and 0.25 wt%, the catalyst durability rather decreased."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level structure that increases the surface area for reactant adsorption and improves the diffusion pathways for molecules. The main types of these materials include mesoporous MFI zeolites with a hierarchical structure of micropores and mesopores. The synthesis methods involve using a diammonium hydroxide surfactant under alkali-free conditions, which facilitates the spontaneous generation of silanol nests in the zeolite framework. These silanol nests play a crucial role in promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability and performance in PDH reactions.

2. The synthesis of these hierarchical zeolites under sodium-free conditions leads to the formation of silanol nests, which are clusters of neighboring -SiOH groups associated with hydrogen bonding. These nests allow for the dispersion of rare earth elements like yttrium into single atomic species, facilitating their conversion to the metallic state during the PDH reaction. The presence of silanol nests enhances the catalytic performance of the Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles by improving their stability and activity.

3. The hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering a higher surface area for adsorption, better control over metal dispersion, and enhanced resistance to coke deposition. The silanol nests specifically contribute to the stability of the Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles, leading to improved catalytic activity and prolonged catalytic lifetime. This results in higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions.

4. The key benefits of using these hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions include the ability to form stable intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, the enhanced catalytic activity due to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores, and the improved stability against coke formation. The synthesis strategy also allows for the simplification of the PDH process, potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective methods for propylene production.
