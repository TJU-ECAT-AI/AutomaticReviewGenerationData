[1] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1."
[2] "The synthesis gel compositions and the representative porous textural properties of the zeolites (i.e., Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, micropore volume, and mesoporous volume) are summarized in Table 1."
[3] "The XRD patterns in the small-angle region ( Fig. 1 a, left) exhibited a shoulder peak at around 2θ = 1.5 (d = 5.9 nm). This shoulder peak is interpreted to originate from the spacing between the two neighboring pore walls in the mesoporous zeolite."
[4] "There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."
[5] "The four samples commonly exhibited an intense absorption peak at 3,740 cm1. This peak corresponds to the isolated silanol groups, which are not associated with hydrogen (H) bonding."
[6] "In the case of MZ-sc, the isolated silanol was found to be the main form of the zeolite silanols, and the presence of the silanol nest was almost negligible."
[7] "In MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites, all the spectra showed the Brnsted acid (i.e., silanol nests) signal with moderately high intensity."
[8] "This result is notable in that the formation of Pt3Y nanoparticles can simply be achieved without post-synthetic degallation of a gallosilicate zeolite."
[9] "These two catalysts did not contain any Ga, the increased catalytic lifetime is not attributable to the Ga effect."
[10] "Furthermore, to confirm the effect of silanol nests, the PDH reaction was measured with PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl, where the zeolite support was synthesized by simply adding a small amount of NaCl into the synthesis gel composition for MZ-sf-Br."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction, faster diffusion paths for reactants and products, and better separation of reaction intermediates. The main types of these materials include mesoporous MFI zeolites with ultrathin nanosheet frameworks. These materials are synthesized under sodium-free conditions using a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite improves the performance of PDH reactions by facilitating the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials show enhanced stability and activity in PDH reactions.
