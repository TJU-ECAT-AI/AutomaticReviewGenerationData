[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers [1] ."
[2] "However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas [2] ."
[3] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance [3] , causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes [4] ."
[4] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene [5] ,[6] ."
[5] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit [5] ."
[6] "Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition [5] ."
[7] "Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process [7] ."
[8] "On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d) [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] , but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl [12] ."
[9] "To resolve the deactivation problem due to coke deposition [13] ,[14] , other metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, and In) have also been investigated as substitutes for Sn in recent years [15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ."
[10] "These investigations suggested that the use of new alloy nanoparticles with an intermetallic compound-type structure might be a suitable strategy to resolve the rapid deactivation problem [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ."
[11] "Among the intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, we focus on a recent work by Ryoo et al. on Pt3Y and Pt3La nanoparticles supported on a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite [28] ."
[12] "The mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y and Pt3La catalysts exhibited very slow deactivation in the PDH reaction and high propylene selectivity."
[13] "The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 or La(NO3)3, followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2."
[14] "This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt [31] ."
[15] "To form an alloy with Pt, the rare earth element (REE) oxides should be fully reduced to the metallic zero-oxidation state."
[16] "However, such a transition to the fully reduced metallic state is generally difficult to achieve by H2 in the case of the Y and La elements [32] , since the reduction of REEs requires an exceedingly high chemical potential energy."
[17] "Instead, the supported REEs are rather known for causing strong metal-support interactions in a non-metallic oxide state [35] ."
[18] "Ryoo et al. circumvented the reduction-potential problem by atomically dispersing the REEs on silanol nests in a surfactant-templated mesoporous zeolite [28] ."
[19] "The silanol nest refers to a cluster of neighboring -SiOH groups that are associated with hydrogen bonding [36] ,[37] ."
[20] "Upon O2 calcination, the silanol nest was able to disperse the REE into a single atomic species by coordination bonding."
[21] "The single atomically dispersed REE species could readily be converted to the metallic state by H2."
[22] "The aim of the present work was to clarify the effect of the Pt3Y alloy formation for PDH catalytic performance, using a purely siliceous zeolite possessing silanol nests."
[23] "After various attempts, we found that a mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests can be directly synthesized in a silica form under an alkali-free condition using a diammonium hydroxide surfactant."
[24] "Further, we simplified the synthesis procedure to the use of a bromide surfactant, C1864Br2, and N(CH3)4OH."
[25] "The synthesis results and the PDH application results are reported in this paper."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a multi-level pore structure that facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized through hydrothermal treatments under controlled conditions. The synthesis methods involve the use of surfactants and template agents to control the pore size and shape. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better thermal stability, increased surface area, and improved pore accessibility, which leads to higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
