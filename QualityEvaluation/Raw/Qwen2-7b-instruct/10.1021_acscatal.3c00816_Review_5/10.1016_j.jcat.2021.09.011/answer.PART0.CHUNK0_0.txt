[1] "Four samples of siliceous MFI zeolite with a mesopore/micropore hierarchy were prepared according to modified synthesis procedures."
[2] "These hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[3] "The main types of these materials include mesoporous MFI zeolites, which have a crystalline framework structure with irregular nanosponge-like morphologies."
[4] "Synthesis methods involve using a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source."
[5] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."
[6] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
[7] "Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improved PDH reaction performance by allowing better access for reactants and products."
