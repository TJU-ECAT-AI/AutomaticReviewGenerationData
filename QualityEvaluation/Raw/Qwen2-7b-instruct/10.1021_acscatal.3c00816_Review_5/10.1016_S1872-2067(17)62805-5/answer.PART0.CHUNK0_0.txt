1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 
2. These materials are generally synthesized through a blend of sol-gel techniques and template-directed assembly.
3. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites feature enhanced surface areas and more open pore architectures, which can result in greater catalytic effectiveness for PDH reactions.
