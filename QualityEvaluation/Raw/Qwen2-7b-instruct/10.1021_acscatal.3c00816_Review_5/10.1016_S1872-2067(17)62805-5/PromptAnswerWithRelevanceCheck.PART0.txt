<quotes>
[1] "Sn-incorporated SBA-15 mesoporous materials with high specific surface areas were prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis."
[2] "These materials gave excellent catalytic performance and good resistance to coking in propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 matrix led to strong interactions between Sn species and the support, and these helped to maintain the oxidation states of Sn species during the reaction."
[4] "The catalytic activities and stabilities of the Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 were better than those of the impregnated sample."
[5] "However, the catalytic performance deteriorated when an excessive amount of Sn was introduced and the interactions among Pt, Sn species, and the support became weaker."
[6] "The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst gave the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%."
</quotes>

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface area and large pore size. This allows for easier diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include SBA-15, which is synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method. This method prevents pore clogging and achieves a good distribution of Sn species within the silica matrix, leading to enhanced promotion efficiency compared to traditional impregnation methods. Incorporating Sn into the zeolite structure creates strong interactions with the support, maintaining the oxidation state of Sn species and improving the stability of the catalyst. The Pt catalyst supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 materials showed superior performance in PDH reactions, achieving high propene selectivity and stability. Excessive Sn content, however, can weaken the interactions among Pt, Sn species, and the support, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

这些材料通过一锅法水热合成制备，具有高比表面积和高度有序的介孔结构。这种组合提供了高表面面积和大孔径，从而增强了PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括SBA-15，其合成方法是通过一锅法水热合成。这种方法可以防止孔隙堵塞，并在二氧化硅骨架中实现Sn物种的良好分布，从而提高与传统浸渍方法相比的促进效率。将Sn引入到沸石结构中，会与支撑物产生强烈的相互作用，维持Sn物种的氧化状态，并改善催化剂的稳定性。在Sn掺杂SBA-15材料上负载的Pt催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优越性能，实现了高的丙烯选择性和稳定性。然而，过量的Sn含量会使Pt、Sn物种和支持之间的相互作用变弱，导致催化活性下降。
