[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites are ordered mesoporous materials like SBA-15."
[3] "These materials are synthesized through a facile one-pot hydrothermal method."
[4] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer larger surface areas and well-distributed pore sizes, improving metal dispersion and stability."
[5] "The improved performance of PDH reactions is due to enhanced metal dispersion and stability, better interaction between metals and supports, and reduced coke formation."
