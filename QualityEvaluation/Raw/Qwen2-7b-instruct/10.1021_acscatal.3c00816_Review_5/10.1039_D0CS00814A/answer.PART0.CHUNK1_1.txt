1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions. Typical examples include SBA-15, MCM-41, and MCM-48. These materials are synthesized through various methods such as the Stöber process, sol-gel technique, and template-directed synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH performance by offering a larger accessible surface area and enhanced pore connectivity. The superior pore structure facilitates better distribution of reactants and products, reducing resistance to mass transfer and enhancing catalytic activity.
