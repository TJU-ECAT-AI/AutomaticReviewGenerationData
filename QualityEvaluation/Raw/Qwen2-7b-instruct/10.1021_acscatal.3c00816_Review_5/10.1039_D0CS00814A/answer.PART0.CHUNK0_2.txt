Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction to occur, along with easier diffusion paths for reactants and products. These materials typically consist of a core of microporous zeolites encapsulated within a shell of mesoporous or macroporous material. The synthesis methods often involve the use of templating agents to create the hierarchical structure, followed by calcination to remove the templates. The combination of these pores improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by increasing the reaction rate and selectivity.

For example, the micropores allow for efficient adsorption of the reactant propane, while the mesopores or macropores facilitate the diffusion of the reactant to the active sites and the diffusion of products away from the active sites, reducing the risk of product inhibition. This hierarchical structure also enables better control over the pore size distribution, which can be tailored to optimize the reaction conditions for PDH.

In particular, the support acidity plays a critical role in the performance of PDH reactions. To prevent undesirable coke and alkane isomerization, the acidity of the support should be carefully controlled. Alkaline metals like lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) can help poison the strong acid sites on the support, thereby avoiding coke deposition on the surface of the support.

Additionally, materials like ceria (CeO2) have redox properties that can be utilized to eliminate coke deposition during the propane dehydrogenation process. The strong interactions between ceria and metal particles, leading to trapping of Pt atoms in the form of Pt ions, can also contribute to the stability and performance of the catalyst.

Furthermore, the amount of coordinatively unsaturated penta-coordinate aluminum (Al) atoms on the surface of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) can greatly impact the catalytic properties of the material. High amounts of these Al atoms can enhance the stability and activity of the catalyst. The strong interactions between ceria and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions, can also contribute to the stability and performance of the catalyst.

Regarding gallium (Ga), the active sites are debated and influenced by the type of support, preparation method, and loading amount. The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) indicates that the activation of propane occurs through the loss of one hydrogen to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, followed by the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group. The energy barrier for the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3, indicating that the stability of the active sites is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH reaction.

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的反应表面以及反应物和产物更容易扩散的路径来增强PDH反应的可达性。这些材料通常由包含在壳层中的微孔沸石核心组成。合成方法通常涉及使用模板剂创建层级结构，随后通过煅烧去除模板。这种多孔结构的组合可以提高PDH反应性能，通过增加反应速率和选择性。

例如，微孔允许有效吸附反应物丙烷，而介孔或大孔则有利于反应物到达活性位点并从活性位点扩散出产物，从而降低产物抑制的风险。这种层级结构还允许更好地控制孔径大小分布，这可以根据优化PDH条件进行调整。

特别是在支持酸性方面，它对PDH反应性能起着关键作用。为了防止不希望的焦炭和烷烃异构化，应仔细控制支持的酸性。如锂（Li）、钠（Na）和钾（K）等碱金属可以帮助毒化支持上的强酸位点，从而避免焦炭沉积在支持表面上。

此外，铈氧化物（CeO2）具有还原性性质，可以在PDH过程中消除焦炭沉积。与金属颗粒之间的强烈相互作用，导致铂原子以铂离子形式被捕获，也可以促进催化剂的稳定性和性能。

另外，铝（Al）原子表面的五配位铝（Al）原子的数量可以极大地影响材料的催化性能。高数量的这些Al原子可以增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。与铈之间的强烈相互作用，其中铂原子可以被捕获形成铂离子，也可以贡献于催化剂的稳定性和性能。

关于镓（Ga），活性位点存在争议，并且受到支撑类型、制备方法和负载量的影响。DFT计算显示，丙烷在Ga2O3(100)表面的激活首先通过失去一个氢原子形成一个丙基组和一个羟基组，然后通过去除β-H形成另一个羟基组。脱附步骤中吸附氢原子的能量壁垒限制了Ga2O3的活性，表明活性位点的稳定性对于PDH反应效率至关重要。
