[1] "Among them, a PtSn bimetallic catalyst shows good selectivity and stability, and has received the most extensive attention."
[2] "Comparatively, in region D, lower propylene formation rates and higher deactivation rates are obtained."
[3] "However, numerous V species exist on VOx-based catalysts, including V5+, V4+, V3+, isolated V, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5. Which V species are responsible for propane activation and selective propylene production is still unclear."
[4] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned."

1. A PtSn bimetallic catalyst has been noted for its excellent selectivity and stability, garnering the most attention among catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
2. In the performance analysis, region D indicates lower propylene formation rates alongside higher deactivation rates.
3. The exact V species responsible for propane activation and the selective production of propylene on vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains uncertain due to the presence of multiple vanadium species (V5+, V4+, V3+, isolated V, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5).
4. Altering the particle size and crystalline phase of zirconia can significantly adjust the concentration of Zrcus cations, which plays a role in the dehydrogenation process.

1. PtSn双金属催化剂因其出色的选择性和稳定性，获得了对丙烷脱氢反应最广泛的注意。
2. 在性能评估中，区域D显示了较低的丙烯形成速率和更高的失活率。
3. 由于存在多种钒物种（V5+、V4+、V3+、孤立的V、寡聚的Vn+和结晶V2O5），对于丙烷激活和选择性丙烯生成的钒物种具体是哪一种仍然不清楚。
4. 改变锆石的粒径和晶相可以显著调整Zrcus离子的浓度，这在脱氢过程中起作用。
