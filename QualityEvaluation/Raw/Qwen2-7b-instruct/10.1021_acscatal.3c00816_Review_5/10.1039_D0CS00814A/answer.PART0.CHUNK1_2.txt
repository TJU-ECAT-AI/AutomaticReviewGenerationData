1. The complex structures and pretreatment of metal oxides make it hard to figure out the active sites for PDH reactions, especially under reaction conditions.  
2. The activity of GaOx-based catalysts for PDH relies heavily on the structure of Ga species.
3. The CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers vary among VOx-based catalysts due to their different VO bonds.
4. Unsaturated and/or clustered Cr3+ sites are typically recognized as the active sites for CrOx-based catalysts in PDH reactions.
5. Coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations (Zrcus) are the active sites for ZrO2-based catalysts that exhibit PDH activity and selectivity.
