[1] "The complex structures and pretreatment of metal oxides make it difficult to reveal the nature of the active sites, especially under the reaction conditions."
[2] "Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites."

Hierarchical zeolites, which combine micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for active sites and allowing better diffusion of reactants and products. The main types include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and hybrid zeolites that combine both microporous and mesoporous features. Synthesis methods involve template-directed synthesis, such as the SBA-15 method, which allows precise control over pore size and shape. These materials improve PDH reactions by offering higher surface areas and pore volumes, which can lead to faster reaction kinetics and better selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.

分级沸石，通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的活性位点表面积以及反应物和产物更好的扩散路径来增强PDH反应的可接近性。主要类型包括介孔沸石、大孔沸石以及结合微孔与介孔特性的混合沸石。合成方法包括模板导向合成，如SBA-15方法，这允许对孔径大小和形状进行精确控制。这些材料通过提供更高的比表面积和孔体积来改进PDH反应，这可能导致更快的反应动力学和更好的选择性，与传统沸石相比。
