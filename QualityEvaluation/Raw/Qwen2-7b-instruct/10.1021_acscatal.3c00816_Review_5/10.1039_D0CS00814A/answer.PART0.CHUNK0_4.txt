1. Hierarchical zeolites, such as Ga-MFI catalyst #6 with a Si/Ga ratio of 140, incorporate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. This catalyst achieves a conversion of 55% and a selectivity of 70-90% at 600°C with a weight to flow (W/F) ratio of 0.3. It has a deactivation rate constant of 0.0025e. 

2. Improving the performance of PDH reactions through hierarchical zeolites involves increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites by doping the material. This strategy enhances the activity of GaOx-based catalysts.

3. Tuning the particle size and crystalline phase of hierarchical zeolites allows for a significant adjustment in the concentration of Zrcus cations. This adjustment facilitates the generation of Zrcus cations through doping and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere, thereby enhancing PDH reaction performance.

1. 层状沸石，如具有Si/Ga比为140的Ga-MFI催化剂#6，通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强丙烷脱氢反应的可接近性。该催化剂在600°C下以重量流速（W/F）比为0.3时，实现了55%的转化率和70%-90%的选择性。其失活速率常数为0.0025e。

2. 提高PDH反应性能通过层状沸石，通过增加Ga3+位点的数量，提高GaOx基催化剂的活性。这涉及到通过掺杂材料来增加活性。

3. 调整层状沸石的颗粒大小和晶体相态可以显著调整Zrcus离子浓度。这种调整通过掺杂和还原气氛前处理来促进Zrcus离子的生成，从而增强PDH反应性能。
