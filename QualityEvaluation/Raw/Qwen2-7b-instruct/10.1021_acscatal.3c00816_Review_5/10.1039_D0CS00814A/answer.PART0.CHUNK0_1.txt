<p>Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. During the regeneration step, the CeO2 support can help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters without using corrosive halogens.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention.

<p>Compared with Pt, Ni-based catalysts are of lower cost.

1. Zeolites with special three-dimensional channels, such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and Pt@ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite), are used in PDH reactions. These zeolites have adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas, which prevent the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus improving catalytic stability.

2. Ni-based catalysts, despite being lower cost compared to Pt, can produce significant amounts of CH4 as a side product due to the cleavage of CC bonds. This reduces the selectivity for propylene.

3. GaOx-based catalysts can be improved by doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. Trace Pt modification has been found to help in facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species, enhancing the catalytic activity.

4. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. This improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

5. CeO2 is used as a support in PDH reactions due to its ability to help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters during regeneration without using corrosive halogens. Water vapor can also eliminate coke deposition due to the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.

1. 特殊三维通道的沸石，如Pt@KA（LTA型沸石）和Pt@ZSM-5（MFI型沸石），在PDH反应中被使用。这些沸石具有可调的Si/Al比例和相对较大的表面积，可以防止大分子烃类的形成，从而提高催化稳定性。

2. 尽管镍基催化剂成本较低，但Ni/SiO2催化剂在高活性和丙烷转化率的同时，会产生大量的CH4作为副产品，这是由于CC键断裂的存在，这抑制了丙烯的选择性。

3. GaOx基催化剂可以通过掺杂来提高活性，通过增加协调不饱和Ga3+位点的数量。最近的研究表明，微量铂修改的GaOx是有效的PDH催化剂。他们发现铂促进氢解离并恢复镓氢化物和/或羟基物种，增强催化活性。

4. 层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。与传统沸石相比，这种组合提高了PDH反应的性能。

5. CeO2用作PDH反应中的支持物，因为它能够帮助在再生过程中促进Pt簇的原子再分散，而不使用腐蚀性的卤素。水蒸气也可以通过CeO2的氧化还原性质消除丙烷脱氢过程中沉积的焦炭。
