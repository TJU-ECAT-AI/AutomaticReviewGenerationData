<p>Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. During the regeneration step, the CeO2 support can help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters without using corrosive halogens. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-dimensional channels such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and Pt@ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite) with some unique physical properties.43,83,84 The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability.</p>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention.

<p>Compared with Pt, Ni-based catalysts are of lower cost.

1. Zeolites with special three-dimensional channels, such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and Pt@ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite), are used in PDH reactions. These zeolites have adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas, which prevent the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus improving catalytic stability.

2. Ni-based catalysts, despite being lower cost compared to Pt, can produce significant amounts of CH4 as a side product due to the cleavage of CC bonds. This reduces the selectivity for propylene.

3. GaOx-based catalysts can be improved by doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. Trace Pt modification has been found to help in facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species, enhancing the catalytic activity.

4. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. This improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

5. CeO2 is used as a support in PDH reactions due to its ability to help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters during regeneration without using corrosive halogens. Water vapor can also eliminate coke deposition due to the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 特殊三维通道的沸石，如Pt@KA（LTA型沸石）和Pt@ZSM-5（MFI型沸石），在PDH反应中被使用。这些沸石具有可调的Si/Al比例和相对较大的表面积，可以防止大分子烃类的形成，从而提高催化稳定性。

2. 尽管镍基催化剂成本较低，但Ni/SiO2催化剂在高活性和丙烷转化率的同时，会产生大量的CH4作为副产品，这是由于CC键断裂的存在，这抑制了丙烯的选择性。

3. GaOx基催化剂可以通过掺杂来提高活性，通过增加协调不饱和Ga3+位点的数量。最近的研究表明，微量铂修改的GaOx是有效的PDH催化剂。他们发现铂促进氢解离并恢复镓氢化物和/或羟基物种，增强催化活性。

4. 层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。与传统沸石相比，这种组合提高了PDH反应的性能。

5. CeO2用作PDH反应中的支持物，因为它能够帮助在再生过程中促进Pt簇的原子再分散，而不使用腐蚀性的卤素。水蒸气也可以通过CeO2的氧化还原性质消除丙烷脱氢过程中沉积的焦炭。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reaction to occur, along with easier diffusion paths for reactants and products. These materials typically consist of a core of microporous zeolites encapsulated within a shell of mesoporous or macroporous material. The synthesis methods often involve the use of templating agents to create the hierarchical structure, followed by calcination to remove the templates. The combination of these pores improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by increasing the reaction rate and selectivity.

For example, the micropores allow for efficient adsorption of the reactant propane, while the mesopores or macropores facilitate the diffusion of the reactant to the active sites and the diffusion of products away from the active sites, reducing the risk of product inhibition. This hierarchical structure also enables better control over the pore size distribution, which can be tailored to optimize the reaction conditions for PDH.

In particular, the support acidity plays a critical role in the performance of PDH reactions. To prevent undesirable coke and alkane isomerization, the acidity of the support should be carefully controlled. Alkaline metals like lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) can help poison the strong acid sites on the support, thereby avoiding coke deposition on the surface of the support.

Additionally, materials like ceria (CeO2) have redox properties that can be utilized to eliminate coke deposition during the propane dehydrogenation process. The strong interactions between ceria and metal particles, leading to trapping of Pt atoms in the form of Pt ions, can also contribute to the stability and performance of the catalyst.

Furthermore, the amount of coordinatively unsaturated penta-coordinate aluminum (Al) atoms on the surface of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) can greatly impact the catalytic properties of the material. High amounts of these Al atoms can enhance the stability and activity of the catalyst. The strong interactions between ceria and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions, can also contribute to the stability and performance of the catalyst.

Regarding gallium (Ga), the active sites are debated and influenced by the type of support, preparation method, and loading amount. The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) indicates that the activation of propane occurs through the loss of one hydrogen to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, followed by the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group. The energy barrier for the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3, indicating that the stability of the active sites is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH reaction.

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的反应表面以及反应物和产物更容易扩散的路径来增强PDH反应的可达性。这些材料通常由包含在壳层中的微孔沸石核心组成。合成方法通常涉及使用模板剂创建层级结构，随后通过煅烧去除模板。这种多孔结构的组合可以提高PDH反应性能，通过增加反应速率和选择性。

例如，微孔允许有效吸附反应物丙烷，而介孔或大孔则有利于反应物到达活性位点并从活性位点扩散出产物，从而降低产物抑制的风险。这种层级结构还允许更好地控制孔径大小分布，这可以根据优化PDH条件进行调整。

特别是在支持酸性方面，它对PDH反应性能起着关键作用。为了防止不希望的焦炭和烷烃异构化，应仔细控制支持的酸性。如锂（Li）、钠（Na）和钾（K）等碱金属可以帮助毒化支持上的强酸位点，从而避免焦炭沉积在支持表面上。

此外，铈氧化物（CeO2）具有还原性性质，可以在PDH过程中消除焦炭沉积。与金属颗粒之间的强烈相互作用，导致铂原子以铂离子形式被捕获，也可以促进催化剂的稳定性和性能。

另外，铝（Al）原子表面的五配位铝（Al）原子的数量可以极大地影响材料的催化性能。高数量的这些Al原子可以增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。与铈之间的强烈相互作用，其中铂原子可以被捕获形成铂离子，也可以贡献于催化剂的稳定性和性能。

关于镓（Ga），活性位点存在争议，并且受到支撑类型、制备方法和负载量的影响。DFT计算显示，丙烷在Ga2O3(100)表面的激活首先通过失去一个氢原子形成一个丙基组和一个羟基组，然后通过去除β-H形成另一个羟基组。脱附步骤中吸附氢原子的能量壁垒限制了Ga2O3的活性，表明活性位点的稳定性对于PDH反应效率至关重要。
