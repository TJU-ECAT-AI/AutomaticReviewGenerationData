[1] "In addition, the design uses robust reactor/catalyst regenerator technology that allows the process to be scaled as needed."
[2] "Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions."
[3] "It is difficult to calculate the turnover frequency (TOF) because Pt dispersion values in different catalysts were not given."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The robust reactor/catalyst regenerator technology enables the process to be scaled according to requirements.
2. Strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles trap Pt atoms in the form of Pt ions.
3. Calculating the turnover frequency (TOF) is hard due to varying Pt dispersion values across catalysts.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 坚固的反应器/催化剂再生技术允许过程按需扩展。
2. CeO2与金属粒子之间的强相互作用将Pt原子捕获为Pt离子形式。
3. 由于不同催化剂中的Pt分散度值不同，因此难以计算周转频率（TOF）。
