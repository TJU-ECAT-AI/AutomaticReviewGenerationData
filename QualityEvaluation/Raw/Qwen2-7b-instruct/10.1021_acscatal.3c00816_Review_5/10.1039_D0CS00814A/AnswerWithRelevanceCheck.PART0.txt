          [1] "Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [2] "They can be synthesized using methods such as template-directed synthesis or sol-gel processing."
          [3] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a larger surface area and increased porosity."
          [4] "In addition, the design uses robust reactor/catalyst regenerator technology that allows the process to be scaled as needed."
          [5] "Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions."
