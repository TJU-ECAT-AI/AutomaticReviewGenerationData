[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include H-ZSM-5, MFI, MCM-41, and SBA-15."
[3] "Synthesis methods for these materials involve sol-gel processes, template-directed assembly, and microwave-assisted synthesis."
[4] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a larger accessible surface area and better control over the pore size distribution."
[5] "The enhanced accessibility and controlled pore structure facilitate more efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, leading to higher selectivity and yield."
