1. The interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has grown due to the decrease in propane prices, which resulted from the discovery of large shale gas reserves in North America.

2. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is the most frequently cited explanation for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, which was proposed in 1934.

3. The dissociative adsorption of propane and the cleavage of the first CH bond are often considered the rate-limiting steps in the reaction, although this depends on the specific catalyst used.

4. The turnover frequency (TOF) tends to increase as the size of the Pt particle decreases. However, very small Pt species (<1 nm) exhibit high selectivity, while larger nanoparticles (>3 nm) have high selectivity.

5. Over five dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the CrAl-800 catalyst showed exceptional regenerative capacity, achieving an initial space-time yield (STY) of 60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, which is comparable to many Pt catalysts documented in the literature.

1. 直接丙烷脱氢化领域的兴趣增加，这是由于北美发现大量页岩气储量导致丙烷价格下降的结果。

2. 1934年提出的霍里乌蒂·波兰尼机制是最常引用的催化脱氢化反应解释。

3. 烷烃的离解吸附和第一个CH键的断裂通常被认为是速率限制步骤，这取决于所使用的催化剂。

4. 随着Pt颗粒尺寸的减小，转盘频率（TOF）往往会增加。然而，非常小的Pt物种(<1nm)表现出高的选择性，而较大的纳米粒子(>3nm)具有高选择性。

5. 在五次脱氢再生周期后，CrAl-800催化剂显示出卓越的再生能力，初始空间时间产率（STY）达到60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，这与文献中记录的许多Pt催化剂相当。
