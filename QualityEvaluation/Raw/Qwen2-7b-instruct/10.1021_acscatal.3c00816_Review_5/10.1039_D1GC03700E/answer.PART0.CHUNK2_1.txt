Chen et al. reported that nickel molybdates were active for ODH-O2 and in particular the α-NiMoO4 phase exhibited an enhanced yield compared to NiO and β-NiMoO4.224 Physical grinding of Mo and Ni precursors also led to the absence of NiO in α-NiMoO4 when compared to the analogous co-precipitation technique. It was shown that NiMoO4 had enhanced ODH-O2 performance when comparing mesoporous to bulk catalysts, but only due to the enhanced number of active sites related to the increased surface area, and not the improved mass transfer properties that usually accompany mesoporosity.225

NiO has been found to be detrimental to ODH-O2 selectivity, favouring overoxidation products. Nb was found to be a superior dopant for NiO based catalysts, due to a reduction in the surface concentration of electrophilic O species and increased surface acidity. However, propene was still not the major product over NiO at around 10% conversion,226 suggesting that NiO-based catalysts are limited in their application for ODH-O2. 

In comparison to Nb-NiO catalysts, α-NiMoO4 showed a selectivity of 75% at roughly 10% conversion, with propene being the major product at similar conversions to Nb-NiO. The NiO-polyoxometalates have been shown to stabilise the adsorbed oxygen at the surface, which would limit overoxidation,227 leading to the conclusion that NiO oxygen is too labile to achieve a high selectivity.

When undertaking surface polymeric phosphate modification of NiO nanoparticles (NiO-SPP), an increase in selectivity of 23 times for NiO-SPP's at isoconversion was shown (Table 10, entry 5).228 This is due to the polymeric phosphates weaker interaction with propene when compared to NiO nanoparticles, leading to a higher desorption rate and therefore higher selectivity.

CeO2 was found to be a selective catalyst when HCl was added to the gas feed with O2.229 O2 was hypothesised to have filled the oxygen vacancies at the surface, forming O22 species, which mediated the oxidation of Cl to Cl radicals and resulted in high conversion and selectivity to propene.

Co-Based catalysts have been investigated for ODH-O2, but their performance is also limited and vastly inferior to V- or B-based catalysts. However, Wang et al. developed a Co3O4/ZIF-8 catalyst that could operate at 250 C, which is about 200 C lower than the operating temperature for many ODH-O2 catalysts.232

Tanasoi et al. investigated various mixed metal oxides derived from layered double hydroxide precursors. CoMgAlOx exhibited the highest propene yield, but the propene selectivity was limited due to an increase in cracking, which then led to overoxidation.233

Although CrOx-based catalysts have been widely investigated for DDH and ODH-CO2, there is limited research available for CrOx-catalysts for ODH-O2. Some CrOx-type catalysts have been shown to form propene, with the selective phase being Cr5O12 when supported on nano-crystalline MgO.234

Frank et al. showed that propane can be activated by surface oxygen groups on oxidised carbon nanotubes, noting that sp2 hybridised carbon species are selective and stable for ODH-O2, and that carbon nanotubes provide a balance between reactivity (sp3) and stability (sp2).236 Nanocarbons also show high selectivity to alkenes when compared to metal oxides, but the intrinsic activity is lower.

Cao et al. discovered that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are highly selective to propene (75%) at a moderate conversion of 12.8%. Additionally, selectivity to ethene was 15%, meaning total olefin selectivity was around 90%. The highest STY was measured at 515 C to be 4.0 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 10, entry 11).

Recently, Cao et al. discovered that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are highly selective to propene (75%) at a moderate conversion of 12.8%. Additionally, selectivity to ethene was 15%, meaning total olefin selectivity was around 90%. The materials were shown to be activated in a similar way to h-BN, forming the proposed active site, i.e., carbonyl bonds, on the surface under oxidative conditions. Under these oxidative conditions, the surface area increased from 8.9 m2 g1 to 78.1 m2 g1, due to the formation of mesopores at the surface. The large increase in surface area when compared to the starting material, was a large factor in obtaining the high activity.

High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to interact with the catalyst surface. The main types include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and bifunctional zeolites that integrate both micropores and mesopores. Synthesis methods involve the incorporation of surfactants, templating agents, and controlled pore growth techniques to create the desired pore structure. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating more efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, enhancing surface area, and controlling the pore size and shape to optimize reaction pathways.

In comparison to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer several advantages for PDH reactions:
1. Enhanced surface area and pore volume, which increases the number of active sites for reactions.
2. Controlled pore size and shape, which can tailor the selectivity for specific reaction pathways.
3. Improved thermal stability, which reduces sintering and maintains activity over multiple regeneration cycles.
4. Enhanced mass transfer properties, which improve the kinetics of the PDH reaction.
5. Reduced coke formation, which extends catalyst lifetime and reduces maintenance requirements.

These features collectively result in higher productivity, selectivity, and stability of PDH reactions compared to conventional zeolite catalysts.
