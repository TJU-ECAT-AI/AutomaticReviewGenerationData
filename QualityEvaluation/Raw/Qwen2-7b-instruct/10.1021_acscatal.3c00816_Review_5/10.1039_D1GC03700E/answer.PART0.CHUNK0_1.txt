1. Propene plays a crucial role in modern society as a key platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industries. It is used in the production of polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer that is second only to polyethylene in terms of production scale. Propene is also used in the manufacture of other polymer-related chemicals, including polyurethane, acrylic polymers, and polypropenonitrile, as well as large scale chemicals like isopropanol and cumene.

2. Annual propene production reached approximately 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is forecasted to grow to 191 megatonnes by 2030. The rise in demand for propene cannot be met by existing processes, such as steam-cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are based on fossil fuels.

3. The atom economy of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH-CO2) is 48%, which is the lowest among the three dehydrogenation processes discussed. However, this is still respectable compared to cracking processes where propene is a minor product.

4. The falling price of propane in North America, primarily due to the discovery of vast shale gas reserves, has significantly boosted the interest in direct propane dehydrogenation.

5. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is vital for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near and long-term future.

6. Gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) is characterized by a high number and density of medium-strong acid sites, which can lead to unwanted side reactions during the dehydrogenation process.

7. Recent advancements in the use of various supports and catalysis synthesis methods for platinum-based catalysts have been explored to enhance the structureactivity correlations of the catalysts.

1. 在现代社会中，丙烯的作用不可或缺。它是关键的平台化学品，在聚合物和化学工业中有广泛应用。它主要用于生产聚丙烯，这种可回收的热塑性聚合物在生产规模上仅次于聚乙烯。丙烯还用于制造其他与聚合物相关的化学品，包括聚氨酯、丙烯酸聚合物和聚丙烯腈，以及大型化学品如异丙醇和环己酮。

2. 丙烯的年产量在2019年约为13亿吨，并预测到2030年将增长至191亿吨。对丙烯的需求无法通过基于化石燃料的现有过程（如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化）满足。

3. 氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODH-CO2）的原子经济为48%，这是三种脱氢过程中最低的。然而，这在与丙烷是副产品的裂解过程中仍然相当可接受。

4. 由于北美发现巨大的页岩气储备导致丙烷价格下跌，直接丙烷脱氢的兴趣显著增加。

5. 发展活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于考虑脱氢在未来近期内及长远未来成为可行过程至关重要。

6. 硅酸铝（γ-Al2O3）具有高数量和密度的中等强度酸性位点，可能导致脱氢过程中出现不希望的副反应。

7. 近年来，对各种支持材料和催化合成方法的研究，以增强铂基催化剂的结构活性关系，已经取得进展。
