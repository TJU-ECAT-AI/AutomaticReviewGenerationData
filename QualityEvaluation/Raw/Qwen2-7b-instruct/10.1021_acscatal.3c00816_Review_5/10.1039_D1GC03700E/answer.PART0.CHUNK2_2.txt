[1] "Hierarchical zeolites are engineered to incorporate both micropores and mesopores/macropores into their structure."
[2] "These materials often utilize a sacrificial template approach, where a porous material is used to create a mold that can be removed, leaving behind a hierarchical zeolite structure."
[3] "The combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in these materials improves accessibility for PDH reactions by enhancing both adsorption and diffusion properties."
[4] "This leads to a higher surface area and greater pore volume compared to traditional zeolites, facilitating more efficient PDH reactions."
[5] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their optimized pore structure."

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance PDH reaction accessibility. They are synthesized using a sacrificial template method, resulting in a structure with both types of pores. This design improves adsorption and diffusion properties, boosting surface area and pore volume compared to conventional zeolites. Consequently, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate superior PDH reaction performance due to their optimized pore structure.

层级沸石将微孔和介孔/大孔结合在一起，以提高PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过牺牲模板方法合成，形成包含两种类型的孔结构。这种设计改进了吸附和扩散性能，增加了比表面积和孔体积，与传统沸石相比。因此，层级沸石由于其优化的孔结构，在PDH反应中表现出更优的性能。
