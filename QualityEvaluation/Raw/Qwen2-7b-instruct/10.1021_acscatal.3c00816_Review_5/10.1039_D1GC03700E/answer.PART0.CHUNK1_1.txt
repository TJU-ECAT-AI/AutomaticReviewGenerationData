[1] "Recently, there has been a growing interest in the development of hierarchical zeolites for various catalytic processes, including PDH reactions."
[2] "These materials combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[3] "Hierarchical zeolites are synthesized using a variety of methods, including template-directed synthesis, sol-gel processes, and co-condensation techniques."
[4] "The inclusion of mesopores and macropores improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing a larger surface area for catalytic sites and facilitating better mass transfer."
[5] "This results in higher catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as improved stability and longer operational lifetimes."

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance PDH reaction accessibility. They are synthesized via template-directed, sol-gel, and co-condensation methods. This design boosts catalytic activities, selectivities, stability, and operational lifetimes by offering a larger surface area for catalytic sites and facilitating better mass transfer.
