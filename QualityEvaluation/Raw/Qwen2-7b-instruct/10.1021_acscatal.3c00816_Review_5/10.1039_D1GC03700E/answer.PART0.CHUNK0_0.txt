Hierarchical zeolites enhance the accessibility for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by integrating micropores and mesopores/macropores, which improves surface area and porosity. This combination allows for better control over pore size, facilitating easier access for reactants and products. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include templated synthesis, self-assembly, and post-synthesis modification methods. Synthesis typically involves template-assisted growth to create zeolite crystals with desired pore sizes. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer enhanced surface area, controlled pore size, and improved accessibility, leading to better performance in PDH reactions. The enhanced accessibility allows for more efficient catalyst utilization, resulting in higher yields and selectivities. Hierarchical zeolites have been shown to improve PDH reaction performance by providing an optimal environment for the dehydrogenation process, with precise control over reaction pathways. Synthesis often utilizes templates to guide the growth of zeolite crystals with specific pore sizes, enabling materials tailored for specific applications.
