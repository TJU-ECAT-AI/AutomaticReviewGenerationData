The main types of hierarchical zeolites encompass spherical, tubular, and layered structures. Synthesis methods involve utilizing templates, like silica, to guide the growth of zeolite formations. These materials are especially beneficial for PDH reactions due to their ability to provide a balance between high surface area and controlled pore size. The increased surface area and controlled pore size of hierarchical zeolites result in enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.
