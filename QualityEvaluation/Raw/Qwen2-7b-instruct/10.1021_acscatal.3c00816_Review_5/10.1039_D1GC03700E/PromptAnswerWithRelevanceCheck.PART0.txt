1. Propene plays a crucial role in modern society as a key platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industries. It is used in the production of polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer that is second only to polyethylene in terms of production scale. Propene is also used in the manufacture of other polymer-related chemicals, including polyurethane, acrylic polymers, and polypropenonitrile, as well as large scale chemicals like isopropanol and cumene.

2. Annual propene production reached approximately 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is forecasted to grow to 191 megatonnes by 2030. The rise in demand for propene cannot be met by existing processes, such as steam-cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are based on fossil fuels.

3. The atom economy of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH-CO2) is 48%, which is the lowest among the three dehydrogenation processes discussed. However, this is still respectable compared to cracking processes where propene is a minor product.

4. The falling price of propane in North America, primarily due to the discovery of vast shale gas reserves, has significantly boosted the interest in direct propane dehydrogenation.

5. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is vital for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near and long-term future.

6. Gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) is characterized by a high number and density of medium-strong acid sites, which can lead to unwanted side reactions during the dehydrogenation process.

7. Recent advancements in the use of various supports and catalysis synthesis methods for platinum-based catalysts have been explored to enhance the structureactivity correlations of the catalysts.

Chen et al. reported that nickel molybdates were active for ODH-O2 and in particular the α-NiMoO4 phase exhibited an enhanced yield compared to NiO and β-NiMoO4.224 Physical grinding of Mo and Ni precursors also led to the absence of NiO in α-NiMoO4 when compared to the analogous co-precipitation technique. It was shown that NiMoO4 had enhanced ODH-O2 performance when comparing mesoporous to bulk catalysts, but only due to the enhanced number of active sites related to the increased surface area, and not the improved mass transfer properties that usually accompany mesoporosity.225

NiO has been found to be detrimental to ODH-O2 selectivity, favouring overoxidation products. Nb was found to be a superior dopant for NiO based catalysts, due to a reduction in the surface concentration of electrophilic O species and increased surface acidity. However, propene was still not the major product over NiO at around 10% conversion,226 suggesting that NiO-based catalysts are limited in their application for ODH-O2. 

In comparison to Nb-NiO catalysts, α-NiMoO4 showed a selectivity of 75% at roughly 10% conversion, with propene being the major product at similar conversions to Nb-NiO. The NiO-polyoxometalates have been shown to stabilise the adsorbed oxygen at the surface, which would limit overoxidation,227 leading to the conclusion that NiO oxygen is too labile to achieve a high selectivity.

When undertaking surface polymeric phosphate modification of NiO nanoparticles (NiO-SPP), an increase in selectivity of 23 times for NiO-SPP's at isoconversion was shown (Table 10, entry 5).228 This is due to the polymeric phosphates weaker interaction with propene when compared to NiO nanoparticles, leading to a higher desorption rate and therefore higher selectivity.

CeO2 was found to be a selective catalyst when HCl was added to the gas feed with O2.229 O2 was hypothesised to have filled the oxygen vacancies at the surface, forming O22 species, which mediated the oxidation of Cl to Cl radicals and resulted in high conversion and selectivity to propene.

Co-Based catalysts have been investigated for ODH-O2, but their performance is also limited and vastly inferior to V- or B-based catalysts. However, Wang et al. developed a Co3O4/ZIF-8 catalyst that could operate at 250 C, which is about 200 C lower than the operating temperature for many ODH-O2 catalysts.232

Tanasoi et al. investigated various mixed metal oxides derived from layered double hydroxide precursors. CoMgAlOx exhibited the highest propene yield, but the propene selectivity was limited due to an increase in cracking, which then led to overoxidation.233

Although CrOx-based catalysts have been widely investigated for DDH and ODH-CO2, there is limited research available for CrOx-catalysts for ODH-O2. Some CrOx-type catalysts have been shown to form propene, with the selective phase being Cr5O12 when supported on nano-crystalline MgO.234

Frank et al. showed that propane can be activated by surface oxygen groups on oxidised carbon nanotubes, noting that sp2 hybridised carbon species are selective and stable for ODH-O2, and that carbon nanotubes provide a balance between reactivity (sp3) and stability (sp2).236 Nanocarbons also show high selectivity to alkenes when compared to metal oxides, but the intrinsic activity is lower.

Cao et al. discovered that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are highly selective to propene (75%) at a moderate conversion of 12.8%. Additionally, selectivity to ethene was 15%, meaning total olefin selectivity was around 90%. The highest STY was measured at 515 C to be 4.0 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 10, entry 11).

Recently, Cao et al. discovered that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are highly selective to propene (75%) at a moderate conversion of 12.8%. Additionally, selectivity to ethene was 15%, meaning total olefin selectivity was around 90%. The materials were shown to be activated in a similar way to h-BN, forming the proposed active site, i.e., carbonyl bonds, on the surface under oxidative conditions. Under these oxidative conditions, the surface area increased from 8.9 m2 g1 to 78.1 m2 g1, due to the formation of mesopores at the surface. The large increase in surface area when compared to the starting material, was a large factor in obtaining the high activity.

High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to interact with the catalyst surface. The main types include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and bifunctional zeolites that integrate both micropores and mesopores. Synthesis methods involve the incorporation of surfactants, templating agents, and controlled pore growth techniques to create the desired pore structure. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating more efficient adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, enhancing surface area, and controlling the pore size and shape to optimize reaction pathways.

In comparison to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer several advantages for PDH reactions:
1. Enhanced surface area and pore volume, which increases the number of active sites for reactions.
2. Controlled pore size and shape, which can tailor the selectivity for specific reaction pathways.
3. Improved thermal stability, which reduces sintering and maintains activity over multiple regeneration cycles.
4. Enhanced mass transfer properties, which improve the kinetics of the PDH reaction.
5. Reduced coke formation, which extends catalyst lifetime and reduces maintenance requirements.

These features collectively result in higher productivity, selectivity, and stability of PDH reactions compared to conventional zeolite catalysts.

[1] "Many studies have investigated VOx-based catalysts, which in some cases have been said to exhibit a catalyst performance similar to that of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts."
[2] "However, comparing the typical STY values for VOx with those of CrOx or Pt, it is clear that the VOx catalysts reported in the literature are not as active as supported CrOx or Pt catalysts."
[3] "In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species."
[4] "Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method."
[5] "On the other hand, the role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts."
[6] "The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts."
</quotes>

The VOx-based catalysts have been extensively studied and are considered to perform comparably to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in some cases. However, the typical STY values for VOx catalysts are significantly lower than those of CrOx or Pt catalysts. The nature of the support plays a crucial role in the performance of these catalysts due to its impact on the formation of different surface VOx species and the importance of metalsupport interactions. Researchers have managed to tune the relative proportion and stability of the most active V species by altering the preparation method. Nevertheless, the roles of other V species in the DDH reaction remain uncertain. Studies suggest that further research on this aspect could lead to the development of more active and stable DDH catalysts. Currently, the most effective VOx catalysts are estimated to be 34 times less active than the most potent Pt catalysts.

许多研究已经调查了VOx催化剂，它们在某些情况下被认为与Pt-和CrOx催化剂的表现相似。然而，VOx催化剂的典型STY值远低于CrOx或Pt催化剂。支持材料的性质对这些催化剂的性能至关重要，因为它影响表面VOx物种的形成以及金属-支持相互作用的重要性。研究人员通过改变制备方法，成功地调整了活性最高的V物种的比例和稳定性。然而，其他V物种在DDH反应中的作用仍然不确定。研究表明，进一步研究这一方面可以促进更活跃和稳定的DDH催化剂的发展。目前，最有效的VOx催化剂估计比最有效的Pt催化剂低34倍。
