[1] "Many studies have investigated VOx-based catalysts, which in some cases have been said to exhibit a catalyst performance similar to that of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts."
[2] "However, comparing the typical STY values for VOx with those of CrOx or Pt, it is clear that the VOx catalysts reported in the literature are not as active as supported CrOx or Pt catalysts."
[3] "In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species."
[4] "Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method."
[5] "On the other hand, the role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts."
[6] "The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts."

The VOx-based catalysts have been extensively studied and are considered to perform comparably to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in some cases. However, the typical STY values for VOx catalysts are significantly lower than those of CrOx or Pt catalysts. The nature of the support plays a crucial role in the performance of these catalysts due to its impact on the formation of different surface VOx species and the importance of metalsupport interactions. Researchers have managed to tune the relative proportion and stability of the most active V species by altering the preparation method. Nevertheless, the roles of other V species in the DDH reaction remain uncertain. Studies suggest that further research on this aspect could lead to the development of more active and stable DDH catalysts. Currently, the most effective VOx catalysts are estimated to be 34 times less active than the most potent Pt catalysts.

许多研究已经调查了VOx催化剂，它们在某些情况下被认为与Pt-和CrOx催化剂的表现相似。然而，VOx催化剂的典型STY值远低于CrOx或Pt催化剂。支持材料的性质对这些催化剂的性能至关重要，因为它影响表面VOx物种的形成以及金属-支持相互作用的重要性。研究人员通过改变制备方法，成功地调整了活性最高的V物种的比例和稳定性。然而，其他V物种在DDH反应中的作用仍然不确定。研究表明，进一步研究这一方面可以促进更活跃和稳定的DDH催化剂的发展。目前，最有效的VOx催化剂估计比最有效的Pt催化剂低34倍。
