[3] "Removing the organic agents leads to the formation of 3D Pt@MCM-22, in which subnanometric Pt species are confined in the external cups on the surface or encapsulated in the supercages of MCM-22."
[4] "The structures of as-prepared Pt@MCM-22 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field detector high-resolution scanning TEM imaging (HAADF-HRSTEM imaging)."

During the synthesis, a solution containing subnanometric Pt species is added to the layered MWW zeolitic precursor during the swelling process. After the swelling process, subnanometric Pt species and surfactant molecules are located between the layers. Organic agents are removed, leading to the formation of 3D Pt@MCM-22 with subnanometric Pt species confined in external cups on the surface or encapsulated in the supercages of MCM-22. Structures of Pt@MCM-22 are characterized using TEM and HAADF-HRSTEM imaging. Zeolite beam sensitivity prevents focal-series studies from determining the location of atoms/clusters. The size distribution of subnanometric Pt species spans from single atoms to Pt clusters nearly 1nm in size, with most being between 0.2 and 0.7nm.
