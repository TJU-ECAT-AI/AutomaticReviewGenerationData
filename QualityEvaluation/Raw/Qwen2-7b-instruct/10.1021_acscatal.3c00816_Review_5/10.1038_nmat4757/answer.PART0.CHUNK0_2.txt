[1] "The synthesis process involves adding a solution containing subnanometric Pt species to the layered MWW zeolitic precursor during the swelling process."
[2] "After the swelling process, subnanometric Pt species as well as surfactant molecules are located between the layers."
[3] "Removing the organic agents leads to the formation of 3D Pt@MCM-22, in which subnanometric Pt species are confined in the external cups on the surface or encapsulated in the supercages of MCM-22."
[4] "The structures of as-prepared Pt@MCM-22 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field detector high-resolution scanning TEM imaging (HAADF-HRSTEM imaging)."
[5] "Due to the beam sensitivity of zeolites, the location of the atoms/clusters cannot be investigated by focal-series studies."
[6] "The size distribution of subnanometric Pt species ranges from single atoms to Pt clusters nearly to 1nm in size, with a majority for Pt clusters between 0.20.7nm."

During the synthesis, a solution containing subnanometric Pt species is added to the layered MWW zeolitic precursor during the swelling process. After the swelling process, subnanometric Pt species and surfactant molecules are located between the layers. Organic agents are removed, leading to the formation of 3D Pt@MCM-22 with subnanometric Pt species confined in external cups on the surface or encapsulated in the supercages of MCM-22. Structures of Pt@MCM-22 are characterized using TEM and HAADF-HRSTEM imaging. Zeolite beam sensitivity prevents focal-series studies from determining the location of atoms/clusters. The size distribution of subnanometric Pt species spans from single atoms to Pt clusters nearly 1nm in size, with most being between 0.2 and 0.7nm.

在合成过程中，将包含亚纳米级Pt物种的溶液添加到层状MWW沸石前体的膨胀过程中。膨胀过程后，亚纳米级Pt物种以及表面活性剂分子位于层之间。去除有机化合物导致形成3D Pt@MCM-22，在其中亚纳米级Pt物种被限制在表面的外部杯子中或封装在MCM-22的超笼中。使用透射电子显微镜（TEM）和高角度环形暗场探测器高分辨率扫描TEM成像（HAADF-HRSTEM成像）对制备的Pt@MCM-22进行结构表征。由于沸石的束敏感性，无法通过焦点系列研究来确定原子/簇的位置。亚纳米级Pt物种的大小分布从单个原子到接近1nm大小的Pt簇，其中大多数为0.2至0.7nm。
