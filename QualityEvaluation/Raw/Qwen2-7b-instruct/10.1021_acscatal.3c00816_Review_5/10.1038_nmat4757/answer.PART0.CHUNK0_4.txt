1. A new strategy was introduced for creating zeolite-confined subnanometric Pt species catalysts that exhibit high stability during the transformation of a 2D zeolite into a 3D structure.

2. MCM-22, specifically the MWW type zeolite, was selected as the starting material. The expectation was that during the condensation of the layered zeolite precursor, the hemi-cages and cages with internal dimensions of 0.7 and 0.7 × 1.8nm would capture the subnanometric Pt species.

3. The subnanometric Pt species were stabilized by MCM-22, even after being treated in air up to 540°C.

4. The Pt species confined within the zeolite's framework cavities showed size-selective catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of alkenes.

5. After high-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments, the encapsulated Pt species grew into small nanoparticles approximately 1 to 2nm in size.

6. This innovative method offers a potential for producing highly stable subnanometric metal catalysts suitable for high-temperature catalytic reactions in pure siliceous zeolites.
