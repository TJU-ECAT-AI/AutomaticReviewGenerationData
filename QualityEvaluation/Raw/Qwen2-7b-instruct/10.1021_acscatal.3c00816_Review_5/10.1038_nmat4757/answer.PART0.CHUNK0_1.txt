The exceptional stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been proven through oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C. After one cycle of such treatment, small Pt NPs of about 1nm can be detected in Pt@MCM-22. As more cycles are subjected, Pt clusters expand in size. However, their size distributions indicate that most of the small Pt NPs remain under 2nm.
