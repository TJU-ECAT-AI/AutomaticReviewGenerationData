1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials are MFI, MEL, and BEA. Synthesis techniques include template-directed assembly, sol-gel processes, and vapor-phase exchange. Hierarchical zeolites enhance the performance of PDH reactions by offering a greater surface area and a more accessible pore structure.
