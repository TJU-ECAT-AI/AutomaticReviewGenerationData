[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include H-ZSM-5, H-Y, H-MFI, and H-MCM-41."
[3] "Synthesis methods typically involve a vapor-phase exchange of the parent zeolite with a metal salt."
[4] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by providing more active sites and better mass transport properties."
[5] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show higher activity and selectivity due to their unique pore architecture."
