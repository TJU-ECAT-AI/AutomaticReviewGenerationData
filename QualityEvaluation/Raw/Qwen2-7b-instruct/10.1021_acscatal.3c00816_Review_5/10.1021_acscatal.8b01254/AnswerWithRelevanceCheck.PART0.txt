          [1] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced surface area and pore size distribution."
          [2] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by providing more active sites and better mass transport properties."
          [3] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show higher activity and selectivity due to their unique pore architecture."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          Hierarchical zeolites enhance the performance of PDH reactions over traditional zeolites thanks to their increased surface area, pore size distribution, more active sites, and better mass transport properties. They also exhibit higher activity and selectivity due to their distinctive pore structure.
