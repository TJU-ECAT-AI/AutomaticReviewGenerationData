Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing more surface area and better selectivity. The main types of these materials include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and hybrid zeolites. They are synthesized through template-directed synthesis, sol-gel process, and hydrothermal treatment.
