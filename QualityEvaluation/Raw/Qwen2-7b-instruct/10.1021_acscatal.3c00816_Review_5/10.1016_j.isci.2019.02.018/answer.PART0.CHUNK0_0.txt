[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH."
[7] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products, which improves the efficiency of the catalytic process. This design allows for better contact between the reactants and the active sites, thereby increasing the reaction rate and yield. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), mesoporous silicas, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These materials can be synthesized through various methods such as sol-gel, template-assisted, and chemical vapor deposition techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit enhanced properties due to their tailored pore structures and surface functionalities, leading to improved performance in PDH reactions.

2. In the context of the study presented, the catalysts designed for PDH reactions consist of ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles encapsulated within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer on a Silicalite-1 support. The NC layer serves to control the size of the ZnO nanoparticles, preventing them from sintering and volatilizing at high temperatures, which enhances the stability and longevity of the catalyst. This approach results in catalysts that display high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability during PDH reactions, achieving a propene selectivity of approximately 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours of operation.

1. 级联沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，为PDH反应提供增强的可访问性，从而提高催化过程的效率。这种设计允许更好的反应物与活性位点接触，进而增加反应速率和产率。级联沸石的主要类型包括杂环咪唑骨架（ZIFs）、多孔硅和金属有机框架（MOFs）。这些材料可以通过溶胶-凝胶法、模板辅助法和化学气相沉积技术等方法合成。与传统沸石相比，级联沸石往往由于其定制的孔结构和表面功能而表现出增强的性能，在PDH反应中表现出更优的表现。

2. 在研究中所描述的情况下，PDH反应所设计的催化剂由超小型ZnO纳米颗粒包裹在氮掺杂碳（NC）层中，该层位于Silicalite-1支持上。NC层用于控制ZnO纳米颗粒的大小，防止它们在高温下烧结和挥发，从而增强催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。这种方法导致催化剂在PDH反应中展现出高活性、选择性和在线稳定性，实现约90%的丙烯选择性，丙烷转化率为44.4%，在600°C操作近6小时后。
