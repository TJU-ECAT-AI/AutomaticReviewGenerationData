[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH."
[7] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for adsorption and reaction sites. This structure improves the efficiency of the reactions by allowing better contact between reactants and the catalyst surface.

2. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with interconnected pore systems, such as mesoporous-microporous composites, and those with macroscopic pores. Synthesis methods typically involve templating strategies that incorporate both micropore and mesopore templates during the growth process. These materials are synthesized through hydrothermal or sol-gel methods, often incorporating organic linkers or metal ions to create the desired pore structures.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and better thermal stability. This leads to higher activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability, making them more suitable for commercial applications.

1. 层级沸石通过提供更大的吸附和反应位点表面面积，将微孔和介孔/大孔结合在一起，以增强丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的可达性。这种结构通过提高反应物与催化剂表面的接触效率来提高反应效率。

2. 主要类型的层级沸石包括具有互连孔系统的类型，如微孔-介孔复合材料，以及具有宏观孔的类型。合成方法通常涉及在生长过程中采用微孔和介孔模板的模板策略。这些材料通过水热法或溶胶-凝胶法合成，常引入有机链接物或金属离子来创建所需的孔结构。

3. 与传统沸石相比，层级沸石在PDH反应中的性能有所提高，得益于其增强的表面积、孔径大小分布的控制和更好的热稳定性。这导致更高的活性、选择性和在线稳定性，使它们更适合商业应用。
