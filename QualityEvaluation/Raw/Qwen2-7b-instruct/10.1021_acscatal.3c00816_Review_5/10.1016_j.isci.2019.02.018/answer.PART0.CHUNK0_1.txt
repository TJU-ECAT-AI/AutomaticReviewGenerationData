[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH."
[7] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. The micropores ensure a high surface area for adsorption and reaction, while the mesopores/macropores facilitate easier diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and silicalite-1. The synthesis methods involve chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel processes, and template-directed assembly. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore structures, which optimize the reaction environment and increase the efficiency of reactant adsorption and product release.

层次状沸石通过提供多个反应物和产物的通道来增强PDH反应的可接近性，结合了微孔和介孔/大孔。微孔确保了高的比表面积以吸附和反应，而介孔/大孔则促进了反应物和产物的更容易扩散。这些材料的主要类型包括杂环咪唑骨架(ZIFs)、金属有机框架(MOFs)和硅铝酸盐-1。合成方法包括化学气相沉积、溶胶-凝胶过程和模板导向组装。与传统沸石相比，这些材料在性能上有所提高，因为它们优化了反应环境，提高了反应物吸附和产物释放的效率，通过改进的孔结构来实现这一点。
