<p>Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively.</p>
<p>The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals.</p>
<p>Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications.</p>
<p>The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support.</p>
<p>The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures.</p>
<p>The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH.</p>
<p>Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600°C after nearly 6 h on stream.</p>

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a highly porous structure that increases the surface area available for chemical reactions. This structure allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, facilitating efficient C-H activation. The main types of these materials include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), which are synthesized through coordination polymerization, and silicalite-1, a type of zeolite known for its high silica content and stability. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore architecture, which leads to increased reactivity and selectivity, as well as better resistance to sintering and volatilization at high temperatures.

层级沸石通过提供高度多孔结构来增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而增加了可用于化学反应的表面积。这种结构通过增加反应物和产物的扩散效率，促进了有效的C-H活化。这些材料的主要类型包括杂环咪唑框架(ZIF)，它通过配合聚合合成，以及一种称为硅酸盐-1的沸石，因其高硅含量和稳定性而闻名。与传统沸石相比，层级沸石在PDH反应中的表现更优，因为其增强的孔结构导致了更高的活性、选择性和更好的高温下抗聚集和挥发性。
