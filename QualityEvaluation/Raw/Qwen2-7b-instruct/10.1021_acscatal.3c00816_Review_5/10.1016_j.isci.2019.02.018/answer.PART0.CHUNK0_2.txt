[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH."
[7] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products, thus improving the efficiency of the catalytic process. The micropores facilitate the diffusion of small molecules, while the mesopores and macropores allow larger molecules to enter and exit, ensuring optimal reaction conditions throughout the material.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and modified natural zeolites. These materials are synthesized through various methods such as solution chemistry, template-directed synthesis, and sol-gel processes. They often exhibit enhanced stability and activity due to their well-defined pore structures and tunable surface functionalities.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore sizes, and improved thermal stability. This results in higher selectivity and activity, lower energy consumption, and better resistance to sintering and volatilization, leading to longer operational lifetimes and more efficient use of resources.

1. 分级沸石通过提供多种途径来增强PDH反应的可及性，从而提高催化过程的效率。微孔有利于小分子的扩散，而介孔和大孔允许较大分子进入和退出，确保在整个材料中实现最优的反应条件。

2. 分级沸石的主要类型包括杂环咪唑框架（ZIF）、金属有机框架（MOF）和改性天然沸石。这些材料通过溶液化学、模板导向合成和水热合成等方法进行合成。它们通常因其定义明确的孔结构和可调表面功能而表现出增强的稳定性和活性。

3. 相比传统的沸石，分级沸石在PDH反应中的表现更为出色，这归功于其增强的表面积、可控的孔径大小和更优异的热稳定性。这导致更高的选择性和活性、更低的能量消耗以及对烧结和挥发性的更好抵抗，从而延长了运行时间并更有效地利用资源。
