1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products, which improves the efficiency of the catalytic process. This design allows for better contact between the reactants and the active sites, thereby increasing the reaction rate and yield. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), mesoporous silicas, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These materials can be synthesized through various methods such as sol-gel, template-assisted, and chemical vapor deposition techniques. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit enhanced properties due to their tailored pore structures and surface functionalities, leading to improved performance in PDH reactions.

2. In the context of the study presented, the catalysts designed for PDH reactions consist of ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles encapsulated within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer on a Silicalite-1 support. The NC layer serves to control the size of the ZnO nanoparticles, preventing them from sintering and volatilizing at high temperatures, which enhances the stability and longevity of the catalyst. This approach results in catalysts that display high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability during PDH reactions, achieving a propene selectivity of approximately 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours of operation.

2. 在研究中所描述的情况下，PDH反应所设计的催化剂由超小型ZnO纳米颗粒包裹在氮掺杂碳（NC）层中，该层位于Silicalite-1支持上。NC层用于控制ZnO纳米颗粒的大小，防止它们在高温下烧结和挥发，从而增强催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。这种方法导致催化剂在PDH反应中展现出高活性、选择性和在线稳定性，实现约90%的丙烯选择性，丙烷转化率为44.4%，在600°C操作近6小时后。

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products. The micropores ensure a high surface area for adsorption and reaction, while the mesopores/macropores facilitate easier diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and silicalite-1. The synthesis methods involve chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel processes, and template-directed assembly. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore structures, which optimize the reaction environment and increase the efficiency of reactant adsorption and product release.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products, thus improving the efficiency of the catalytic process. The micropores facilitate the diffusion of small molecules, while the mesopores and macropores allow larger molecules to enter and exit, ensuring optimal reaction conditions throughout the material.

2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and modified natural zeolites. These materials are synthesized through various methods such as solution chemistry, template-directed synthesis, and sol-gel processes. They often exhibit enhanced stability and activity due to their well-defined pore structures and tunable surface functionalities.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore sizes, and improved thermal stability. This results in higher selectivity and activity, lower energy consumption, and better resistance to sintering and volatilization, leading to longer operational lifetimes and more efficient use of resources.
