<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas.</p>
<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst.</p>
<p>Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactant adsorption and facilitating diffusion paths for products. They are synthesized using methods like hydrothermal synthesis, ion-exchange, and impregnation. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve PDH performance by offering better selectivity and stability, allowing for higher conversion rates and propylene yields.

分层沸石，通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的表面积以促进反应物吸附并为产物扩散路径提供便利，从而增强PDH反应的可访问性。它们通过热液合成、离子交换和浸渍等方法进行合成。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供更好的选择性和稳定性来提高PDH性能，允许更高的转化率和丙烯产率。
