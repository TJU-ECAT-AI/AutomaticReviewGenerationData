[1] "The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene."

[8] "Therefore, a general trend can be observed that the amount of Lewis acid in H-Beta, Sn-Beta, and Na-Sn-Beta are identical, but the amount of Brnsted acid follows a sequence of H-Beta > Sn-Beta > Na-Sn-Beta."
[9] "The Sn species are incorporated into zeolite framework and exist as isolated Sn single atoms."
[10] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation."
