<p>It should be noted that no evident particles or clusters relative SnO2 phase is detectable in TEM of Sn-Beta, which indirectly suggests that the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to diffuse through the material, increasing the surface area for interactions, and potentially reducing diffusion limitations. The main types of these materials are typically categorized by their pore size distribution, such as mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which offer a combination of high surface areas and larger pore sizes compared to traditional microporous zeolites. Synthesis methods for these materials often involve template-directed processes, sol-gel routes, and calcination treatments to control pore size and structure. These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating better contact between reactants and catalyst sites, reducing energy barriers for reactions, and enhancing product selectivity.

2. The synthesis of Sn-Beta catalysts involves a two-step post-synthesis procedure: first, dealumination of the parent H-Beta zeolite using a high concentration of HNO3 to remove aluminum atoms and create lattice defects, and then incorporation of Sn species into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite. This indirect synthesis route is effective in removing aluminum atoms efficiently and preserving the zeolite's textural properties.

3. Theoretical calculations in Sn-Beta zeolite demonstrate that the direct pathway for propane dehydrogenation is more favorable than the indirect pathway, especially in open Sn(OH)2 sites. Open sites seem to be more reactive than closed ones due to their flexibility and ability to form hydrogen bonds with adjacent silanol nests, which can stabilize intermediates and facilitate reactions.

1. 层级沸石通过提供多种路径来增加反应物和产物通过材料的扩散途径，增强PDH反应的可接近性，同时通过提高表面积促进相互作用并可能降低扩散限制。这些材料的主要类型通常根据其孔径大小分布进行分类，如介孔和大孔沸石，它们与传统微孔沸石相比提供了较高的表面积和更大的孔径。层级沸石的合成方法通常涉及模板导向过程、溶胶-凝胶路线以及煅烧处理以控制孔径大小和结构。这些层级沸石通过提高催化剂位点与反应物的接触、降低反应势垒并增强产品选择性来改善PDH反应性能。

2. Sn-Beta催化剂的合成涉及两步后合成程序：首先，使用高浓度的硝酸处理母体H-Beta沸石以去除铝原子并产生晶格缺陷，然后将Sn物种注入空位中形成含Sn沸石。这种间接合成途径有效地高效地移除了铝原子并保留了沸石的纹理特性。

3. 在Sn-Beta沸石中进行的理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢直接路径比间接路径更为有利，尤其是在开放的Sn(OH)2位点上。开放位点似乎比封闭位点更具有活性，因为它们可以形成与相邻硅醇巢之间的氢键，稳定中间体并促进反应。
