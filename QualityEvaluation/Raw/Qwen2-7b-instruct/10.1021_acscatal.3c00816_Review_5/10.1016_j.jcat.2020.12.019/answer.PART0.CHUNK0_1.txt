The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] . Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction [21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[27] . A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction, and in-situ characterization studies reveal that single-site Zn(II) ions located in the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction [22] ,[25] . The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 C with stable activity over 24  h for propane dehydrogenation. Calculations with hybrid density functional theory suggests a non-redox mechanism for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by Co2+ similar to the pathway of single-site Zn2+/SiO2 [27] . The mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites show much higher activity in propane dehydrogenation than their dinuclear silica-supported counterparts, and the propane dehydrogenation reaction requires the presence of Al-O-Ga bonds to promote heterolytic C-H bond activation [23] ,[24] .

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants and products. The main types of these materials include single-site catalysts where metal species are incorporated into zeolite frameworks, creating isolated metal sites that can act as active centers for reactions. Synthesis methods involve loading metal species onto metal oxides like SiO2 and Al2O3. These isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in PDH reactions, achieving a high selectivity of over 95% in silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalysts. In-situ characterization studies show that single-site Zn(II) ions located in strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Other single-site catalysts, such as Co2+ on SiO2 and mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites, also exhibit high selectivity and stability. Hybrid density functional theory calculations suggest non-redox mechanisms for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by these metal sites similar to those of single-site Zn2+/SiO2.

这些材料的主要类型包括将金属物种集成到沸石框架中的单个站点催化剂，通过这种方式可以形成孤立的金属位点作为反应的活性中心。合成方法涉及在金属氧化物如SiO2和Al2O3上加载金属物种。这些孤立的金属氧化物物种在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高性能，实现了在硅胶支持的单个站点Zn(II)催化剂中超过95％的选择性。原位表征研究表明，位于无定形硅胶表面受拉三元环中的单个站点Zn(II)离子是丙烷脱氢反应的活性位点。其他单个站点催化剂，如SiO2上的Co2+和单核铝基单个站点Ga位点，也表现出高选择性和稳定性。杂化密度泛函理论计算表明，这些金属位点用于激活C-H和H-H键的非还原机制与单个站点Zn2+/SiO2类似。

The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30] ,[31] . As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] .

However, the Sn-Beta exhibits insignificant activity in the reaction and merely serves as a support and promoter for the Pt component [32],[33],[34].
