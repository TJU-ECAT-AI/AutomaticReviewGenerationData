<p>Propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by single Lewis acid site in Sn-Beta zeolite Highlights • Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites is able to activate C-H bond. • Sn-Beta zeolite exhibits high performance in propane dehydrogenation. • Theoretical calculation suggest that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites.</p>
<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene [1] .</p>
<p>In fact, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation process has been commercialized with the Catofin (Lummus) and Oleflex (UOP) technologies, which are based on CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively [3] ,[10] . The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles.</p>
<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] .</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure.</p>
<p>Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30] ,[31] .</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>
<p>Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures.</p>
<p>It is well-known that the presence of octahedrally coordinated Sn species at extra-framework position in the zeolites gives two correlated peaks at 486.0 and 494.4 eV, derived from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of octahedral Sn species [57] ,[58] . This signal is not observable in these Sn-Beta zeolites, which strongly suggests that there is no extra-framework Sn species in the Sn-Beta zeolites.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites [61] .</p>
<p>Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction [65] .</p>
<p>Further kinetic studies were performed on the optimized Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst at relatively low propane concentration with the conversion below 10%.</p>
<p>The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>It was previously proposed that both closed and open sites in zeolites may act as the active center for the reactions [66] . Herein the periodic DFT calculations were performed in Sn-Beta to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism and catalytic activity for the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Compared the overall enthalpy barriers in both direct and indirect pathways, we could conclude that the propane dehydrogenation proceeds via the direct pathway through primary C3H7 motif bonded with Sn at closed Lewis Sn-Beta sites.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to enter and exit the catalyst matrix. They improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering a larger surface area for reactions, better control over pore size and shape, and improved mass transfer rates.

2. Main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with a combination of zeolite layers and microporous materials, zeolites with templated mesopores, and zeolites with macrochannels. Synthesis methods typically involve the use of mesoporous materials as templates, sol-gel processes, and post-synthesis modification techniques. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by optimizing pore size distribution, enhancing stability, and increasing surface area.

3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites can achieve higher propylene yields and selectivities, longer catalyst lifetimes, and better resistance to coke formation. They enable more efficient PDH reactions with reduced energy requirements and lower environmental impact.
