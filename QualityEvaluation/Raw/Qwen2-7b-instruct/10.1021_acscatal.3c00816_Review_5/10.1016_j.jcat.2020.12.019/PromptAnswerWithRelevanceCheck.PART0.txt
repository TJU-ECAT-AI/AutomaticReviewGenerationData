The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] . Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction [21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[27] . A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction, and in-situ characterization studies reveal that single-site Zn(II) ions located in the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction [22] ,[25] . The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 C with stable activity over 24  h for propane dehydrogenation. Calculations with hybrid density functional theory suggests a non-redox mechanism for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by Co2+ similar to the pathway of single-site Zn2+/SiO2 [27] . The mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites show much higher activity in propane dehydrogenation than their dinuclear silica-supported counterparts, and the propane dehydrogenation reaction requires the presence of Al-O-Ga bonds to promote heterolytic C-H bond activation [23] ,[24] .

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more accessible sites for reactants and products. The main types of these materials include single-site catalysts where metal species are incorporated into zeolite frameworks, creating isolated metal sites that can act as active centers for reactions. Synthesis methods involve loading metal species onto metal oxides like SiO2 and Al2O3. These isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in PDH reactions, achieving a high selectivity of over 95% in silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalysts. In-situ characterization studies show that single-site Zn(II) ions located in strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Other single-site catalysts, such as Co2+ on SiO2 and mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites, also exhibit high selectivity and stability. Hybrid density functional theory calculations suggest non-redox mechanisms for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by these metal sites similar to those of single-site Zn2+/SiO2.

这些材料的主要类型包括将金属物种集成到沸石框架中的单个站点催化剂，通过这种方式可以形成孤立的金属位点作为反应的活性中心。合成方法涉及在金属氧化物如SiO2和Al2O3上加载金属物种。这些孤立的金属氧化物物种在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高性能，实现了在硅胶支持的单个站点Zn(II)催化剂中超过95％的选择性。原位表征研究表明，位于无定形硅胶表面受拉三元环中的单个站点Zn(II)离子是丙烷脱氢反应的活性位点。其他单个站点催化剂，如SiO2上的Co2+和单核铝基单个站点Ga位点，也表现出高选择性和稳定性。杂化密度泛函理论计算表明，这些金属位点用于激活C-H和H-H键的非还原机制与单个站点Zn2+/SiO2类似。

The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30] ,[31] . As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] .

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing multiple pathways for reactants and products to diffuse through the material, increasing the surface area for interactions, and potentially reducing diffusion limitations. The main types of these materials are typically categorized by their pore size distribution, such as mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which offer a combination of high surface areas and larger pore sizes compared to traditional microporous zeolites. Synthesis methods for these materials often involve template-directed processes, sol-gel routes, and calcination treatments to control pore size and structure. These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating better contact between reactants and catalyst sites, reducing energy barriers for reactions, and enhancing product selectivity.

2. The synthesis of Sn-Beta catalysts involves a two-step post-synthesis procedure: first, dealumination of the parent H-Beta zeolite using a high concentration of HNO3 to remove aluminum atoms and create lattice defects, and then incorporation of Sn species into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite. This indirect synthesis route is effective in removing aluminum atoms efficiently and preserving the zeolite's textural properties.

3. Theoretical calculations in Sn-Beta zeolite demonstrate that the direct pathway for propane dehydrogenation is more favorable than the indirect pathway, especially in open Sn(OH)2 sites. Open sites seem to be more reactive than closed ones due to their flexibility and ability to form hydrogen bonds with adjacent silanol nests, which can stabilize intermediates and facilitate reactions.

1. 层级沸石通过提供多种路径来增加反应物和产物通过材料的扩散途径，增强PDH反应的可接近性，同时通过提高表面积促进相互作用并可能降低扩散限制。这些材料的主要类型通常根据其孔径大小分布进行分类，如介孔和大孔沸石，它们与传统微孔沸石相比提供了较高的表面积和更大的孔径。层级沸石的合成方法通常涉及模板导向过程、溶胶-凝胶路线以及煅烧处理以控制孔径大小和结构。这些层级沸石通过提高催化剂位点与反应物的接触、降低反应势垒并增强产品选择性来改善PDH反应性能。

2. Sn-Beta催化剂的合成涉及两步后合成程序：首先，使用高浓度的硝酸处理母体H-Beta沸石以去除铝原子并产生晶格缺陷，然后将Sn物种注入空位中形成含Sn沸石。这种间接合成途径有效地高效地移除了铝原子并保留了沸石的纹理特性。

3. 在Sn-Beta沸石中进行的理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢直接路径比间接路径更为有利，尤其是在开放的Sn(OH)2位点上。开放位点似乎比封闭位点更具有活性，因为它们可以形成与相邻硅醇巢之间的氢键，稳定中间体并促进反应。

<p>Propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by single Lewis acid site in Sn-Beta zeolite Highlights • Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites is able to activate C-H bond. • Sn-Beta zeolite exhibits high performance in propane dehydrogenation. • Theoretical calculation suggest that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites.</p>

<p>Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures.</p>
<p>It is well-known that the presence of octahedrally coordinated Sn species at extra-framework position in the zeolites gives two correlated peaks at 486.0 and 494.4 eV, derived from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of octahedral Sn species [57] ,[58] . This signal is not observable in these Sn-Beta zeolites, which strongly suggests that there is no extra-framework Sn species in the Sn-Beta zeolites.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites [61] .</p>
<p>Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction [65] .</p>
<p>Further kinetic studies were performed on the optimized Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst at relatively low propane concentration with the conversion below 10%.</p>
<p>The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>It was previously proposed that both closed and open sites in zeolites may act as the active center for the reactions [66] . Herein the periodic DFT calculations were performed in Sn-Beta to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism and catalytic activity for the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Compared the overall enthalpy barriers in both direct and indirect pathways, we could conclude that the propane dehydrogenation proceeds via the direct pathway through primary C3H7 motif bonded with Sn at closed Lewis Sn-Beta sites.</p>
