[1] "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."
[2] "The reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates."
[3] "Specifically, the ZSM-5 (1.0) sample (treating parent ZSM-5 with 1 M NaOH) possesses a surface area of 406 m2·g1 and pore volume of 0.41 cm3·g1, which are much larger than those of the parent ZSM-5 (257 m2·g1 and 0.15 cm3·g1 respectively)."
[4] "The self-assembly is another efficient strategy to build hierarchical zeolites, which can be achieved via enwrapping zeolite crystals with the OMS through stepwise synthesis."
[5] "Under a high propane WHSV of 11 h1 (no diluted gas), the optimized Pt3La intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit an initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion), and the conversion remains >8% after 30 days of reaction."
[6] "After optimizing the Pt and Y loadings, the PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability with an initial propane conversion of 45% that lasted for 30 days."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores or macropores to enhance micropore accessibility without losing the confinement effect. They are synthesized through desilication, self-assembly, or using bifunctional surfactants and TPAOH and TBPOH as co-templates. Treatment of parent ZSM-5 with 1 M NaOH produces a sample with a surface area of 406 m²/g and pore volume of 0.41 cm³/g, significantly larger than the parent ZSM-5. Self-assembly is an efficient method for constructing hierarchical zeolites by enveloping zeolite crystals with OMS through stepwise synthesis. Optimized Pt3La intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit a high initial propane conversion of 40%, with a stable conversion above 8% after 30 days of reaction. After optimizing the Pt and Y loadings, the PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst maintains an initial propane conversion of 45% for 30 days.

层次状沸石结合微孔和介孔或大孔，以增强微孔可访问性而不牺牲内在的限制效应。它们通过脱硅、自组装或使用TPAOH和TBPOH作为共模板合成。将母体ZSM-5用1 M NaOH处理后，样品的比表面积达到406 m²/g，孔体积为0.41 cm³/g，远大于母体ZSM-5。通过逐步合成方法将沸石晶体包覆在OMS中实现自组装，是一种构建层次状沸石的有效策略。优化后的Pt3La金属间合金在层次状沸石上的初始丙烷转化率高达40%，反应30天后转化率仍超过8%。在优化Pt和Y负载后，PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br催化剂维持初始丙烷转化率为45%，持续30天。
