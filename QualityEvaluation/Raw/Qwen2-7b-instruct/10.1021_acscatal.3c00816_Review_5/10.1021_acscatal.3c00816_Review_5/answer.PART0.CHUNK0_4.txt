4. "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."
"Wang et al. (58) reported the construction of a hierarchical structure on commercial ZSM-5 zeolites through the desilication method."
"Li et al. (63) synthesized a series of TS-1@SBA-16 composites by adding as-synthesized TS-1 crystals to the synthesis precursor of SBA-16 materials."
"Ryoo (38) developed [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as a micro-/mesoporous dual-functional structure-directing agent, leading to the formation of hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites."
"It is noted that the PtY on hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites show a superior catalytic lifetime than the counterparts with the above-mentioned deGa hierarchical supports, which can be attributed to the higher silanol concentration in former cases."
"In comparison, the propane conversion was 22% and soon dropped to below 5% within 1.5 h on the microporous MFI catalyst with the same Pt/La loadings (Figure 7e)."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores or macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. They achieve this without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect of micropores. Desilication methods, self-assembly, and using bifunctional surfactants are common synthesis techniques. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by providing enhanced micropore accessibility, increasing surface areas, and strengthening metal-support interactions. The presence of abundant silanols facilitates the formation of intermetallic alloys, which contributes to superior catalytic stability. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites often exhibit higher initial propane conversions and propylene selectivities, as well as better catalytic lifetimes.

层状沸石结合微孔与介孔或大孔，以增强PDH反应过程中的可访问性。它们在不牺牲微孔固有的限制效应的情况下实现这一目标。脱硅方法、自组装和使用双功能表面活性剂是常见的合成技术。这些材料通过提供增强的微孔可访问性、增加表面积和加强金属-支持相互作用来改善PDH反应性能。丰富的硅醇的存在有助于单原子稀有地球物种的形成，这促进了Pt稀有地球合金的产生，从而贡献于更优秀的催化稳定性。与传统沸石相比，层状沸石往往具有更高的初始丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，以及更好的催化剂寿命。
