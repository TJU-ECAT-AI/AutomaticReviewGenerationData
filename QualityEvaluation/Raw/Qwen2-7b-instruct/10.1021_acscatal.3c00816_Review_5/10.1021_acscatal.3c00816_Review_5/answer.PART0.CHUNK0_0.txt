[1] "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."
[2] "For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates (Figure 7ac)."
[3] "Wang et al. (58) reported the construction of a hierarchical structure on commercial ZSM-5 zeolites through the desilication method."
[4] "Specifically, the ZSM-5 (1.0) sample (treating parent ZSM-5 with 1 M NaOH) possesses a surface area of 406 m2·g1 and pore volume of 0.41 cm3·g1, which are much larger than those of the parent ZSM-5 (257 m2·g1 and 0.15 cm3·g1 respectively)."
[5] "The self-assembly is another efficient strategy to build hierarchical zeolites, which can be achieved via enwrapping zeolite crystals with the OMS through stepwise synthesis."
[6] "Compared to Pt-SnOx/TS-1, the hierarchical Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 possesses a higher surface area and weaker acidity, thus greatly improving the stability of the catalyst."
[7] "Ryoo (38) developed [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as a micro-/mesoporous dual-functional structure-directing agent, leading to the formation of hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites."
[8] "The post degallation (deGa) process produces purely siliceous hierarchical MFI zeolites with abundant silanol nests."
[9] "The silanol nests allow the rare-earth elements (La, Ce, and Y) to exist as high-chemical potential single-atom species, which can diffuse onto Pt species to produce the Pt-rare earth intermetallic alloys during thermal treatment."
[10] "After optimizing the Pt and Y loadings, the PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability with an initial propane conversion of 45% that lasted for 30 days."
[11] "Pan et al. (146) reported the synthesis of hierarchical TS-1 zeolites assembled by ultrathin ( 3 nm) nanosheets using hexanediamine and [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as cotemplates."

[13] "Ji et al. (62) reported the incorporation of Fe species within S-1 framework can lead to a hierarchical-like morphology for the Fe-S-1 catalyst."
[14] "Choi et al. (111) synthesized the hierarchical gallosilicate MFI zeolites via a one-pot hydrothermal method using 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) and TPAOH as mesoporous and microporous templates, respectively."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores by incorporating an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network into the intrinsic zeolite micropores. This allows for enhanced micropore accessibility without losing the confinement effect provided by the micropores. They are synthesized through various methods, including desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactant synthesis, and pillared zeolite synthesis using specific templates.

2. The performance of PDH reactions is improved through hierarchical zeolites by enhancing micropore accessibility, which facilitates better access to the micropores where the PDH reactions occur. This results in higher conversion rates and propylene selectivity. The use of mesopores/macropores also aids in the diffusion of reactants and products, reducing diffusion limitations.

3. The introduction of mesoporous/macroporous networks into zeolites is achieved through desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactant synthesis, and pillared zeolite synthesis. These methods allow for the creation of hierarchical structures that maintain the intrinsic microporosity of zeolites while providing additional mesopore or macropore spaces. This results in catalysts with improved micropore accessibility, higher surface areas, and weaker acidity, contributing to enhanced PDH reaction performance.

4. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites often involves the use of special agents, such as [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2, which act as structure-directing agents to create dual-functional micro/mesoporous materials. These agents enable the formation of hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites with abundant silanol nests, facilitating the formation of Pt-rare earth intermetallic alloys during thermal treatment. This results in catalysts with improved stability and PDH performance.

5. Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by providing a balance between micropore confinement and mesopore/macropore diffusion. The enhanced micropore accessibility allows for more effective utilization of the confined space for PDH reactions, while the mesopore/macropore structure facilitates better reactant and product diffusion. This combination leads to higher conversion rates, improved propylene selectivity, and increased catalytic lifetime compared to traditional zeolites.
