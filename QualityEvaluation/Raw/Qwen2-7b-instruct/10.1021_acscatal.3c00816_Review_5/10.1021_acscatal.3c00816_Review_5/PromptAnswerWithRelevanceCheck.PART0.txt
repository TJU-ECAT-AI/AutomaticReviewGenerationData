1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores by incorporating an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network into the intrinsic zeolite micropores. This allows for enhanced micropore accessibility without losing the confinement effect provided by the micropores. They are synthesized through various methods, including desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactant synthesis, and pillared zeolite synthesis using specific templates.

2. The performance of PDH reactions is improved through hierarchical zeolites by enhancing micropore accessibility, which facilitates better access to the micropores where the PDH reactions occur. This results in higher conversion rates and propylene selectivity. The use of mesopores/macropores also aids in the diffusion of reactants and products, reducing diffusion limitations.

3. The introduction of mesoporous/macroporous networks into zeolites is achieved through desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactant synthesis, and pillared zeolite synthesis. These methods allow for the creation of hierarchical structures that maintain the intrinsic microporosity of zeolites while providing additional mesopore or macropore spaces. This results in catalysts with improved micropore accessibility, higher surface areas, and weaker acidity, contributing to enhanced PDH reaction performance.

4. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites often involves the use of special agents, such as [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2, which act as structure-directing agents to create dual-functional micro/mesoporous materials. These agents enable the formation of hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites with abundant silanol nests, facilitating the formation of Pt-rare earth intermetallic alloys during thermal treatment. This results in catalysts with improved stability and PDH performance.

5. Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by providing a balance between micropore confinement and mesopore/macropore diffusion. The enhanced micropore accessibility allows for more effective utilization of the confined space for PDH reactions, while the mesopore/macropore structure facilitates better reactant and product diffusion. This combination leads to higher conversion rates, improved propylene selectivity, and increased catalytic lifetime compared to traditional zeolites.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a network that allows for better access to the micropores without losing the confinement effect provided by the micropores. They are synthesized through various methods including desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactants, and pillaring. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by increasing surface area and pore volume, enhancing micropore accessibility, and strengthening metal-support interactions. For instance, treating ZSM-5 with NaOH increases its surface area and pore volume, resulting in higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Hierarchical zeolites also incorporate single atom rare-earth species, which form intermetallic alloys with Pt, enhancing stability and performance. Additionally, the presence of silanol nests facilitates the formation of Pt-rare earth alloys, contributing to improved PDH performance. Furthermore, hierarchical zeolites with layered nanosheet structures have a larger external surface area, which leads to enhanced metal-support interactions and catalyst stability. Despite advancements, diffusion limitations in certain zeolite structures still pose challenges, necessitating careful examination of activity and selectivity. The combination of fast diffusion in mesopores and confinement in micropores in hierarchical zeolites provides a viable pathway to construct efficient PDH catalysts. Researchers have successfully developed Pt-hierarchical zeolite catalysts that exhibit impressive propylene selectivity and catalytic lifetime. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of Pt-free catalysts for PDH reactions.
