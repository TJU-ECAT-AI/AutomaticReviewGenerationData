[1] "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."
[2] "For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates (Figure 7ac)."
[3] "Specifically, the ZSM-5 (1.0) sample (treating parent ZSM-5 with 1 M NaOH) possesses a surface area of 406 m2·g1 and pore volume of 0.41 cm3·g1, which are much larger than those of the parent ZSM-5 (257 m2·g1 and 0.15 cm3·g1 respectively)."
[4] "Under the same testing conditions, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 exhibits an initial propane conversion of 50% and propylene selectivity of 95%, which are much higher than those of the counterpart with parent microporous ZSM-5 (30% propane conversion and 65% propylene selectivity)."
[5] "The post degallation (deGa) process produces purely siliceous hierarchical MFI zeolites with abundant silanol nests."
[6] "The silanol nests allow the rare-earth elements (La, Ce, and Y) to exist as high-chemical potential single-atom species, which can diffuse onto Pt species to produce the Pt-rare earth intermetallic alloys during thermal treatment."
[7] "In comparison, the propane conversion was 22% and soon dropped to below 5% within 1.5 h on the microporous MFI catalyst with the same Pt/La loadings (Figure 7e)."
[8] "This work highlights the effect of silanol nests on the formation of single atom rare-earth species, which is the key to producing Pt-rare earth alloys."
[9] "The optimized PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability with an initial propane conversion of 45% that lasted for 30 days."
[10] "Moreover, the TS-1 nanosheets are rich in external (isolated) Si-OH/Ti-OH groups instead of internal (confined) Si-OH/Ti-OH species in conventional bulk zeolites, which contributes to weaker acidity."
[11] "The time-resolved 2,3-dimethylpyridine (DMPyr)-DRIFT experiments indicate a faster diffusion efficiency on hierarchical-like catalysts than bulk counterparts."
[12] "The optimized Pt/Fe-3 catalyst obtains a propane conversion of 39.2% and a propylene selectivity of 96.2% with using undiluted propane reactants and a high propane WSHV of 17 h1, and no obvious deactivation was detected after 3 days reaction."
[13] "The hierarchical S-1 zeolites possess higher surface silanols compared to their bulk counterparts, which effectively enhances the metalsupport interactions."
[14] "The as-obtained catalyst contains a layered nanosheet structure, leading to a large external surface area with an increased number of isolated silanols."
[15] "In this context, although several FAU and CHA topologic zeolite-based materials were developed for the PDH reaction, (57,108,109) the diffusion limitations and their effect on activity/selectivity should be carefully checked."
[16] "The hierarchical zeolites combine the advantages of fast diffusion of mesopores and the confinement of micropores, which provides a viable pathway to construct efficient PDH catalysts."
[17] "Researchers have developed a set of promising Pt-hierarchical zeolite catalysts which obtain impressive propylene selectivity and catalytic lifetime at thermodynamic conversion."
[18] "In the past decade, there is a significant progress of the Pt-free catalysts in PDH performance."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a network that allows for better access to the micropores without losing the confinement effect provided by the micropores. They are synthesized through various methods including desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactants, and pillaring. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by increasing surface area and pore volume, enhancing micropore accessibility, and strengthening metal-support interactions. For instance, treating ZSM-5 with NaOH increases its surface area and pore volume, resulting in higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Hierarchical zeolites also incorporate single atom rare-earth species, which form intermetallic alloys with Pt, enhancing stability and performance. Additionally, the presence of silanol nests facilitates the formation of Pt-rare earth alloys, contributing to improved PDH performance. Furthermore, hierarchical zeolites with layered nanosheet structures have a larger external surface area, which leads to enhanced metal-support interactions and catalyst stability. Despite advancements, diffusion limitations in certain zeolite structures still pose challenges, necessitating careful examination of activity and selectivity. The combination of fast diffusion in mesopores and confinement in micropores in hierarchical zeolites provides a viable pathway to construct efficient PDH catalysts. Researchers have successfully developed Pt-hierarchical zeolite catalysts that exhibit impressive propylene selectivity and catalytic lifetime. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of Pt-free catalysts for PDH reactions.

层状沸石通过提供一个网络，使得微孔具有更好的可达性，同时不失去由微孔提供的约束效应，从而结合了微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应中的可访问性。它们通过多种方法进行合成，包括脱硅、自组装、双功能表面活性剂和层间插入。与传统沸石相比，层状沸石通过增加表面积和孔体积、增强微孔可达性和加强金属-支撑相互作用来提高PDH反应性能。例如，通过NaOH处理ZSM-5可以增加其表面积和孔体积，从而导致更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。层状沸石还整合了单原子稀土物种，这些物种与Pt形成合金，提高了稳定性并增强了性能。此外，硅醇巢的存在促进了Pt-Rare Earth合金的形成，从而有助于提高PDH性能。另外，具有层状纳米片结构的层状沸石具有更大的外部表面积，这导致增强的金属-支撑相互作用和催化剂稳定性。尽管取得了进展，但在某些沸石结构中仍然存在扩散限制问题，需要仔细检查活性和选择性。层状沸石结合了介孔的快速扩散和微孔的约束，提供了构建高效PDH催化剂的有效途径。研究人员已经成功开发出Pt层状沸石催化剂，表现出令人印象深刻的丙烯选择性和催化寿命。近年来，在无Pt催化剂PDH反应性能的发展方面取得了显著进步。
