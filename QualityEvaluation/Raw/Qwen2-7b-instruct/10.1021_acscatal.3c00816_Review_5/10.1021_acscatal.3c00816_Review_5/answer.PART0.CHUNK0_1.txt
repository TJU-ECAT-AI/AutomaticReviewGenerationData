4. Metal-Hierarchical Zeolite Materials
"ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."
"Wang et al. (58) reported the construction of a hierarchical structure on commercial ZSM-5 zeolites through the desilication method."
"Specifically, the ZSM-5 (1.0) sample (treating parent ZSM-5 with 1 M NaOH) possesses a surface area of 406 m2·g1 and pore volume of 0.41 cm3·g1, which are much larger than those of the parent ZSM-5 (257 m2·g1 and 0.15 cm3·g1 respectively)."
"Ryoo (38) developed [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as a micro-/mesoporous dual-functional structure-directing agent, leading to the formation of hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites."
"It is noted that the PtY on hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites show a superior catalytic lifetime than the counterparts with the above-mentioned deGa hierarchical supports, which can be attributed to the higher silanol concentration in former cases."
"Pan et al. (146) reported the synthesis of hierarchical TS-1 zeolites assembled by ultrathin ( 3 nm) nanosheets using hexanediamine and [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as cotemplates."
"Zhang et al. (61) designed a novel fin zeolite by using TPAOH and 1,8-diaminooctane as dual-templates."
"Qin et al. (147) compared the effect of different synthesis procedures (top-down and bottom-up) on the physicochemical properties of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites."

Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, enhancing micropore accessibility without sacrificing the confinement effect. They are synthesized using various methods, such as desilication, self-assembly, and hydrothermal synthesis. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by increasing surface area, pore volume, and acidity, leading to better dispersion and electron density over metal sites, and facilitating the formation of intermetallic compounds. They exhibit superior catalytic lifetime and activity, especially in the presence of strong Lewis and Bronsted acid sites.

分级沸石结合了沸石固有的微孔和辅助的介孔/大孔网络，提高了微孔的可访问性，同时不牺牲内在的限制效应。它们通过多种方法合成，如脱硅、自组装和水热合成。这些材料通过增加表面积、孔体积和酸性，改善了金属位点的分散性和电子密度，促进了络合物的形成，从而提高了PDH反应的性能。它们表现出优越的催化寿命和活性，尤其是在强路易斯酸和伯仲酸位点的存在下。
