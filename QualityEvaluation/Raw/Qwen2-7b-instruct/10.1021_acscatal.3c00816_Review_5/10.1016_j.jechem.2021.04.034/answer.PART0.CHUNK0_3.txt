1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve the accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials often include various types such as zeolites, molecular sieves, and metal-organic frameworks. The synthesis methods typically involve hydrothermal routes, incipient wetness impregnation, and sol-gel processes. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer enhanced surface area, improved pore connectivity, and better catalytic performance due to their multifunctional structure and tailored pore sizes.

2. The main objectives of this research are to ascertain the applicability of zinc-containing zeolite catalysts in commercial PDH processes and to pinpoint the active zinc sites involved in the reaction. The study aims to resolve existing discrepancies regarding zinc-based PDH catalysts and to understand the role of zinc sites in alkane activation processes.

3. Under optimized conditions, the Zn@S-1 catalyst achieves a propylene spacetime yield (STY) of 24 and a selectivity of 97% at 853 K, showcasing its significant potential for industrial PDH applications.

4. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. This structural feature allows for better control over the diffusion of reactants and products, thereby improving the efficiency of the PDH process.
