2.1. "Synthesis of S-1 zeolite S-1 zeolite was synthesized via conventional hydrothermal route."
2.2. "The Zn-x@S-1 zeolites with different zinc loadings were synthesized via similar hydrothermal route described above, and the zinc precursor [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](OAc)2 was added the during the process."
2.3. "Typically, 1 g of S-1 zeolite host was impregnated with 0.14 g of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O in 40 mL H2O, and dried at 353 K to achieve an intimate mixture powder."

Hierarchical zeolites, such as S-1, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactants to interact with the catalyst. The synthesis involves a hydrothermal route, which allows for the controlled formation of these pores. In the case of S-1 zeolites, the synthesis includes adding a zinc precursor to create Zn@S-1 catalysts, which are characterized by isolated zinc cations trapped by the zeolite's Si-OH groups. This unique structure improves PDH reaction performance by optimizing the interaction between the reactants and the active zinc sites, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability compared to traditional zeolites.

层级型沸石，如S-1，通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而提供更大的表面面积供反应物与催化剂相互作用。合成过程采用水热法，允许形成这些孔隙。对于S-1沸石来说，合成过程包括添加锌前体以产生Zn@S-1催化剂，其中孤立的锌离子被沸石的Si-OH基团捕获。这种独特的结构通过优化反应物与活性锌位点的相互作用，提高PDH反应性能，从而实现良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和再生能力，与传统沸石相比有显著提升。
