[1] "A series of Zn-containing zeolites with different zinc loadings, namely Zn@S-1, have been successfully prepared via ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route."
[2] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components."
[3] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been optimized. Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction."
[4] "TPSR and co-feeding experiments indicate the two-step activation of propane on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction."
[5] "In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction."

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for active sites. These materials are synthesized through a ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route, which allows for the trapping and stabilization of isolated zinc cations within the zeolite structure. Compared to traditional zeolites, Zn@S-1 zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their optimized catalyst composition and parameters. The two-step activation of propane occurs on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species (where 0 < δ < 2) are identified as the preferred active sites for PDH reactions.

层次型沸石，通过结合微孔、介孔和大孔，提高了PDH反应的可接近性，提供了更多供活性位点使用的表面积。这些材料通过配体保护直接水热合成法合成，允许在沸石结构中捕获并稳定孤立的锌离子。与传统沸石相比，Zn@S-1沸石在PDH反应中表现出更优性能，得益于其优化的催化剂组成和参数。丙烷的两步激活发生在锌位点上，通过氢抽象进行，部分还原的Znδ+物种（其中0 < δ < 2）被识别为PDH反应的优选活性位点。
