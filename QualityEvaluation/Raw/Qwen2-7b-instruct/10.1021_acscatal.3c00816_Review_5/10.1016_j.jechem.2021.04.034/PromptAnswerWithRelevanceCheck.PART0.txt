2.1. "Synthesis of S-1 zeolite S-1 zeolite was synthesized via conventional hydrothermal route."
2.2. "The Zn-x@S-1 zeolites with different zinc loadings were synthesized via similar hydrothermal route described above, and the zinc precursor [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](OAc)2 was added the during the process."
2.3. "Typically, 1 g of S-1 zeolite host was impregnated with 0.14 g of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O in 40 mL H2O, and dried at 353 K to achieve an intimate mixture powder."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites, such as S-1, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactants to interact with the catalyst. The synthesis involves a hydrothermal route, which allows for the controlled formation of these pores. In the case of S-1 zeolites, the synthesis includes adding a zinc precursor to create Zn@S-1 catalysts, which are characterized by isolated zinc cations trapped by the zeolite's Si-OH groups. This unique structure improves PDH reaction performance by optimizing the interaction between the reactants and the active zinc sites, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability compared to traditional zeolites.

层级型沸石，如S-1，通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而提供更大的表面面积供反应物与催化剂相互作用。合成过程采用水热法，允许形成这些孔隙。对于S-1沸石来说，合成过程包括添加锌前体以产生Zn@S-1催化剂，其中孤立的锌离子被沸石的Si-OH基团捕获。这种独特的结构通过优化反应物与活性锌位点的相互作用，提高PDH反应性能，从而实现良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和再生能力，与传统沸石相比有显著提升。

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for active sites. These materials are synthesized through a ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route, which allows for the trapping and stabilization of isolated zinc cations within the zeolite structure. Compared to traditional zeolites, Zn@S-1 zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their optimized catalyst composition and parameters. The two-step activation of propane occurs on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species (where 0 < δ < 2) are identified as the preferred active sites for PDH reactions.

层次型沸石，通过结合微孔、介孔和大孔，提高了PDH反应的可接近性，提供了更多供活性位点使用的表面积。这些材料通过配体保护直接水热合成法合成，允许在沸石结构中捕获并稳定孤立的锌离子。与传统沸石相比，Zn@S-1沸石在PDH反应中表现出更优性能，得益于其优化的催化剂组成和参数。丙烷的两步激活发生在锌位点上，通过氢抽象进行，部分还原的Znδ+物种（其中0 < δ < 2）被识别为PDH反应的优选活性位点。
