1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types include MFI, MEL, BEA, and ZSM-5. These materials are synthesized through sol-gel processes, hydrothermal treatments, and template-directed synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show better catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability due to their enhanced pore structure.
