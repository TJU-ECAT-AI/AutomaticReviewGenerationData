Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a large surface area and ordered pore structure. This allows for efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. The synthesis methods include a facile one-pot hydrothermal method and impregnation. The one-pot method provides a more stable mesoporous structure and better distribution of magnesium species. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by modifying the structural characteristics of the metallic phase, strengthening interactions between platinum, tin species, and the support, and facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits from active metals to the support surface. This results in enhanced selectivity and stability of the catalysts, particularly when magnesium is added in an appropriate amount. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 sample shows the best catalytic activity with 43.0% propane conversion and 99% propene selectivity.

<p>As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield.</p>
<p>The acidity on the PtSn catalyst hinders the desorption of olefins product and extend the retention time on catalyst surface, leading to the further conversion and carbon deposition due to secondary dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions.</p>
<p>A series of high-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 (xMg-SBA-15, x = 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) was prepared using a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reactants and products, facilitating faster diffusion rates. The main types of these materials include mesoporous zeolites, templated zeolites, and mesoporous molecular sieves. Synthesis methods typically involve hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel processing, and ion-exchange methods. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size, and improved catalytic site distribution, which leads to higher activity and selectivity. This is evidenced by the superior catalytic activity and stability observed in the Mg-incorporated SBA-15 materials, especially the PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt.% magnesium, which showed a higher than 98% selectivity toward propene even after 6 hours of reaction.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and interconnected pore system that allows for efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials are mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized using hydrothermal or sol-gel methods. They improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering higher surface areas and better porosity, which leads to faster reaction rates and improved selectivity. The synthesis of these materials often involves the incorporation of alkaline metals or earth metals, which can be introduced through the post-synthesis procedure. This can influence the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic properties of the materials, particularly in terms of their surface area, porosity, and reactivity.

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more open channels for reactants and products. Main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized using template-directed methods. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the risk of coking, and improving catalyst stability.

2. The synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites typically involve the use of templates, such as block copolymers, to control the pore structure and size during the synthesis process. The templates ensure the formation of well-defined and ordered mesoporous or macroporous structures within the zeolite framework.

3. The improvement in PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites is attributed to several factors. Hierarchical zeolites offer a combination of high surface area, controlled pore sizes, and well-defined pore geometries, which optimize the adsorption and diffusion of reactants. Additionally, the presence of mesopores and macropores enhances the accessibility of the active sites, reduces the likelihood of coke formation, and improves the overall stability of the catalyst under PDH reaction conditions. The synthesis methods also allow for precise control over the catalyst's properties, enabling the optimization of its performance for specific reaction conditions.

4. The hierarchical zeolites achieve these enhancements by providing a more efficient pathway for reactant molecules to reach the active sites while minimizing the risk of unwanted side reactions. The larger pore sizes facilitate easier access to the interior of the zeolite crystals, allowing for faster and more efficient transport of reactants and products. Furthermore, the well-defined pore structures minimize the formation of byproducts, particularly coke, which can deactivate the catalyst over time. By controlling the synthesis parameters, researchers can tailor the zeolite's properties to match the specific requirements of PDH reactions, thereby maximizing its catalytic efficiency and longevity.

2. 分级沸石的合成方法通常涉及使用模板（如嵌段共聚物）来控制孔结构和尺寸。模板确保在合成过程中形成有序的介孔或大孔结构。

3. 与传统沸石相比，分级沸石在PDH反应中的性能提升主要归功于以下几个方面：（1）高表面积提供了更多的活性位点；（2）精确控制的孔径大小和孔隙几何形状优化了反应物和产物的吸附与扩散；（3）大孔的存在增强了反应物到达活性位点的效率，同时减少了不希望的副反应风险。通过调整合成参数，研究人员可以根据特定的反应条件定制沸石的性质，以最大化其催化效率和使用寿命。

4. 分级沸石通过提供更有效的路径来优化反应物到达活性位点的途径，同时最小化焦碳等副产品的形成，从而提高了PDH反应的性能。较大的孔径使得反应物更容易进入沸石晶体内部，从而实现更快和更高效的反应物和产物运输。此外，精确定义的孔结构减少了焦碳的形成，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。通过控制合成参数，可以定制沸石的特性以匹配PDH反应的具体需求，从而最大化其催化效率和寿命。

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more efficient pore structure. They achieve this through various synthesis methods, including the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve PDH reaction performance by optimizing the dispersion of catalysts, facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits, and enhancing the interactions between metal species and the support. Specifically, magnesium incorporation modifies the metallic phase, strengthens interactions, and promotes the migration of coke deposits from active metals to the support.
