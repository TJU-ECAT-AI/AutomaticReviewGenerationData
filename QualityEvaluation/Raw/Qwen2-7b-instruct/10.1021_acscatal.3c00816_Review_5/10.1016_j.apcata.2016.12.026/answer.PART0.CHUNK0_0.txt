Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a large surface area and ordered pore structure. This allows for efficient adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. The synthesis methods include a facile one-pot hydrothermal method and impregnation. The one-pot method provides a more stable mesoporous structure and better distribution of magnesium species. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by modifying the structural characteristics of the metallic phase, strengthening interactions between platinum, tin species, and the support, and facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits from active metals to the support surface. This results in enhanced selectivity and stability of the catalysts, particularly when magnesium is added in an appropriate amount. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 sample shows the best catalytic activity with 43.0% propane conversion and 99% propene selectivity.

层状沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供大量表面和有序孔结构来增强PDH反应的可访问性。这允许有效吸附和扩散反应物和产物。合成方法包括简便的一锅法水热法和浸渍法。一锅法提供了更稳定的介孔结构和更好的镁物种分布。这些材料通过修改金属相的结构特征、加强铂、锡物种与支撑之间的相互作用以及促进碳沉积从活性金属转移到支撑表面，从而提高了PDH反应性能。这导致催化剂的增强选择性和稳定性，特别是当添加适当的镁时。2Mg-SBA-15样品显示最佳催化活性，丙烷转化率为43.0%，丙烯选择性为99%。
