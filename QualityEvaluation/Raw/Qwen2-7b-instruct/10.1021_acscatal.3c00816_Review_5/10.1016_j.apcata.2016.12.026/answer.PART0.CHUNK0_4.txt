[1] "High-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 (xMg-SBA-15, x = 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) was prepared using a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method."
[2] "These materials were further used as PtSn catalyst supports for propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "It was found that incorporation of appropriate amount of Mg modified the structural characteristics of the metallic phase and strengthened the interactions between platinum, tin species and support."
[4] "Meanwhile, the presence of magnesium facilitated the transfer of the carbon deposits from the active metal to the support surface."
[5] "In our experiment, the PtSn catalysts with 14 wt.% Mg dopant exhibited better catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation than PtSn/SBA-15 sample."
[6] "The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 sample with 2 wt.% Mg synthesized by one-pot method showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a propane conversion of 43.0% and a propene selectivity of 99%."

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more efficient pore structure. They achieve this through various synthesis methods, including the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials improve PDH reaction performance by optimizing the dispersion of catalysts, facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits, and enhancing the interactions between metal species and the support. Specifically, magnesium incorporation modifies the metallic phase, strengthens interactions, and promotes the migration of coke deposits from active metals to the support. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst, synthesized via the one-pot method, exhibits superior catalytic activity with a high propane conversion and propene selectivity.

层次型沸石，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过提供更大的表面积和更有效的孔结构来增强PDH反应的可接近性。它们通过各种合成方法实现这一目标，包括一锅法水热合成。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过优化催化剂的分散、促进碳沉积物从活性金属向支撑表面转移以及增强金属物种与支撑的相互作用，提高了PDH反应性能。具体而言，镁的掺入修改了金属相，加强了相互作用，并促进了活性金属上碳沉积物向支撑表面的迁移。通过一锅法制备的PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15催化剂表现出优越的催化活性，具有高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
