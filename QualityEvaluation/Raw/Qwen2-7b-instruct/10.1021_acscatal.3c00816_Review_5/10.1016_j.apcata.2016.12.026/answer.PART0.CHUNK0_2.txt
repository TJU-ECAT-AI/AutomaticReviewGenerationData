[1] "A series of high-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 (xMg-SBA-15, x = 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) was prepared using a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method."
[2] "The physicochemical properties of the supports and catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, TEM, NH3-TPD, XPS, H2-TPD and TG-DTA techniques."
[3] "Compared with the sample synthesized by the impregnation method, the xMg-SBA-15 materials showed a better Mg species distribution and higher specific surface area."
[4] "The catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation method."
[5] "The introduction of alkaline metal and alkaline earth metal in the published literature was mostly loaded through the post-synthesis procedure."
[6] "This can provide us with important information to identify the influence of magnesium promoter on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic properties of PtSn/SBA-15 in the propane dehydrogenation."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and interconnected pore system that allows for efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The main types of these materials are mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, which are synthesized using hydrothermal or sol-gel methods. They improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering higher surface areas and better porosity, which leads to faster reaction rates and improved selectivity. The synthesis of these materials often involves the incorporation of alkaline metals or earth metals, which can be introduced through the post-synthesis procedure. This can influence the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic properties of the materials, particularly in terms of their surface area, porosity, and reactivity.

层次型沸石通过提供更大的表面积和连通孔隙系统，增强了PDH反应的可接近性，从而提高了反应效率和选择性。这些材料的主要类型是介孔和大孔沸石，它们通过水热合成或溶胶-凝胶法合成。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供更高的表面积和更好的孔隙性，可以显著提高PDH反应性能。合成这些材料时通常会引入碱土金属或地球金属，这可以通过后合成程序实现。这种引入方式可以影响材料的物理化学特性和催化性质，特别是其表面面积、孔隙性和活性。
