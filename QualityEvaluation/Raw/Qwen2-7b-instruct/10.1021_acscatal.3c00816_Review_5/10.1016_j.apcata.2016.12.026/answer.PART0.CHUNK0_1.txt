<p>As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield.</p>
<p>The acidity on the PtSn catalyst hinders the desorption of olefins product and extend the retention time on catalyst surface, leading to the further conversion and carbon deposition due to secondary dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions.</p>
<p>A series of high-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 (xMg-SBA-15, x = 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) was prepared using a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method.</p>
<p>The physicochemical properties of the supports and catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, TEM, NH3-TPD, XPS, H2-TPD and TG-DTA techniques.</p>
<p>It was found that incorporation of appropriate amounts of Mg promoted the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles and facilitated the transfer of the carbon deposits from the active metal to the support.</p>
<p>The best catalytic performances were obtained on PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt.% of magnesium, showing a higher than 98% selectivity toward propene at a 38.0% conversion of propane even after 6 h reaction.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for the reactants and products, facilitating faster diffusion rates. The main types of these materials include mesoporous zeolites, templated zeolites, and mesoporous molecular sieves. Synthesis methods typically involve hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel processing, and ion-exchange methods. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size, and improved catalytic site distribution, which leads to higher activity and selectivity. This is evidenced by the superior catalytic activity and stability observed in the Mg-incorporated SBA-15 materials, especially the PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt.% magnesium, which showed a higher than 98% selectivity toward propene even after 6 hours of reaction.

层级沸石结合微孔和介孔或大孔，通过提供更大的表面积来增强PDH反应的可接近性，从而加快反应物和产物的扩散速率。这些材料的主要类型包括介孔沸石、模板沸石和介孔分子筛。合成方法通常涉及水热合成、溶胶-凝胶处理和离子交换法。与传统沸石相比，层级沸石在PDH反应中表现出更优性能，主要得益于其增强的表面积、可控的孔径大小和改善的催化活性位点分布，这导致更高的活性和选择性。这在Mg掺杂SBA-15材料中得到了证明，尤其是含有2 wt.%镁的PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15催化剂，在6小时反应后仍能保持超过98%的丙烯选择性。
