Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. Main types include MFI, MEL, and BEA structures, synthesized through hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-assisted methods. These materials improve PDH reaction performance due to enhanced surface area, better pore structure, and controlled ZnOx speciation, resulting in higher activity and selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.
