1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. The key types of these materials are dealuminated zeolite beta, which can be produced via methods like ion-exchange, acid treatment, and dealumination. Compared to traditional zeolites, these materials enhance PDH reaction performance thanks to their superior surface area and pore structure.
