1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to improve the accessibility for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.
2. A key type of hierarchical zeolites is dealuminated zeolite beta.
3. Dealuminated zeolite beta can be synthesized via a process called dealumination.
4. Hierarchical zeolites outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reactions due to enhanced accessibility and more efficient use of active sites.

1. 级联沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的可接近性。
2. 级联沸石的主要类型包括去铝沸石β。
3. 去铝沸石β可以通过称为去铝化的过程进行合成。
4. 与传统沸石相比，级联沸石在PDH反应中的表现更优，这是由于增强了可接近性和活性位点的更高效利用。
