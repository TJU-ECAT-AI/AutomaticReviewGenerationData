Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The main types include dealuminated zeolite beta, mesoporous silica materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Dealuminated zeolite beta is synthesized through selective removal of aluminum atoms from the zeolite structure. Mesoporous silica materials are typically prepared using sol-gel chemistry or template-directed synthesis. Metal-organic frameworks are synthesized by coordinating metal ions with organic linkers under appropriate conditions. These materials improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and improved stability.
