Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The key types of hierarchical zeolites consist of dealuminated zeolite beta, synthesized via a process called dealumination. These materials outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reaction performance due to their enhanced surface area and more accessible pore structure.
