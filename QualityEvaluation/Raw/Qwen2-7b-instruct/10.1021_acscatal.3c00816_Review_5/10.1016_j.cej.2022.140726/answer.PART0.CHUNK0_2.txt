[1] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."
[2] "The effects of dealumination pretreatment on the BEA zeolite support are investigated with respect to structural property of Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites as well as the catalytic PDH performance."
[3] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst."
[4] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[5] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous and macroporous materials."
[6] "Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites involve template-directed assembly, sol-gel techniques, and ion-exchange processes."
[7] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better selectivity and stability."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and more pathways for reactants and products. This allows for improved selectivity and stability in PDH reactions.
2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites include mesoporous and macroporous materials, which are designed to have pores ranging from 2 to 50 nm and greater than 50 nm, respectively.
3. Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites involve template-directed assembly, sol-gel techniques, and ion-exchange processes, which allow for precise control over the pore structure and composition.
4. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better selectivity and stability, due to their enhanced pore structure and tailored surface chemistry.
