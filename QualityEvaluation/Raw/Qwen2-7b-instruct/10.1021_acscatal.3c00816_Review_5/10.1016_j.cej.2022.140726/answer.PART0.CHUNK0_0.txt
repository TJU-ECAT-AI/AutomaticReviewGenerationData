<p>The hierarchical zeolites are composed of interconnected 12-membered rings that provide a larger pore size compared to MFI-type zeolites, enhancing accessibility for PDH reactions.</p>
<p>The main types of hierarchical zeolites include BEA (Si/Al = 20) zeolite and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite. They are synthesized through dealumination treatment of commercial BEA samples followed by vacuum impregnation of Co(NO3)2·6H2O solutions.</p>
<p>These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by providing isolated Co2+ cations as active sites that selectively activate CH bonds of propane rather than dissociate CC bonds, resulting in high propylene selectivity and stability.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites, including BEA and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolites, are synthesized by treating commercial BEA samples with dealumination and then impregnating with Co(NO3)2·6H2O solutions. These zeolites feature interconnected 12-membered rings that offer larger pores than MFI-type zeolites, improving accessibility for PDH reactions. The isolated Co2+ cations, anchored in zeolite micropores, act as active sites that preferentially activate CH bonds over CC bonds in propane, leading to high propylene selectivity and stability in PDH reactions.

层状沸石，包括BEA和去铝硅沸石，通过处理商业BEA样品并用去铝处理，然后浸渍Co(NO3)2·6H2O溶液合成。这些沸石具有连接的十二元环结构，提供比MFI型沸石更大的孔隙，从而提高PDH反应的可接近性。锚定在沸石微孔中的孤立Co2+离子作为活性位点，优先活化丙烷中的CH键而不是裂解CC键，导致PDH反应中高丙烯选择性和稳定性。
