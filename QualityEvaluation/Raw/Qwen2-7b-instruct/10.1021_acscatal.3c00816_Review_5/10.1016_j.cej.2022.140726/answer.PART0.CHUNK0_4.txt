<p>Specifically, the post-treatment (e.g., dealumination) of zeolites can regulate the pore structure and acidic property and change the accommodation of various introduced metallic sites, determining the catalytic properties in the reactions</p>
<p>The dealumination treatment was effective. It also suggested that the incorporation of a small amount of Co species in the zeolites could not significantly affect the texture structure</p>
<p>Specifically, the d302 spacing values were estimated according to the position information of the peak at 22.6 (2θ), which were summarized in Table 1</p>
<p>Furthermore, Co@Si-BEA catalyst adsorbs propylene in a favorable configuration, leading to desired adsorption features with respect to less amount and weaker strength in comparison with that on non-dealuminated Co@BEA catalyst</p>
<p>By well tuning the structure of both these two kinds of sites via the dealumination treatment, desorption property of C3H6 intermediates could be significantly facilitated, and therefore the comprehensive catalytic performance (i.e., C3H6 selectivity, activity, anti-coking stability) could be promoted for Co@Si-BEA-catalyzed PDH reaction</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a network of pores of varying sizes. This allows for better diffusion and interaction of reactants and products. The main types include mesoporous and macroporous zeolites, often created through methods like template-assisted synthesis or sacrificial templating. These materials improve PDH reactions by increasing the surface area for reactions, enhancing adsorption and desorption properties, and promoting more efficient use of the active sites. 

2. The dealumination treatment of zeolites changes their pore structure and acidic properties, affecting the accommodation of metallic sites. This regulation determines the catalytic properties in reactions like PDH. The treatment does not significantly alter the texture structure of zeolites, suggesting it selectively modifies the pore environment.

3. The d302 spacing values in BEA zeolites are determined by the position of the peak at 22.6 (2θ). These values are used to estimate the spacing between layers in the zeolite structure, which affects the accessibility of the active sites for reactions.

4. The Co@Si-BEA catalyst shows improved propylene desorption properties compared to the non-dealuminated Co@BEA catalyst. This is because propylene chemisorbs on Co@Si-BEA in a favorable configuration, leading to less adsorption amount and weaker strength. This characteristic contributes to its high propylene selectivity, activity, and stability in PDH reactions.

5. By optimizing the structure of the Co sites and surface acid sites in the Co@Si-BEA catalyst through dealumination treatment, the desorption property of C3H6 intermediates is significantly enhanced. This leads to improved catalytic performance, including high propylene selectivity, activity, and anti-coking stability in PDH reactions.

1. 阶梯状沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强丙烷脱氢反应的可接近性，创建了不同大小孔径的网络。这允许更好地扩散和反应物与产物的相互作用。主要类型包括介孔和大孔沸石，通常通过模板辅助合成或牺牲模板法制备。这些材料通过增加反应表面面积、增强吸附和脱附性质以及更有效地利用活性位点，改善了PDH反应。

2. 沸石的去铝处理改变其孔结构和酸性性质，影响引入金属位点的容纳性。这种调节决定了反应（如PDH）的催化性能。处理不会显著改变沸石的纹理结构，表明它仅选择性地修改了孔环境。

3. BEA沸石中的d302间距值由22.6（2θ）处峰的位置决定。这些值用于估计层间在沸石结构中的间距，这影响了活性位点对反应的可达性。

4. Co@Si-BEA催化剂显示了与非去铝化Co@BEA催化剂相比改进的丙烯脱附特性。这是因为丙烯在Co@Si-BEA上以有利的配置吸附，导致吸附量更少和强度较弱。这一特性贡献于其在PDH反应中高丙烯选择性、活动性和稳定性。

5. 通过去铝化处理优化Co@Si-BEA催化剂中Co位点和表面酸位点的结构，显著提高了丙烷中间体的脱附性质。这导致了包括高丙烯选择性、活动性和抗结焦稳定性在内的催化性能的改进。
