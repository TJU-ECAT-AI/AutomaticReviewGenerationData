To enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores. The dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite serves as a support, and Co2+ catalysts are prepared by the vacuum impregnation method. This approach investigates the effects of dealumination pretreatment on the BEA zeolite support, focusing on the structural properties of Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites, as well as the catalytic performance of PDH reactions. The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with silanol produced during dealumination, play a crucial role in the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst. Moreover, the Co@Si-BEA catalyst shows remarkable long-term catalytic stability in reaction-regeneration recycling tests, highlighting the high structural stability of the catalyst active sites and the reversible deactivation caused by coke deposition.

为了提高PDH反应的可接近性，分级沸石结合了微孔和介孔/大孔。去铝化的Si-BEA沸石用作支持物，并通过真空浸渍法制备Co2+催化剂。这种方法研究了去铝化预处理对BEA沸石支撑的影响，重点关注Co2+活性位点的结构特性、表面酸位以及PDH反应的催化性能。在去铝化过程中与硅醇基团相互作用而锚定在沸石微孔中的孤立Co2+离子在去铝化Co@Si-BEA催化剂中起着关键作用。此外，Co@Si-BEA催化剂在反应-再生循环测试中表现出卓越的长期催化稳定性，突显了催化剂活性位点的高结构稳定性和由焦炭沉积引起的可逆失活现象。
