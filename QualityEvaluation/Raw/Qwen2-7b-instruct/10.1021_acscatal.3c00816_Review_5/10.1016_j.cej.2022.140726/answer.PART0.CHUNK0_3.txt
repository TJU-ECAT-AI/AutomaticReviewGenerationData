[1] "The effects of dealumination pretreatment on the BEA zeolite support are investigated with respect to structural property of Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites as well as the catalytic PDH performance."
[2] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[3] "The dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as a support leads to a higher surface area and pore volume compared to the original BEA zeolite."
[4] "The Co2+ cations introduced into the zeolites can act as catalytically active Lewis acid sites (LAS) for selective PDH reaction into propylene."
[5] "By contrast, if excessive Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are present in the modified zeolites, undesirable side reactions might be promoted for reducing propylene selectivity and forming coke species in PDH reactions."

1. The dealumination pretreatment affects the structure of the Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites on the BEA zeolite support, influencing the catalytic performance of PDH reactions.

2. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions.

3. The dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite, with a higher surface area and pore volume, improves the catalytic performance of PDH reactions compared to the original BEA zeolite.

4. The Co2+ cations in the zeolites act as active Lewis acid sites (LAS) for selective PDH reactions leading to propylene.

5. Excessive Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in modified zeolites can reduce propylene selectivity and cause coke formation during PDH reactions.

1. 处理前的去铝处理影响了BEA沸石支持物上的Co2+活性位点和表面酸性位点的结构，进而影响PDH反应的催化性能。

2. 分级沸石结合了微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。

3. 去铝后的Si-BEA沸石具有更高的比表面积和孔体积，从而提高了PDH反应的催化性能与原始BEA沸石相比。

4. 沸石中的Co2+离子作为选择性PDH反应中丙烯的活性Lewis酸中心（LAS）起作用。

5. 在修改后的沸石中过量的Brnsted酸中心（BAS）可能导致丙烯选择性的降低和在PDH反应中形成焦炭。
