[1] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[2] "Subnanometric Pt clusters seem to show a higher probability of interacting with subnanometric Sn species during long reduction times."
[3] "The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the propane dehydrogenation reaction was analysed by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 6671, the amount of coke in all the samples remained below 1wt%, but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke was found."

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-level pore structure that allows for better diffusion of reactants and products. This structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing more surface area for the catalytic sites, facilitating faster and more efficient reactions, and reducing the likelihood of product inhibition due to improved product release. The main types of these materials include MFI, MEL, and ZSM-5 zeolites, among others. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal processes or sol-gel methods to create the desired pore structure and control the size and shape of the pores. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by enabling more effective adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity.

The key synthesis methods for these materials typically involve the use of template agents to control the pore structure during the hydrothermal or sol-gel processes. The choice of template agent, reaction conditions, and post-synthesis treatments can significantly impact the pore size, shape, and connectivity of the zeolite materials. By carefully controlling these parameters, researchers can tailor the materials to optimize their catalytic performance for specific PDH reactions.
