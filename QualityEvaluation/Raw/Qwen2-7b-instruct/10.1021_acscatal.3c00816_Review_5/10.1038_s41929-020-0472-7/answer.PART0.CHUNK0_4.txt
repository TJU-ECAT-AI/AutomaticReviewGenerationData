[1] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[2] "However, the resulting large alloyed PtM particles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an interest in designing more active, selective and stable subnanometric bimetallic catalysts."
[3] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[4] "The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ XAS."
[5] "The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge XAS."
[6] "We should note that only small Sn clusters adjacent to small Pt clusters can be detected by this analysis method because of the lack of sensitivity to locate single Sn atoms, as discussed in our previous work."
[7] "To demonstrate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "As can be seen in Fig. 7a, after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics."

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a larger surface area for reactants and products to interact, thus improving reaction kinetics. The main types of these materials include MFI, MOR, and BEA zeolites, among others. Synthesis methods typically involve hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel methods, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering enhanced stability, selectivity, and activity, primarily due to their tailored pore size and structure. The precise interaction between Pt and Sn in subnanometric clusters, located in the 10R channels of MFI zeolite, is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance. The Pt and Sn species undergo reduction during hydrogen treatment, altering their coordination environments and influencing the catalytic activity. This study demonstrates that the structure of the PtSn clusters, including their size, shape, and location within the zeolite framework, significantly impacts the catalytic efficiency for propane dehydrogenation.

层状沸石，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，通过增加反应物和产物的交互面积，从而提高PDH反应的动力学，进而改善反应性能。这类材料的主要类型包括MFI、MOR和BEA沸石等。合成方法通常涉及水热合成、溶胶-凝胶法和离子交换技术。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过提供增强的稳定性、选择性和活性来改进PDH反应，主要得益于它们定制的孔隙大小和结构。在MFI沸石的10R通道中，亚纳米尺度的PtSn簇之间的精确相互作用对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要。在氢处理过程中，Pt和Sn物种的还原改变了它们的配位环境，影响了催化剂活性。这项研究显示，PtSn簇的结构，包括其大小、形状和在沸石框架内的位置，显著影响丙烷脱氢的催化效率。
