<p>Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream.</p>
<p>The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).</p>
<p>In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 1ad and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, the location of the singly dispersed Pt atoms in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample was determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging.</p>
<p>To ensure the presence of atomically dispersed Pt atoms in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, a reference K-MFI sample (without Sn or Pt) was analysed and compared.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 2a, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference.</p>
<p>The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge XAS.</p>
<p>Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C.</p>
<p>After treatment with H2 at 600C, the Sn(IV) species are reduced to Sn species with an average of approximately three SnO bonds, according to the EXAFS data (Table 1).</p>
<p>Interestingly, these properties can be controlled by varying the reduction time, following a change in structure that is too subtle to be detected by EXAFS.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the presence of Sn in these catalysts has a strong effect on the catalytic properties of Pt, which will be discussed later in this report.</p>
<p>For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means clustering analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduction into the microscope (see Fig. 3eh).</p>
<p>When the reduced samples were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close proximity to Pt decayed markedly (Fig. 4).</p>
<p>As noted above, the K-means clustering analysis is based on two-dimensional projection images, whereas the K-PtSn@MFI zeolite is a three-dimensional material.</p>
<p>Characterization of PtSn clusters by CO adsorption To detect possible PtSn interactions in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples, we employed IR spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule to investigate the electronic properties of the Pt species.</p>
<p>These changes indicate the modulation of the electronic structures of the Pt clusters during the H2 treatment, which may be related to the interaction between Pt and Sn species.</p>
<p>According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(IV) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn species can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters.</p>
<p>As displayed in Fig. 5b, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6h.</p>
<p>According to the above results, it can be deduced that a long reduction treatment at 600C is necessary to form subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species that show high activity, selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation.</p>

To enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores. The main types include MFI, MOR, and ZSM-5 zeolites. These materials are synthesized through hydrothermal processes, typically involving the use of metal salts and alkali metals as precursors. The synthesis methods often involve a template to control pore size and shape, followed by removal of the template. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore architecture, which facilitates easier access for reactants and products.

为了提高PDH反应的可及性，层次结构沸石结合了微孔和介孔/大孔。主要类型包括MFI、MOR和ZSM-5沸石。这些材料通过水热合成过程制备，通常使用金属盐和碱金属作为前体。合成方法通常涉及模板来控制孔径大小和形状，随后去除模板。与传统沸石相比，层次结构沸石在PDH反应中的性能有所提高，这是由于其增强的孔结构，可以更方便地使反应物和产物进入。
