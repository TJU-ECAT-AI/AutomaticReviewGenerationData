<p>Structural modulation and direct measurement of subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolites Modulating the structures of subnanometric metal clusters at the atomic level is a great synthetic and characterization challenge in catalysis. Here, we show how the catalytic properties of subnanometric platinum clusters (0.50.6nm) confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite are modulated upon introduction of partially reduced tin species that interact with the noble metal at the metal/support interface.</p>
<p>Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1. Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity2,3,4.</p>
<p>In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance. To understand the interaction between the subnanometric Pt and Sn species, we have employed several characterization techniques, including XAS, quasi in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO infrared (CO-IR) spectroscopy. It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a larger surface area for reactants and products to interact. These materials are synthesized through various methods, including sol-gel processes, template-directed synthesis, and sonochemical methods. The improved performance compared to traditional zeolites is attributed to their enhanced porosity and pore size distribution, which facilitates better diffusion of reactants and products, reduces thermal resistance, and allows for more efficient use of the active sites. The precise synthesis conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the use of specific templates, are crucial in achieving the desired pore structure and size, leading to superior catalytic activity and stability for PDH reactions.
