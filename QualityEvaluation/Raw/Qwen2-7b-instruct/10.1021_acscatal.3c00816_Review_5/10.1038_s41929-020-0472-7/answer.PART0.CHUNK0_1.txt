<p>In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance.</p>
<p>To understand the interaction between the subnanometric Pt and Sn species, we have employed several characterization techniques, including XAS, quasi in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO infrared (CO-IR) spectroscopy. It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means clustering analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduction into the microscope. When the reduced samples were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close proximity to Pt decayed markedly.</p>
<p>As noted above, the K-means clustering analysis is based on two-dimensional projection images, whereas the K-PtSn@MFI zeolite is a three-dimensional material. Moreover, the complicated structure of K-PtSn@MFI also makes it difficult to distinguish the Pt and Sn species, which has already been explained in our previous work.</p>
<p>According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(IV) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn species can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>As can be seen in Fig. 7a, after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics.</p>
<p>When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600C for 1h before the propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions of our previous work), then the initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to propylene increased to 93%.</p>
<p>More importantly, the deactivation rate was lower than that of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample. When the pre-reduction time at 600C was further increased to 3, 6 and 12h (Fig. 7ce), the initial conversion of propane remained almost unchanged, whereas the deactivation of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst was markedly suppressed.</p>
<p>Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion.</p>

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area for reactants to interact with the catalyst. Main types of these materials include MFI, MEL, BEA, and ZSM-5 zeolites. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel processes, and ion-exchange techniques. These materials improve PDH reactions by facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the risk of coke formation, and allowing for more efficient use of precious metals like Pt and Sn.
