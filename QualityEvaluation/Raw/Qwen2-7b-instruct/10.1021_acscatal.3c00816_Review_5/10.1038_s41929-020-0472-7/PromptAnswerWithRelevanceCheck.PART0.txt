<p>Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream.</p>
<p>The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).</p>
<p>In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 1ad and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, the location of the singly dispersed Pt atoms in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample was determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging.</p>
<p>To ensure the presence of atomically dispersed Pt atoms in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, a reference K-MFI sample (without Sn or Pt) was analysed and compared.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 2a, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference.</p>
<p>The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge XAS.</p>
<p>Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C.</p>
<p>After treatment with H2 at 600C, the Sn(IV) species are reduced to Sn species with an average of approximately three SnO bonds, according to the EXAFS data (Table 1).</p>
<p>Interestingly, these properties can be controlled by varying the reduction time, following a change in structure that is too subtle to be detected by EXAFS.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the presence of Sn in these catalysts has a strong effect on the catalytic properties of Pt, which will be discussed later in this report.</p>
<p>For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means clustering analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduction into the microscope (see Fig. 3eh).</p>
<p>When the reduced samples were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close proximity to Pt decayed markedly (Fig. 4).</p>
<p>As noted above, the K-means clustering analysis is based on two-dimensional projection images, whereas the K-PtSn@MFI zeolite is a three-dimensional material.</p>
<p>Characterization of PtSn clusters by CO adsorption To detect possible PtSn interactions in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples, we employed IR spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule to investigate the electronic properties of the Pt species.</p>
<p>These changes indicate the modulation of the electronic structures of the Pt clusters during the H2 treatment, which may be related to the interaction between Pt and Sn species.</p>
<p>According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(IV) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn species can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters.</p>
<p>As displayed in Fig. 5b, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6h.</p>
<p>According to the above results, it can be deduced that a long reduction treatment at 600C is necessary to form subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species that show high activity, selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation.</p>

To enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores. The main types include MFI, MOR, and ZSM-5 zeolites. These materials are synthesized through hydrothermal processes, typically involving the use of metal salts and alkali metals as precursors. The synthesis methods often involve a template to control pore size and shape, followed by removal of the template. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore architecture, which facilitates easier access for reactants and products.

Answer: Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. Main types include MFI, MOR, and ZSM-5 zeolites, synthesized through hydrothermal processes with templates controlling pore size and shape. Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance due to their enhanced pore architecture facilitating easier access for reactants and products.

<p>To understand the interaction between the subnanometric Pt and Sn species, we have employed several characterization techniques, including XAS, quasi in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO infrared (CO-IR) spectroscopy. It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means clustering analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduction into the microscope. When the reduced samples were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close proximity to Pt decayed markedly.</p>
<p>As noted above, the K-means clustering analysis is based on two-dimensional projection images, whereas the K-PtSn@MFI zeolite is a three-dimensional material. Moreover, the complicated structure of K-PtSn@MFI also makes it difficult to distinguish the Pt and Sn species, which has already been explained in our previous work.</p>
<p>According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(IV) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn species can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>As can be seen in Fig. 7a, after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics.</p>
<p>When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600C for 1h before the propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions of our previous work), then the initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to propylene increased to 93%.</p>
<p>More importantly, the deactivation rate was lower than that of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample. When the pre-reduction time at 600C was further increased to 3, 6 and 12h (Fig. 7ce), the initial conversion of propane remained almost unchanged, whereas the deactivation of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst was markedly suppressed.</p>
<p>Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion.</p>

The hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-level pore structure that allows for better diffusion of reactants and products. This structure improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing more surface area for the catalytic sites, facilitating faster and more efficient reactions, and reducing the likelihood of product inhibition due to improved product release. The main types of these materials include MFI, MEL, and ZSM-5 zeolites, among others. Synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal processes or sol-gel methods to create the desired pore structure and control the size and shape of the pores. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by enabling more effective adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity.

The key synthesis methods for these materials typically involve the use of template agents to control the pore structure during the hydrothermal or sol-gel processes. The choice of template agent, reaction conditions, and post-synthesis treatments can significantly impact the pore size, shape, and connectivity of the zeolite materials. By carefully controlling these parameters, researchers can tailor the materials to optimize their catalytic performance for specific PDH reactions.

<p>Structural modulation and direct measurement of subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolites Modulating the structures of subnanometric metal clusters at the atomic level is a great synthetic and characterization challenge in catalysis. Here, we show how the catalytic properties of subnanometric platinum clusters (0.50.6nm) confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite are modulated upon introduction of partially reduced tin species that interact with the noble metal at the metal/support interface.</p>
<p>Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1. Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity2,3,4.</p>

Hierarchical zeolites, combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a larger surface area for reactants and products to interact. These materials are synthesized through various methods, including sol-gel processes, template-directed synthesis, and sonochemical methods. The improved performance compared to traditional zeolites is attributed to their enhanced porosity and pore size distribution, which facilitates better diffusion of reactants and products, reduces thermal resistance, and allows for more efficient use of the active sites. The precise synthesis conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the use of specific templates, are crucial in achieving the desired pore structure and size, leading to superior catalytic activity and stability for PDH reactions.
