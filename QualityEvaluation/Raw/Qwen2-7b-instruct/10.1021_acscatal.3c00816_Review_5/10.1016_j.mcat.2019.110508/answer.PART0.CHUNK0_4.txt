[1] "HZSM-5 zeolites with varying molar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (30, 50, 80 and 250) were provided by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd."
[2] "As a result, ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[3] "Comprehensive techniques including N2 sorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, DR UVvis, XPS, C3H6-TPD, NH3-TPD and TGA jointly evidence that the high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions."
[4] "The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."
