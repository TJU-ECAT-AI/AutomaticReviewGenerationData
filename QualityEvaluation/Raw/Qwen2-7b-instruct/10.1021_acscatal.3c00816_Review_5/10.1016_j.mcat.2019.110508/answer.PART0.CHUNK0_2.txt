The document discusses the use of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It highlights the importance of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in determining the catalytic activity, stability, and reusability of the catalysts. The text states that the catalysts with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio exhibit high catalytic activity, stability, and reusability in PDH. The comprehensive techniques used in the study include N2 sorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, DR UVvis, XPS, C3H6-TPD, NH3-TPD, and TGA. It mentions that the high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with its good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. The document also proposes that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The text further states that the ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, thus promising for industrial propylene production.
