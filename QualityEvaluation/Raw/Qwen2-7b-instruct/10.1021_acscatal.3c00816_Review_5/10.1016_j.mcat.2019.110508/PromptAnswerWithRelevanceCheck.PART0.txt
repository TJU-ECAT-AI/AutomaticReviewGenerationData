[1] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity."
[2] "ZnO supported on the high-silica HZSM-5 was found to be an efficient catalyst for PDH as compared to the ZnO catalysts on other supports (e.g. low-silica HZSM-5, silicalite-1, Al2O3 and SiO2)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hierarchical zeolites, such as high-silica HZSM-5, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a well-defined structure with sparse Al sites. This allows for the even distribution of Zn species throughout the support, directly impacting the catalytic activity of the material. The high specific surface area and large pore volume of high-silica HZSM-5 facilitate the dispersion of Zn species, leading to improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

2. Compared to other supports like low-silica HZSM-5, silicalite-1, Al2O3, and SiO2, ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is found to be an efficient catalyst for PDH. This efficiency is attributed to the advantageous properties of high-silica HZSM-5, including its hierarchical pore structure, which enhances the accessibility of ZnO for PDH reactions.

1. 高硅含量的HZSM-5等层级沸石通过提供清晰定义的结构和稀疏的Al位点，结合微孔与介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应过程中的可接近性。高表面积和大孔体积以及其清晰的结构使得Zn物种能够均匀分布在整个支持物中，直接关系到催化剂的活性。高硅含量的HZSM-5的独特结构特性，如其分级孔隙系统，提高了ZnO在PDH反应中的可及性，从而在PDH反应中表现出比传统沸石更好的性能。

2. 相对于低硅HZSM-5、硅铝凝胶、Al2O3和SiO2等其他支撑材料，高硅含量的HZSM-5上负载的ZnO被发现是PDH反应中高效的催化剂。这一效率归因于高硅HZSM-5的有利特性，包括其层级孔结构，这增强了ZnO对PDH反应的可及性。与其他支撑材料相比，这种材料在PDH反应中的性能表现更优。

The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h. As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 250 demonstrates superior performance in PDH reactions. It maintains a high propane conversion of approximately 43% alongside a strong propylene selectivity of 93% even after 10 hours of reaction. This catalyst's enhanced catalytic activity and stability are attributed to the increased SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the HZSM-5 support.

The document discusses the use of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It highlights the importance of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in determining the catalytic activity, stability, and reusability of the catalysts. The text states that the catalysts with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio exhibit high catalytic activity, stability, and reusability in PDH. The comprehensive techniques used in the study include N2 sorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, DR UVvis, XPS, C3H6-TPD, NH3-TPD, and TGA. It mentions that the high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with its good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. The document also proposes that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The text further states that the ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, thus promising for industrial propylene production.
