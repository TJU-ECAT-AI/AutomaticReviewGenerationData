The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h. As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 250 demonstrates superior performance in PDH reactions. It maintains a high propane conversion of approximately 43% alongside a strong propylene selectivity of 93% even after 10 hours of reaction. This catalyst's enhanced catalytic activity and stability are attributed to the increased SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the HZSM-5 support.
