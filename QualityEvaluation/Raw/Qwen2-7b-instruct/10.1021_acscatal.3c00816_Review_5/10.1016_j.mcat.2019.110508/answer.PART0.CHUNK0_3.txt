[1] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."
[2] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."
[3] "Moreover, the catalytic activity of small bonded ZnO clusters in the PDH reaction is proposed."
[4] "This catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 exhibits great catalytic activity and reaction stability, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction."

1. Hierarchical zeolites, such as high-silica HZSM-5, combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The high specific surface area and large pore volume facilitate the distribution of Zn species throughout the support, improving catalytic activity. The well-defined structure and sparse Al sites prevent the aggregation of ZnO into bulk particles on the zeolite surface.

2. The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 improves propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability. This is achieved by promoting propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions through the modulation of acidity levels.

3. The catalytic activity of small bonded ZnO clusters within the PDH reaction is highlighted. These clusters, directly connected with the framework of the zeolite, are proposed to be active phases responsible for the catalytic performance.

4. The use of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity and reaction stability. This system offers a promising avenue for the development of highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reactions.

1. 高硅含量HZSM-5等分级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性。高比表面积和大孔体积有助于Zn物种在整个支撑材料中的分布，从而提高催化活性。明确的结构和稀疏的Al位点防止了ZnO在沸石表面聚集为块状颗粒。

2. 高硅含量HZSM-5的适中酸性可以显著提高丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。通过调节酸性水平，促进了丙烯的脱附并减少了副反应。

3. PDH反应中小型键合ZnO簇的催化活性被强调。这些簇直接与沸石骨架相连，被认为是活性相，负责催化性能。

4. 将ZnO加载到高硅含量HZSM-5上的系统展示了出色的催化活性和反应稳定性。这个系统为开发高效过渡金属催化剂提供了有前景的方向，用于PDH反应。
