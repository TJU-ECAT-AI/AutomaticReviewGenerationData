Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. They are categorized into nanostructured zeolites, templated mesoporous materials, and hybrid materials that combine zeolite and mesoporous components. Synthesis methodologies include the application of template agents, sol-gel techniques, and hydrothermal processes to produce well-defined pore structures. These materials enhance PDH reactions by offering larger surface areas, increased porosity, and controlled pore sizes that optimize diffusion rates and catalyst accessibility.
