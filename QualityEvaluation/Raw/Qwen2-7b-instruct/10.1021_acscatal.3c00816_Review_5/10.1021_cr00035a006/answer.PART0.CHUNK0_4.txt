Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to optimize accessibility for PDH reactions. They are categorized into three main types: mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and hybrid zeolites. These materials are synthesized by initially creating ordered mesopores using template molecules, followed by incorporating zeolite crystals within these structures. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate superior performance in PDH reactions due to their increased surface areas and controlled pore size distribution. They exhibit enhanced selectivity, higher conversion rates, and reduced coke formation, thus improving overall reaction efficiency.

层状沸石整合微孔和介孔/大孔，以优化PDH反应的可达性。它们主要分为三种类型：介孔沸石、大孔沸石和混合沸石。这些材料通过首先使用模板分子创建有序的介孔，然后在这些结构中引入沸石晶体来合成。与传统沸石相比，层状沸石在PDH反应中的性能更好，由于其增加的表面积和可控的孔径分布。它们表现出更高的选择性、更高的转化率和减少的焦炭形成，从而提高整体反应效率。
