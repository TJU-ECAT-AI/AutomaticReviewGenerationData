[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "These materials are mainly synthesized through methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, and template techniques."
[3] "Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore structure and increased surface area."
