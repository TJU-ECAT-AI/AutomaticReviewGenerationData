<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to optimize accessibility for PDH reactions. They are categorized into three main types: mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and hybrid zeolites. These materials are synthesized by initially creating ordered mesopores using template molecules, followed by incorporating zeolite crystals within these structures. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate superior performance in PDH reactions due to their increased surface areas and controlled pore size distribution. They exhibit enhanced selectivity, higher conversion rates, and reduced coke formation, thus improving overall reaction efficiency.
