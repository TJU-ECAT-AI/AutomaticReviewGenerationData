          [1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
          [2] "These materials are mainly synthesized through methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, and template techniques."
          [3] "Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to their enhanced pore structure and increased surface area."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. These materials are primarily fabricated using sol-gel, hydrothermal, and template methodologies. Hierarchical zeolites outperform traditional zeolites in PDH reaction performance because of their enhanced pore architecture and expanded surface area.

          [1] "The main types include nanostructured, porous, and hierarchical zeolites."
          [2] "Synthesis methods involve template-directed assembly, sol-gel processes, and hydrothermal synthesis."
          [3] "These materials improve PDH reaction performance by increasing surface area and pore volume."

      <English>
          The primary categories of hierarchical zeolites are nanostructured, porous, and hierarchical zeolites. Their fabrication techniques encompass template-directed assembly, sol-gel procedures, and hydrothermal synthesis. These materials elevate PDH reaction efficiency by expanding both surface area and pore volume.
