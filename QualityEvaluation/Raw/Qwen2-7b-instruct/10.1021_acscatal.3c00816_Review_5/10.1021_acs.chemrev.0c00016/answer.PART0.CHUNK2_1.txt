[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites are considered to be promising supports in bifunctional FTS catalysts, which provide improved product selectivity toward long-chain hydrocarbons."
[2] "The catalytic performance of these supported mesoporous zeolite nanosponges indicated that a large portion of the surfaces was accessible for high catalytic activity through the zeolitic micropore apertures located on the mesopore wall."
[3] "The introduction of mesopores into the catalyst support can efficiently overcome the diffusion limitations and significantly accelerate the mass transfer to and away from the catalytic centers, thus reducing the possibility of secondary reactions which cause coke formation and catalyst deactivation."

Hierarchically porous zeolites are used as promising supports in bifunctional Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts. They improve product selectivity towards long-chain hydrocarbons. The high catalytic performance of mesoporous zeolite nanosponges is attributed to the accessibility of a large portion of the surface through zeolitic micropore apertures located on the mesopore wall. The introduction of mesopores into catalyst supports accelerates mass transfer, reducing secondary reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

异构多孔沸石用作双功能费歇尔-特罗斯合成（FTS）催化剂的有前景支持。它们提高了长链烃产品的选择性。具有高催化性能的介孔沸石纳米海绵的性能归因于通过位于介孔壁上的沸石微孔开口可访问的大部分表面。引入介孔孔可以加速物质传递，减少导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的副反应。
