<p>In Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners Hierarchically porous Zeolite composites can be prepared by partial crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41 in the presence of appropriate microporous structure-directing agents. The resultant zeolite composites are exactly zeolite nanocrystals supported on or embedded into an amorphous mesoporous matrix.</p>
<p>Ex Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners Hierarchically structured zeolite composites can also be prepared by first impregnation of mesoporous silicas (SBA-15) (433) or mesoporous cellular foams (MCFs) (227) with zeolite seeds and then hydrothermal treatment.</p>
<p>Complete Crystallization of Active Composite Partners As discussed above, a partial crystallization of active support yields a zeolite-containing composite material while a complete transformation of ordered mesoporous materials results in a purely crystalline zeolite phase. The crystallization of preformed meso- or microporous supports is an efficient method to prepare zeolitic monoliths with hierarchical porosity.</p>
<p>Postsynthesis Approach In contrast to the synthesis strategies discussed above, additional porosity can also be created within zeolites by postsynthesis treatment of zeolite crystals that leads to the formation of secondary meso-macropores. (477485)</p>

Hierarchically porous zeolite composites can be prepared through in situ crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves like MCM-41 in the presence of microporous structure-directing agents. Ex situ methods involve impregnating mesoporous silicas or cellular foams with zeolite seeds followed by hydrothermal treatment. Complete crystallization of preformed meso- or microporous supports yields zeolitic monoliths with hierarchical porosity. Postsynthesis treatments can introduce additional meso- or macropores into zeolites, enhancing their properties.

通过在微孔结构导向剂的存在下，原位结晶介孔分子筛如MCM-41可以制备分级多孔的沸石复合材料。离线方法涉及用沸石种子浸渍介孔硅或泡沫，随后进行水热处理。完全结晶预形成的介孔或微孔支持物会产生具有分级孔隙的沸石微粒。后合成处理可以向沸石中引入额外的介孔或宏观孔，增强其性能。

<p>Recrystallization The recrystallization approach involving zeolite dissolution and reassembly was first reported by Goto et al. in 2002 (513) and later by Ivanova et al. in 2004. (364)</p>
<p>Postsynthetic Treatment Postsynthetic approaches including steaming and acid or alkaline leaching have been used to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites for decades due to their simplicity, scalability, and low cost. In these methods, most of the created mesopores are isolated cavities in the crystals and thus cannot significantly contribute to accelerating the mass transport.</p>

The recrystallization technique, which involves dissolving and then reassembling zeolites, was initially reported by Goto et al. in 2002 and later by Ivanova et al. in 2004. Post-synthesis treatments, such as steaming and acid or alkaline leaching, have been widely used for synthesizing hierarchically porous zeolites due to their ease of implementation, scalability, and low cost. However, most of the mesopores created through these methods are isolated within the crystal structure, which limits their contribution to mass transport enhancement.

重新结晶技术，即溶解后重组沸石的方法，最初由Goto等人于2002年报道，并在2004年由Ivanova等人进一步报道。后合成处理，如蒸煮和酸性或碱性蚀刻，由于其实施简单、可扩展性和低成本，长期以来一直用于合成分级多孔沸石。然而，通过这些方法创建的大多数介孔是在晶体结构内的孤立空腔，限制了它们对增强质量传输的贡献。

<p>Catalytic Application The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Introducing meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can greatly enhance mass transport, shorten the diffusion paths of reactants, and improve the access of reactants to and the release of products from the catalytic active sites in catalytic reactions. This leads to increased conversion efficiency of reactants and product selectivity, as well as an extended lifespan of the catalyst.

将介孔或宏观孔引入微孔沸石中，可以显著提高质量传输，缩短反应物的扩散路径，并改善反应物到达和产物释放到催化剂活性位点的能力。这导致反应物转化率和产品选择性的增加，以及催化剂寿命的延长。
