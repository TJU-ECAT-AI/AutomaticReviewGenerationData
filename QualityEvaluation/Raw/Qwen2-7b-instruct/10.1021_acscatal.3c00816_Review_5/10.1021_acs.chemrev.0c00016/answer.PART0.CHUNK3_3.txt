[1] "The introduction of a hierarchical structure into zeolites can greatly improve the catalytic conversion."
[2] "Hierarchical zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules."
[3] "The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites."

1. The hierarchical structure of zeolites enhances catalytic conversion by allowing for improved mass transfer and shortened diffusion paths.

2. Hierarchically porous zeolites are used in adsorptive desulfurization due to their ability to shorten the diffusion path to internal active sites, benefiting interactions with bulky molecules.

3. The inclusion of mesoporosity in zeolites enables bulky sulfur compounds to access the active sites more efficiently, improving desulfurization performance.

1. 阶梯结构的沸石可以显著提高催化转化，通过改善质量传输并缩短扩散路径。

2. 阶梯型多孔沸石在脱硫中被使用，因为它们能够缩短到达内部活性位点的扩散路径，有利于与大分子的相互作用。

3. 在沸石中引入介孔结构使得大分子硫化合物能够更有效地访问活性位点，从而提高脱硫性能。
