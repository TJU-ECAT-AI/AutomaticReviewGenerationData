[1] "Integrating additional pores into microporous zeolites is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent diffusion limitations and improve the utilization of zeolites."
[2] "For example, Fathi et al. (642) studied the catalytic performance of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores. The presence of intracrystalline mesopores generated by the post-treatment of HZSM-5 catalyst using CaCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH solutions ameliorated the catalytic performance to produce a higher amount of gasoline-range hydrocarbons."
[3] "The introduction of additional pores can significantly boost the diffusion rate of molecules in the zeolites, thus leading to a prolonged catalyst life."
[4] "For example, Fathi et al. (642) found that the sample treated by Na2CO3 showed the most appropriate acidity and greater catalytic performance among the other treated and untreated samples in the methanol to gasoline reactions."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a system where the micropores and mesopores/macropores are interconnected, allowing for easier access to the active sites and improving mass transfer. The main types of these materials include hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores, which can be generated through post-treatment methods using substances like CaCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH. The synthesis methods often involve hydrothermal treatment or other techniques that promote the formation of hierarchical structures with interconnected pores. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions by facilitating better accessibility to active sites, enhancing mass transfer, and reducing the deposition of coke, which prolongs the catalyst life and improves the selectivity and yield of desired products.
