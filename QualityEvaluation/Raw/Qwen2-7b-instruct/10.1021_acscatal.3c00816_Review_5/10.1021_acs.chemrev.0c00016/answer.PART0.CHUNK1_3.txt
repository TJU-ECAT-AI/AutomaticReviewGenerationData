[1] "The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts."
[2] "These hierarchical zeolites can be prepared by using a single principle or a combination of two or three principles during the synthesis process."
[3] "The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites can be achieved either by introducing an additional pore system into zeolite single crystals, either during the crystallization process of the zeolite crystal or in an already synthesized microporous zeolite (intracrystalline mesopore), or by a purposeful aggregation of individual zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets (intercrystalline mesopore)."

1. Hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by accelerating mass transport, reducing the diffusion path of reactants, and improving their access to and egress from catalytic active sites. This leads to increased reactant conversion and product selectivity, as well as extended catalyst lifetime.

2. Hierarchical zeolites can be synthesized using a single or combination of principles during the crystallization, aggregation, or extraction processes.

3. These materials can be prepared by introducing meso- or macropores either during the crystallization of zeolite single crystals or through the aggregation of individual zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets.

1. 层状沸石通过加速物质传输，减少反应物扩散路径以及改善反应物至催化活性位点的访问和产物的逸出，显著提高了PDH反应的性能。这导致了反应物转化率和产物选择性的增加，以及催化剂寿命的延长。

2. 层状沸石可以通过单一或组合原理在结晶、聚集或提取过程中合成。

3. 这些材料可以通过在单晶沸石结晶过程中引入介孔或大孔，或者通过单晶沸石纳米晶体或纳米片的聚集来制备。
