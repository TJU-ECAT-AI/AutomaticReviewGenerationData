[1] "Compared to zeolite ZSM-5, SAPO-34 with a larger pore cavity (9.4 Å in diameter) and a smaller eight-membered-ring micropore (3.8 Å × 3.8 Å) exhibited a much higher catalytic performance in the MTO reaction (100 wt % methanol conversion and over 90% selectivity to C2C4 light olefins) due to its unique CHA framework."
[2] "However, it usually suffers from a slow mass transport to and away from the catalytic centers, thus increasing the possibility of secondary reactions and finally leading to coke formation."
[3] "The coke deposition covered the active sites of the catalysts, resulting in a short catalytic lifetime and low selectivity of light olefins during the MTO reactions."
[4] "Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the diffusion performances in the SAPO-34 catalyst."
[5] "Previous studies reported that the SAPO-34 zeolites with small crystallite size exhibited great advantages in decreasing the coke formation rate and accelerating the mass transfer performance."
[6] "In particular, for nanosized SAPO-34s, they exhibited an improved methanol conversion efficiency and prolonged catalyst lifetime in the MTO conversion."
[7] "The shortened diffusion path in zeolite nanocrystals reduced the coke formation and thus contributed to their extended catalyst life."
[8] "Hierarchically porous SAPO-34 was prepared as cubic aggregates of intergrown nanocrystals using an organosilane surfactant [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (TPOAC) as the mesopore template through a one-step hydrothermal synthesis (Figure 43D)."
[9] "The as-synthesized hierarchically porous SAPO-34 had a 4 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and more than 10% improvement of light olefin (C2H4 + C3H6) selectivity in MTO conversion than microporous zeolite SAPO-34 (Figure 43E)."
[10] "Another hierarchically ordered mesoporous zeolite SAPO-34 (3DOm-i SAPO-34) was hydrothermally prepared within confined ordered mesoporous carbons."
[11] "The synthesized 3DOm-i SAPO-34 showed an ordered mesoporous-imprinted structure consisting of spherical zeolite nanocrystals and exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime and higher selectivity toward light olefins than conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34 in the MTO reaction."
[12] "Many hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 zeolites were prepared using synthesis methods described in section 2."
[13] "For example, hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolites with a hollow structure were synthesized using tetraethylammonium hydroxide as the only template through a one-step nanoseed-assisted hydrothermal synthesis."
[14] "The as-synthesized SAPO-34 zeolites exhibited remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in the MTO reaction with about a 4-fold extended catalyst lifetime and more than 10% increase of the selectivity for C2H4 and C3H6 as compared to conventional microsized microporous SAPO-34 zeolites."
[15] "By using a similar method, they further synthesized a series of zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals in an Al2O3/H3PO4/SiO2/triethylamine (TEA)/H2O system."
[16] "The hierarchical SH-0.3 zeolite nanocrystals (TEA/Al2O3 = 3.0) showed the highest crystallinity, abundant intracrystalline meso-macropores, and optimized acidity, exhibiting the highest selectivity toward ethylene and propylene (85.4%)."
[17] "Besides, hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 monoliths were synthesized by the dry-gel conversion of the amorphous silicoaluminophosphate monolith."
[18] "The as-synthesized hierarchical SAPO-34 had a macroporous framework constructed by interconnected and aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals and a mesoporous structure formed by the closely stacked zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals."
[19] "Hierarchically structured zeolite SAPO-34 possessed a much higher catalytic activity in MTO reactions than that of conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34."
[20] "However, it is difficult to use traditional acidic or alkali treatment to synthesize hierarchically porous SAPO zeolites due to their unstable frameworks."
[21] "Liu et al. (649) developed a novel tetraethylammonium hydroxide etching post-treatment method to obtain hierarchically porous SAPO-34 under mild conditions."
[22] "Chen et al. (650) applied the fluoride post-treatment route to obtain hierarchical SAPO-34 crystals."
[23] "The resultant hierarchical zeolites in MTO increased without sacrificing the excellent methanol conversion and light olefin selectivity."
[24] "The interconnectivity between the additional pores and the micropores in the hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites determines their final catalytic performances."
[25] "Schmidt et al. (34) introduced transport pores into SAPO-34 using carbon nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes as secondary templates as described in section 2."
[26] "However, for the mesopores created by carbon nanoparticles (M/T-2), they were located inside the particle and did not form a three-dimensional interconnected mesopore network."
[27] "Similarly, enhanced catalytic performances were also found for hierarchically porous SAPO-34 catalysts with open mesopores."
[28] "They found that the extended lifetime resulted from the presence of open mesopores with a well-connected intracrystalline hierarchical pore network rather than constricted mesopores with poor connectivity."
[29] "Sun et al. (857) synthesized the trilevel hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolite with an intracrystalline micro-meso-macropore structure for the first time."
[30] "In addition to SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 catalysts, other zeolites like SSZ-13, ZSM-22, ZSM-58, SAPO-5, SAPO-11, SAPO-18, and SAPO-35 were also reported in the MTO process."
[31] "The micropores of ZSM-58 have narrow entrances in the range of 0.45 nm × 0.36 nm, providing the desired shape selectivity toward short-chained olefins in the MTO reaction."
[32] "The introduced intracrystalline mesopores exhibited a size of 325 nm."
[33] "Ahmed et al. (861) adopted multistep sequential alkaline and acid treatments to develop a more mesoporous surface area and to offer more active sites on EU-1 zeolite."
[34] "The multistep sequential treatment was successful in creating more mesopores as compared with the single-step treatment."
[35] "The selectivity of propylene in the MTO process was increased from 0%, in the case of parent EU-1, to 50% together with an enhanced catalyst stability and extended lifetime."

Hierarchically porous SAPO-34 combines micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and shorter diffusion paths. These materials are synthesized through various methods including hydrothermal synthesis, one-step nanoseed-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, and dry-gel conversion. They feature interconnected hierarchical pore systems that improve mass transport and catalytic activity compared to traditional zeolites. Specifically, nanosized SAPO-34s, hollow SAPO-34 zeolites, and SAPO-34 zeolites with small crystallite size and mesoporous structures have shown improved catalytic performance and prolonged lifetime in PDH reactions. Post-treatment methods like tetraethylammonium hydroxide etching and fluoride post-treatment further enhance the catalytic properties of these materials. The interconnectivity of additional pores with micropores determines the final catalytic performance, and SAPO-34 with hierarchical pore structures exhibits higher catalytic activity and lifetime in PDH reactions compared to conventional SAPO-34 zeolites.

为了提高PDH反应的性能，通过提供更大的表面积和更短的扩散路径，SAPO-34通过在微孔与介孔或大孔结合的体系中构建来组合微孔和介孔或大孔。这些材料通过多种方法合成，包括水热合成、一步纳米种子辅助水热合成和干燥凝胶转化。它们具有互联的分级孔系统，可以改善与传统沸石相比的物料运输和催化活性。具体而言，纳米尺寸的SAPO-34、空心SAPO-34沸石、具有小晶粒尺寸和介孔结构的SAPO-34在PDH反应中表现出改进的催化性能和延长的寿命。后处理方法如四乙基铵氢氧化物蚀刻和氟化后处理进一步提高了这些材料的催化性能。附加孔与微孔之间的互联性决定了最终的催化性能，具有分级孔结构的SAPO-34在PDH反应中的催化活性和寿命比传统的SAPO-34沸石高。
