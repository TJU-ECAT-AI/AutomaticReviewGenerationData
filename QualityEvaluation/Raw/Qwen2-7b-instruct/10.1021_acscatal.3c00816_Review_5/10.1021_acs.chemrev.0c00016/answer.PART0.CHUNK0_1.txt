[1] "These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests."
[2] "The most innovative synthesis approaches are reviewed according to the principle, versatility, effectiveness, and degree of reality while establishing a firm link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality in zeolites."
[3] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic microporosity from the zeolitic framework and the introduced inter- or intracrystalline meso- or macropore system, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, such as alkylation, acylation, rearrangement, FischerTropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol conversions, cracking, and biomass conversion."
[4] "In the concluding part, we envision the emergence of material-properties-by-quantitative and real rational design based on the generalized Murrays Law that enables the predictable and controlled productions of bioinspired hierarchically structured zeolites."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing an unimpeded transport path and enhanced micropore accessibility. The main types of these materials include zeolite composites with additional materials, zeolite monoliths with built-in porosity, and zeolite structures with multiple hierarchical levels. The synthesis methods vary, but they often involve post-treatment, in situ synthesis, and the use of templates to create the additional porosity. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better mass transfer, enhanced catalytic activity, and improved sorption characteristics, leading to higher efficiency and productivity.

The hierarchical zeolites' potential lies in their ability to mimic natural transport systems, optimizing mass transport and reaction rates. The synthesis approaches aim to establish a clear link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality, ensuring the production of materials with specific pore structures. The integration of quantitative and real rational design based on generalized Murray's law promises the creation of bioinspired hierarchical zeolite structures with predictable and controlled properties.
