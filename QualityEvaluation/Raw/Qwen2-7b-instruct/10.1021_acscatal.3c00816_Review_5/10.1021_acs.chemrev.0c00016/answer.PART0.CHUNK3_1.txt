[1] "In the catalytic cracking process, large molecules in polyolefins cannot enter into the micropores, and thus, the catalytic degradation of polyolefins first takes place on the external acidic sites of the zeolite catalysts."
[2] "The catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites."
[3] "The introduction of mesopores into the zeolite frameworks can significantly improve the accessibility of bulky triglycerides to the active sites and thus boost the conversion efficiencies."
[4] "The introduction of secondary mesopores or macropores into the zeolite frameworks can significantly improve the accessibility of bulky triglycerides to the active sites and thus boost the conversion efficiencies."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing pathways for reactants and products to move through the material more efficiently. The micropores allow for the trapping and interaction of reactants and products with the active sites, while the mesopores and macropores facilitate the diffusion of these molecules through the material, minimizing transport limitations. This combination of pore sizes creates a hierarchical structure that optimizes both the trapping and the transport of reactants and products.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with a micro-mesoporous structure, micro-macroporous structure, and micro-meso-macroporous structure. Synthesis methods typically involve using direct or indirect templates to introduce meso- or macropores into the microporous zeolite framework. These methods can include in situ synthesis, where the pores are created during the synthesis process, or postsynthetic approaches, such as demetalation or desilication, where the pores are introduced after the zeolite has formed.

Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate improved performance in PDH reactions due to their ability to accelerate mass transport, reduce the diffusion path length, and improve the accessibility of active sites. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime, particularly when dealing with bulky molecules or compounds that are difficult to transport through the microporous structure of conventional zeolites.

These hierarchical zeolites can be specifically tailored for PDH reactions by optimizing the balance between the introduced mesoporosity, intrinsic microporosity, and the connectivity of the additional pores. The design of such materials aims to maximize the catalytic efficiency while minimizing the energy and raw material requirements, contributing to more sustainable and efficient PDH processes.

分层沸石通过将微孔与介孔或大孔结合，提高了PDH反应中的可及性。微孔允许反应物和产物与活性位点相互作用，而介孔和大孔则促进这些分子在材料中的扩散，最小化运输限制。这种孔大小的组合创建了一个层次结构，优化了反应物和产物的捕获和传输，从而提高催化性能。

主要的分层沸石类型包括微介孔结构、微大孔结构和微-介大孔结构。合成方法通常涉及使用直接或间接模板在微沸石骨架中引入介孔或大孔。这些方法可以包括原位合成，在此过程中形成孔隙，或者后合成方法，如去金属化或脱硅化，这些方法在沸石形成之后引入孔隙。

与传统沸石相比，分层沸石在PDH反应中表现出改进的性能，因为它们能够加速质量传输、减少扩散路径长度，并改善活性位点的可及性。这导致增强的催化活性、选择性和寿命，特别是当处理难以通过传统沸石微孔结构传输的大分子或化合物时。

为了针对PDH反应设计这些材料，可以通过优化引入的介孔性、内在微孔性和额外孔隙的连通性来优化平衡。此类材料的设计旨在最大化催化效率，同时最小化能量和原材料需求，为更可持续和高效的PDH过程做出贡献。
