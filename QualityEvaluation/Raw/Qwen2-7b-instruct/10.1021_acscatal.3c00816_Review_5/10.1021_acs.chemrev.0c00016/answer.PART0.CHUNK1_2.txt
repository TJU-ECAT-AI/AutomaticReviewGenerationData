[1] "The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts."
[2] "These materials can be prepared by using a single principle or a combination of two or three principles during the synthesis process."
[3] "Hierarchically porous zeolites are quite desirable for catalysis and other processes."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores or macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by reducing the diffusion path of reactants and improving their access to and escape from the catalytic active sites. This leads to increased reactant conversion and product selectivity, as well as an extended lifetime of the catalyst. These materials can be synthesized using various principles, including crystallization, aggregation, and extraction. They are highly desirable for catalysis and other processes due to their enhanced catalytic properties.

这些材料通过减少反应物的扩散路径并提高其对催化活性位点的访问以及产物的释放，结合微孔和介孔或大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性。这导致反应物转化率和产品选择性的增加，以及催化剂寿命的延长。这些材料可以通过结晶、聚集和提取等多种原理进行合成。由于它们提高了催化性能，因此对于催化和其他过程而言非常有吸引力。
