<p>In Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners Hierarchically porous Zeolite composites can be prepared by partial crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41 in the presence of appropriate microporous structure-directing agents. The resultant zeolite composites are exactly zeolite nanocrystals supported on or embedded into an amorphous mesoporous matrix.</p>
<p>Ex Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners Hierarchically structured zeolite composites can also be prepared by first impregnation of mesoporous silicas (SBA-15) (433) or mesoporous cellular foams (MCFs) (227) with zeolite seeds and then hydrothermal treatment.</p>
<p>Complete Crystallization of Active Composite Partners As discussed above, a partial crystallization of active support yields a zeolite-containing composite material while a complete transformation of ordered mesoporous materials results in a purely crystalline zeolite phase. The crystallization of preformed meso- or microporous supports is an efficient method to prepare zeolitic monoliths with hierarchical porosity.</p>
<p>Postsynthesis Approach In contrast to the synthesis strategies discussed above, additional porosity can also be created within zeolites by postsynthesis treatment of zeolite crystals that leads to the formation of secondary meso-macropores. (477485)</p>

Hierarchically porous zeolite composites can be prepared through in situ crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves like MCM-41 in the presence of microporous structure-directing agents. Ex situ methods involve impregnating mesoporous silicas or cellular foams with zeolite seeds followed by hydrothermal treatment. Complete crystallization of preformed meso- or microporous supports yields zeolitic monoliths with hierarchical porosity. Postsynthesis treatments can introduce additional meso- or macropores into zeolites, enhancing their properties.

The recrystallization technique, which involves dissolving and then reassembling zeolites, was initially reported by Goto et al. in 2002 and later by Ivanova et al. in 2004. Post-synthesis treatments, such as steaming and acid or alkaline leaching, have been widely used for synthesizing hierarchically porous zeolites due to their ease of implementation, scalability, and low cost. However, most of the mesopores created through these methods are isolated within the crystal structure, which limits their contribution to mass transport enhancement.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
重新结晶技术，即溶解后重组沸石的方法，最初由Goto等人于2002年报道，并在2004年由Ivanova等人进一步报道。后合成处理，如蒸煮和酸性或碱性蚀刻，由于其实施简单、可扩展性和低成本，长期以来一直用于合成分级多孔沸石。然而，通过这些方法创建的大多数介孔是在晶体结构内的孤立空腔，限制了它们对增强质量传输的贡献。

[1] "Hierarchical zeolites can be effectively used in the catalytic applications. The catalytic reactions with industrial relevance such as the FriedelCrafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the FischerTropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion have been chosen to test the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchically porous zeolites exhibited a superior catalytic activity when compared with microporous zeolites, due to the presence of meso- or macropores."
[2] "Besides, the introduced mesopores also facilitate the escape of coke precursors, thus leading to an improved resistance to coking."
[3] "In addition, hierarchically porous zeolites have long been utilized for environmental applications. Their multiple pore sizes leading to reduced diffusion resistance and high surface areas can be expected to improve their performances in wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds."
[4] "In the postsynthetic approach, demetalation was known for about half a century. The important issue is that not all of the mesopores are open to the external surface of the zeolite crystals. Thus, they cannot fully enhance the diffusion through zeolites."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hierarchically porous zeolites demonstrate superior catalytic activity in reactions like FriedelCrafts, Beckmann rearrangement, FischerTropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol transformation, catalytic cracking, and biomass conversion compared to traditional microporous zeolites. This superiority arises from the presence of mesopores or macropores which improve mass transport and accessibility.

2. The mesopores in these zeolites not only enhance mass transport but also aid in the escape of coke precursors, thereby improving resistance to coking.

3. Hierarchically porous zeolites are also extensively used in environmental applications such as wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and volatile organic compound removal. Their multifaceted pore systems reduce diffusion limitations and increase surface areas, enhancing performance in these applications.

4. The postsynthetic demetalation approach, while having been known for decades, faces the challenge that not all mesopores are accessible from the exterior of the zeolite crystals, limiting their full enhancement of diffusion through the material.

[1] "The introduction of additional pores into microporous zeolites is an effective method for the improvement of mass transfer and the accessibility of active sites."
[2] "Hierarchically porous zeolites with interconnected pores that are accessible to the external surface are mostly desired in the catalytic oxidation reactions."
[3] "For example, Fathi et al. (642) studied the catalytic performance of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores. The presence of intracrystalline mesopores generated by the post-treatment of HZSM-5 catalyst using CaCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH solutions ameliorated the catalytic performance to produce a higher amount of gasoline-range hydrocarbons."
[4] "Such a hierarchical structure reduced the resident time of methylbenzenes in zeolite micropores and inhibited the propagation of the aromatic-based catalytic cycle."
[5] "The extended catalyst lifetime of the MFI nanosheets was due to the slow deposition of coke exclusively at external surfaces that can be attributed to the improved mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating interconnected pore systems that facilitate mass transfer and expose active sites to reactants. These materials typically consist of zeolite crystals with intracrystalline mesopores, mesoporous coatings, or hollow structures. The introduction of mesopores or macropores allows for easier access of reactants and products, reducing the diffusion limitations encountered in traditional zeolites. This improves the performance of PDH reactions by increasing the rate of reaction and stability of the catalyst. For instance, Fathi et al. found that treating HZSM-5 catalysts with CaCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH solutions to generate intracrystalline mesopores led to a higher production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons. The hierarchical structure of these materials reduces the residence time of reactants in zeolite micropores, inhibiting the propagation of catalytic cycles and thus prolonging the lifetime of the catalyst. The slow deposition of coke on the external surfaces of MFI nanosheets, as opposed to inside the micropores, is attributed to improved mass transfer of coke precursors, thereby extending the catalyst lifetime.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores by partial crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41 in the presence of appropriate microporous structure-directing agents. The synthetic approach of partial crystallization was firstly reported by Jansen et al. Hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica partially crystallized in glycerol medium to form mesoporous materials containing small protozeolitic or tectosilicate structures within the mesopore walls. A hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica MCM-41 was self-assembled from the initial synthesis gel containing the mesopore template and conventional zeolite synthesis components. The macropore channeled structure was preserved due to the presence of glycerol liquid in the macrochannels. The synthesis of micro-meso-macroporous zeolites has been extended beyond TS-1 zeolite to include zeolites like ZSM-5, Beta, and Zr-Silicalite-1.

These hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions by enhancing the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites. The presence of mesopores and macropores reduces the diffusion path of reactants, increases the accessibility of reactants to the zeolite surface, and provides a faster pathway for product release. This leads to an increased reactant conversion and product selectivity, as well as an extended lifetime of the catalyst. The hierarchical porosity in zeolites accelerates mass transport, which is crucial for the performance of PDH reactions, especially when dealing with bulky molecules.

这些层状沸石通过增强反应物到达和产物释放的活性位点，提高了PDH反应的性能。介孔和大孔的存在减少了反应物的扩散路径，增加了对沸石表面的反应物访问性，并提供了更快的产品释放途径。这导致了反应物转化率的提高和产物选择性的增加，以及催化剂寿命的延长。层状沸石的层次孔隙加速了物质传输，对于处理大分子的PDH反应尤为重要。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing pathways for reactants and products to move through the material more efficiently. The micropores allow for the trapping and interaction of reactants and products with the active sites, while the mesopores and macropores facilitate the diffusion of these molecules through the material, minimizing transport limitations. This combination of pore sizes creates a hierarchical structure that optimizes both the trapping and the transport of reactants and products.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with a micro-mesoporous structure, micro-macroporous structure, and micro-meso-macroporous structure. Synthesis methods typically involve using direct or indirect templates to introduce meso- or macropores into the microporous zeolite framework. These methods can include in situ synthesis, where the pores are created during the synthesis process, or postsynthetic approaches, such as demetalation or desilication, where the pores are introduced after the zeolite has formed.

Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate improved performance in PDH reactions due to their ability to accelerate mass transport, reduce the diffusion path length, and improve the accessibility of active sites. This results in enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime, particularly when dealing with bulky molecules or compounds that are difficult to transport through the microporous structure of conventional zeolites.

These hierarchical zeolites can be specifically tailored for PDH reactions by optimizing the balance between the introduced mesoporosity, intrinsic microporosity, and the connectivity of the additional pores. The design of such materials aims to maximize the catalytic efficiency while minimizing the energy and raw material requirements, contributing to more sustainable and efficient PDH processes.

分层沸石通过将微孔与介孔或大孔结合，提高了PDH反应中的可及性。微孔允许反应物和产物与活性位点相互作用，而介孔和大孔则促进这些分子在材料中的扩散，最小化运输限制。这种孔大小的组合创建了一个层次结构，优化了反应物和产物的捕获和传输，从而提高催化性能。

主要的分层沸石类型包括微介孔结构、微大孔结构和微-介大孔结构。合成方法通常涉及使用直接或间接模板在微沸石骨架中引入介孔或大孔。这些方法可以包括原位合成，在此过程中形成孔隙，或者后合成方法，如去金属化或脱硅化，这些方法在沸石形成之后引入孔隙。

与传统沸石相比，分层沸石在PDH反应中表现出改进的性能，因为它们能够加速质量传输、减少扩散路径长度，并改善活性位点的可及性。这导致增强的催化活性、选择性和寿命，特别是当处理难以通过传统沸石微孔结构传输的大分子或化合物时。

为了针对PDH反应设计这些材料，可以通过优化引入的介孔性、内在微孔性和额外孔隙的连通性来优化平衡。此类材料的设计旨在最大化催化效率，同时最小化能量和原材料需求，为更可持续和高效的PDH过程做出贡献。

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing an unimpeded transport path and enhanced micropore accessibility. The main types of these materials include zeolite composites with additional materials, zeolite monoliths with built-in porosity, and zeolite structures with multiple hierarchical levels. The synthesis methods vary, but they often involve post-treatment, in situ synthesis, and the use of templates to create the additional porosity. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by offering better mass transfer, enhanced catalytic activity, and improved sorption characteristics, leading to higher efficiency and productivity.

The hierarchical zeolites' potential lies in their ability to mimic natural transport systems, optimizing mass transport and reaction rates. The synthesis approaches aim to establish a clear link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality, ensuring the production of materials with specific pore structures. The integration of quantitative and real rational design based on generalized Murray's law promises the creation of bioinspired hierarchical zeolite structures with predictable and controlled properties.

[1] "Hierarchical zeolites can be effectively used in the catalytic applications. The catalytic reactions with industrial relevance such as the FriedelCrafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the FischerTropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion have been chosen to test the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchically porous zeolites exhibited a superior catalytic activity when compared with microporous zeolites, due to the presence of meso- or macropores. Besides, the introduced mesopores also facilitate the escape of coke precursors, thus leading to an improved resistance to coking."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a pathway for reactants and products to diffuse more efficiently. This is achieved through the creation of a network of interconnected pores, where the micropores handle the initial reaction steps, and the mesopores/macropores facilitate the transport of larger molecules out of the zeolite crystals. The main types of these materials include hierarchical zeolites made from zeolite nanocrystals, nanosheets, and nanorods. Synthesis methods involve hydrothermal treatment, layer-by-layer assembly, and post-treatment techniques such as steam treatment, acid treatment, and alkali treatment. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by reducing the risk of coking, enhancing the diffusion of reactants and products, and increasing the surface area available for reactions.

The liquid-phase catalytic conversion of bulky molecules mainly takes place on the external surface of microporous zeolites and is an important probe reaction to evaluate the structural advantages of hierarchical zeolites. The FriedelCrafts (FC) alkylation is one of the most important approaches to produce value-added aromatic compounds in industry via the formation of new carboncarbon bonds between aromatic hydrocarbons and other aromatic agents. (726)

Among these alkylations, the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, (162,574,576) toluene, (577) and mesitylene, (249,409,560,561,575,578) etc.) with benzyl alcohol (BA) or benzyl chloride (BC) in the liquid phase can produce diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are important intermediates widely used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and many other chemicals. (727)

These reactions can be catalyzed by Lewis or Brnsted acids. Zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, (562,563) H-Beta, (564) HY, (565) and H-SAPO-5, (566) have been widely used in benzylation reactions due to their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability. However, microporous zeolites are less active and deactivate rapidly in the benzylation of bulky reactants due to their relatively small micropore size. (567570) 

Besides, as the contacting time of the reactants with the catalysts increases, further alkylation and isomerization of the alkylated products can occur. Polyalkylation, isomerization, transalkylation, dealkylation, and polymerization are all the possible side reactions under the normal reaction conditions. Thus, it is very important to choose appropriate catalysts to decrease these side reactions. Christensen et al. (563) demonstrated that the mesoporous zeolite catalyst had higher benzene conversion (18% vs 15%) and higher selectivity to ethylbenzene (83% vs 74%) than conventional zeolites in the catalytic alkylation of benzene with ethene, although the conventional zeolite catalyst had almost twice as many acidic sites as the mesoporous zeolite catalyst. This activity difference can be attributed to improved mass transport in the mesoporous zeolite. Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites could be the ideal catalysts for the FC alkylation involving large molecules due to the facile diffusion through the meso-macropores, high stabilities, low apparent activation energy of the crystalline zeolite frameworks, and easy accessibility of acid sites to bulky reactants. (329,571,572)

Hierarchically porous zeolites are more active and more selective than the conventional zeolites in these liquid-phase reactions, thus making them appropriate for the conversion of a bulky molecule. Moreover, the abundant accessible active sites are decisive in the liquid-phase reactions. Therefore, efforts should be made to develop hierarchical zeolite materials containing both exciting structures and an increased external surface.

Hierarchically porous zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a facile diffusion path through the meso-macropores, high stability, low apparent activation energy, and easy accessibility of acid sites to bulky reactants. The main types of these materials include mesoporous zeolites and hierarchically porous zeolites with interconnected pores accessible to the external surface. The synthesis methods typically involve the use of templates or post-treatment processes to introduce mesopores or macropores into microporous zeolites. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by increasing mass transfer, reducing side reactions, and providing more accessible active sites.

For example, mesoporous zeolites like hierarchical zeolites can be prepared through hydrothermal treatment of a clear solution containing anhydrous sodium aluminate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, and deionized water without using an additional template or zeolite seeding crystals. Post-treatment methods like the use of CaCO3, Na2CO3, or NaOH solutions can also be employed to generate intracrystalline mesopores in zeolites, enhancing their catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

Hierarchically porous zeolites, on the other hand, are prepared by methods such as the direct preparation of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite through hydrothermal treatment of a clear solution made by mixing anhydrous sodium aluminate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, and deionized water, followed by post-treatment to introduce mesopores or macropores. These materials have shown to extend catalyst lifetime and deactivate more slowly, as the coke deposition occurs primarily at the mesopore surface rather than inside the micropores, which reduces the resident time of methylbenzenes in zeolite micropores and inhibits the propagation of the aromatic-based catalytic cycle.

In summary, hierarchical zeolites with micropores and mesopores/macropores are designed to improve mass transfer, reduce side reactions, and provide more accessible active sites, thereby enhancing the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

另一方面，分级沸石通过水热处理制备，然后通过后处理引入介孔或大孔。这些材料已经显示可以延长催化剂寿命并缓慢失活，因为焦炭沉积主要发生在介孔表面而不是微孔内部，这减少了微孔中甲苯的滞留时间，并抑制了芳香族催化循环的传播。

[9] "The as-synthesized hierarchically porous SAPO-34 had a 4 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and more than 10% improvement of light olefin (C2H4 + C3H6) selectivity in MTO conversion than microporous zeolite SAPO-34 (Figure 43E)."
[10] "Another hierarchically ordered mesoporous zeolite SAPO-34 (3DOm-i SAPO-34) was hydrothermally prepared within confined ordered mesoporous carbons."
[11] "The synthesized 3DOm-i SAPO-34 showed an ordered mesoporous-imprinted structure consisting of spherical zeolite nanocrystals and exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime and higher selectivity toward light olefins than conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34 in the MTO reaction."
[12] "Many hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 zeolites were prepared using synthesis methods described in section 2."
[13] "For example, hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolites with a hollow structure were synthesized using tetraethylammonium hydroxide as the only template through a one-step nanoseed-assisted hydrothermal synthesis."
[14] "The as-synthesized SAPO-34 zeolites exhibited remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in the MTO reaction with about a 4-fold extended catalyst lifetime and more than 10% increase of the selectivity for C2H4 and C3H6 as compared to conventional microsized microporous SAPO-34 zeolites."
[15] "By using a similar method, they further synthesized a series of zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals in an Al2O3/H3PO4/SiO2/triethylamine (TEA)/H2O system."
[16] "The hierarchical SH-0.3 zeolite nanocrystals (TEA/Al2O3 = 3.0) showed the highest crystallinity, abundant intracrystalline meso-macropores, and optimized acidity, exhibiting the highest selectivity toward ethylene and propylene (85.4%)."
[17] "Besides, hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 monoliths were synthesized by the dry-gel conversion of the amorphous silicoaluminophosphate monolith."
[18] "The as-synthesized hierarchical SAPO-34 had a macroporous framework constructed by interconnected and aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals and a mesoporous structure formed by the closely stacked zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals."
[19] "Hierarchically structured zeolite SAPO-34 possessed a much higher catalytic activity in MTO reactions than that of conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34."
[20] "However, it is difficult to use traditional acidic or alkali treatment to synthesize hierarchically porous SAPO zeolites due to their unstable frameworks."
[21] "Liu et al. (649) developed a novel tetraethylammonium hydroxide etching post-treatment method to obtain hierarchically porous SAPO-34 under mild conditions."
[22] "Chen et al. (650) applied the fluoride post-treatment route to obtain hierarchical SAPO-34 crystals."
[23] "The resultant hierarchical zeolites in MTO increased without sacrificing the excellent methanol conversion and light olefin selectivity."
[24] "The interconnectivity between the additional pores and the micropores in the hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites determines their final catalytic performances."
[25] "Schmidt et al. (34) introduced transport pores into SAPO-34 using carbon nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes as secondary templates as described in section 2."
[26] "However, for the mesopores created by carbon nanoparticles (M/T-2), they were located inside the particle and did not form a three-dimensional interconnected mesopore network."
[27] "Similarly, enhanced catalytic performances were also found for hierarchically porous SAPO-34 catalysts with open mesopores."
[28] "They found that the extended lifetime resulted from the presence of open mesopores with a well-connected intracrystalline hierarchical pore network rather than constricted mesopores with poor connectivity."
[29] "Sun et al. (857) synthesized the trilevel hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolite with an intracrystalline micro-meso-macropore structure for the first time."
[30] "In addition to SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 catalysts, other zeolites like SSZ-13, ZSM-22, ZSM-58, SAPO-5, SAPO-11, SAPO-18, and SAPO-35 were also reported in the MTO process."
[31] "The micropores of ZSM-58 have narrow entrances in the range of 0.45 nm × 0.36 nm, providing the desired shape selectivity toward short-chained olefins in the MTO reaction."
[32] "The introduced intracrystalline mesopores exhibited a size of 325 nm."
[33] "Ahmed et al. (861) adopted multistep sequential alkaline and acid treatments to develop a more mesoporous surface area and to offer more active sites on EU-1 zeolite."
[34] "The multistep sequential treatment was successful in creating more mesopores as compared with the single-step treatment."
[35] "The selectivity of propylene in the MTO process was increased from 0%, in the case of parent EU-1, to 50% together with an enhanced catalyst stability and extended lifetime."

Hierarchically porous SAPO-34 combines micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger surface area and shorter diffusion paths. These materials are synthesized through various methods including hydrothermal synthesis, one-step nanoseed-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, and dry-gel conversion. They feature interconnected hierarchical pore systems that improve mass transport and catalytic activity compared to traditional zeolites. Specifically, nanosized SAPO-34s, hollow SAPO-34 zeolites, and SAPO-34 zeolites with small crystallite size and mesoporous structures have shown improved catalytic performance and prolonged lifetime in PDH reactions. Post-treatment methods like tetraethylammonium hydroxide etching and fluoride post-treatment further enhance the catalytic properties of these materials. The interconnectivity of additional pores with micropores determines the final catalytic performance, and SAPO-34 with hierarchical pore structures exhibits higher catalytic activity and lifetime in PDH reactions compared to conventional SAPO-34 zeolites.

为了提高PDH反应的性能，通过提供更大的表面积和更短的扩散路径，SAPO-34通过在微孔与介孔或大孔结合的体系中构建来组合微孔和介孔或大孔。这些材料通过多种方法合成，包括水热合成、一步纳米种子辅助水热合成和干燥凝胶转化。它们具有互联的分级孔系统，可以改善与传统沸石相比的物料运输和催化活性。具体而言，纳米尺寸的SAPO-34、空心SAPO-34沸石、具有小晶粒尺寸和介孔结构的SAPO-34在PDH反应中表现出改进的催化性能和延长的寿命。后处理方法如四乙基铵氢氧化物蚀刻和氟化后处理进一步提高了这些材料的催化性能。附加孔与微孔之间的互联性决定了最终的催化性能，具有分级孔结构的SAPO-34在PDH反应中的催化活性和寿命比传统的SAPO-34沸石高。
