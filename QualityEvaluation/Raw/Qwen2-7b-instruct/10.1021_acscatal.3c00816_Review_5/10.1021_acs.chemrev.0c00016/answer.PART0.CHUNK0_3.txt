[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."
[2] "These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests."
[3] "Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis, characterization, and application of hierarchical zeolites."
[4] "Another essential merit of the hierarchical structure in zeolite materials is that it can significantly improve the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials resulting in the minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption."
[5] "These classes of organisms among both plants and animals contain hierarchical networks of interconnected pores to maximize the mass transport and increase the rates of reactions for optimal efficiency and least energy consumption."
[6] "Importantly, the synthesized hierarchically porous zeolites should retain a high zeolitic character; i.e., the additional porosities are introduced without impairing the intrinsic zeolite micropores."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites integrate the catalytic properties of microporous zeolites with the enhanced transport capabilities of mesopores and macropores. They are crucial for industrial catalysts and sorbents, offering improved efficiency and minimal resource consumption. These materials mimic the hierarchical pore systems found in nature, enhancing mass transport and reaction rates for optimal performance. Crucially, they maintain their zeolitic character, ensuring that the additional porosities do not compromise the intrinsic microporosity.
