[1] "The introduction of additional pores into microporous zeolites is an effective method for the improvement of mass transfer and the accessibility of active sites."
[2] "Hierarchically porous zeolites with interconnected pores that are accessible to the external surface are mostly desired in the catalytic oxidation reactions."
[3] "For example, Fathi et al. (642) studied the catalytic performance of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores. The presence of intracrystalline mesopores generated by the post-treatment of HZSM-5 catalyst using CaCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH solutions ameliorated the catalytic performance to produce a higher amount of gasoline-range hydrocarbons."
[4] "Such a hierarchical structure reduced the resident time of methylbenzenes in zeolite micropores and inhibited the propagation of the aromatic-based catalytic cycle."
[5] "The extended catalyst lifetime of the MFI nanosheets was due to the slow deposition of coke exclusively at external surfaces that can be attributed to the improved mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating interconnected pore systems that facilitate mass transfer and expose active sites to reactants. These materials typically consist of zeolite crystals with intracrystalline mesopores, mesoporous coatings, or hollow structures. The introduction of mesopores or macropores allows for easier access of reactants and products, reducing the diffusion limitations encountered in traditional zeolites. This improves the performance of PDH reactions by increasing the rate of reaction and stability of the catalyst. For instance, Fathi et al. found that treating HZSM-5 catalysts with CaCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH solutions to generate intracrystalline mesopores led to a higher production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons. The hierarchical structure of these materials reduces the residence time of reactants in zeolite micropores, inhibiting the propagation of catalytic cycles and thus prolonging the lifetime of the catalyst. The slow deposition of coke on the external surfaces of MFI nanosheets, as opposed to inside the micropores, is attributed to improved mass transfer of coke precursors, thereby extending the catalyst lifetime.

对于PDH反应，层状沸石通过创建互联孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而提高可接近性。这些材料通常由具有内晶间介孔的沸石晶体组成，介孔涂层或空心结构。引入介孔或大孔允许更轻松地访问反应物和产物，减少了在传统沸石中遇到的扩散限制。这通过增加反应速率和催化剂稳定性改善了PDH反应性能。例如，Fathi等人发现，通过CaCO3、Na2CO3和NaOH溶液处理HZSM-5催化剂以生成内晶间介孔，可以产生更多的汽油范围烃类。这些材料的层级结构减少了反应物在微孔中的停留时间，抑制了催化循环的传播，从而延长了催化剂的寿命。MFI纳米片上的焦炭沉积速度较慢，主要发生在外部表面，这是由于焦炭前体的转移得到改善，从而延长了催化剂的使用寿命。
