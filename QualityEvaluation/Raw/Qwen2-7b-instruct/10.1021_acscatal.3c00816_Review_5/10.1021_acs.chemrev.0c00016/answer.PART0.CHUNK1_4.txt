[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, which are catalyzed by zeolites."
[2] "These materials can be prepared through in situ templating, postsynthesis treatment, or a combination of both methods."
[3] "The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites accelerates mass transport, reduces diffusion paths, and improves reactant access to and product escape from the active sites, thus enhancing catalytic performance."
[4] "Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced mass transport properties and increased surface area."

1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores or macropores to boost accessibility for PDH reactions, which are catalyzed by zeolites.
2. These materials can be synthesized using in situ templating, postsynthesis treatment, or a blend of both methodologies.
3. By adding meso- or macropores to microporous zeolites, mass transport is accelerated, diffusion paths are shortened, and reactants gain better access to and products can easily escape from the active sites, thereby enhancing catalytic efficiency.
4. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites exhibit superior performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced mass transport properties and increased surface area.

1. 层级沸石结合微孔和介孔或大孔，以增强PDH反应的可接近性，这些反应由沸石催化。
2. 这些材料可以通过原位模板法、后合成处理或两者的结合来制备。
3. 在微孔沸石中添加介孔或大孔可以加速物质传输，缩短扩散路径，并使反应物更好地接触并使产物容易逸出活性位点，从而提高催化性能。
4. 相比传统沸石，层级沸石在PDH反应中的表现更优，这归功于其增强的物质传输特性和增加的表面积。
