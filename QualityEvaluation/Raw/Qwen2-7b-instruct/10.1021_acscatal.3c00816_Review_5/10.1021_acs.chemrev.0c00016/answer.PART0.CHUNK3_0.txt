[1] "Hierarchical zeolites can be effectively used in the catalytic applications. The catalytic reactions with industrial relevance such as the FriedelCrafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the FischerTropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion have been chosen to test the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchically porous zeolites exhibited a superior catalytic activity when compared with microporous zeolites, due to the presence of meso- or macropores."
[2] "Besides, the introduced mesopores also facilitate the escape of coke precursors, thus leading to an improved resistance to coking."
[3] "In addition, hierarchically porous zeolites have long been utilized for environmental applications. Their multiple pore sizes leading to reduced diffusion resistance and high surface areas can be expected to improve their performances in wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds."
[4] "In the postsynthetic approach, demetalation was known for about half a century. The important issue is that not all of the mesopores are open to the external surface of the zeolite crystals. Thus, they cannot fully enhance the diffusion through zeolites."

1. Hierarchically porous zeolites demonstrate superior catalytic activity in reactions like FriedelCrafts, Beckmann rearrangement, FischerTropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol transformation, catalytic cracking, and biomass conversion compared to traditional microporous zeolites. This superiority arises from the presence of mesopores or macropores which improve mass transport and accessibility.

2. The mesopores in these zeolites not only enhance mass transport but also aid in the escape of coke precursors, thereby improving resistance to coking.

3. Hierarchically porous zeolites are also extensively used in environmental applications such as wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and volatile organic compound removal. Their multifaceted pore systems reduce diffusion limitations and increase surface areas, enhancing performance in these applications.

4. The postsynthetic demetalation approach, while having been known for decades, faces the challenge that not all mesopores are accessible from the exterior of the zeolite crystals, limiting their full enhancement of diffusion through the material.

1. 层状孔沸石在如费歇尔-科特反应、贝克曼重排、福斯切-特罗普希合成过程、氢化过程、氧化反应、甲醇转化、催化裂解和生物基材料转换等工业相关反应中表现出优于传统微孔沸石的催化活性。这种优势来自于微孔或大孔的存在，它们可以改善物质传输和活性位点的可达性。

2. 这些沸石中的微孔不仅增强了物质传输，还能促进焦炭前体的逃逸，从而提高了对焦炭形成的抵抗力。

3. 层状孔沸石还在废水处理、吸附脱硫、二氧化碳捕获和挥发性有机化合物去除等环境应用中得到广泛应用。其多级孔系统减少了扩散限制并增加了表面积，从而提高了这些应用中的性能。

4. 而后合成的去金属化方法，虽然已经存在几十年，但面临的问题是，并非所有微孔都能从沸石晶体的外部访问，这限制了其通过材料的完全扩散增强。
