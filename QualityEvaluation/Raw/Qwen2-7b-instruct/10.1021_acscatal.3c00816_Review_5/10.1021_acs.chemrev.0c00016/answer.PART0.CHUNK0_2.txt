1. Hierarchical zeolites merge the catalytic properties of microporous zeolites with the enhanced access and transport provided by meso- and/or macroporous systems. They are highly sought-after catalysts and adsorbents in industry, representing a rapidly advancing field of significant current interest. Beyond boosting activity, selectivity, and cycle time, the hierarchical structure notably improves the utilization efficiency of zeolites, minimizing energy, time, and raw materials usage. Much advancement has been made in the synthesis, characterization, and application of hierarchical zeolites. These materials were typically produced through a straightforward one-step hydrothermal crystallization process.

2. Hierarchical zeolites with meso-macroporous structures can enhance the performance of PDH reactions by providing an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores). This allows for more efficient mass transfer and reagent access, ultimately improving the overall catalytic efficiency.
