[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."
[2] "These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests. In addition to the enhanced mass transfer leading to high activity, selectivity, and cycle time, another essential merit of the hierarchical structure in zeolite materials is that it can significantly improve the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials resulting in the minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption."
[3] "Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis, characterization, and application of hierarchical zeolites."
[4] "Zeolites with different hierarchically porous structures, i.e., micro-mesoporous structure, micro-macroporous structure, and micro-meso-macroporous structure, are then analyzed in detail with concrete examples to illustrate their benefits and their fabrications."
[5] "The most innovative synthesis approaches are reviewed according to the principle, versatility, effectiveness, and degree of reality while establishing a firm link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality in zeolites."

Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores with mesopores or macropores to enhance accessibility and transport, making them ideal for industrial catalysts and sorbents. This structure improves mass transfer, leading to higher activity, selectivity, and cycle time. It also optimizes the utilization of zeolite materials, minimizing energy, time, and raw materials consumption. Progress has been made in synthesizing, characterizing, and applying hierarchical zeolites. Detailed analysis of zeolites with different hierarchical porous structures demonstrates their benefits and fabrication methods. Innovative synthesis techniques are evaluated based on their principles, versatility, effectiveness, and reality, linking preparation routes to the resulting pore quality in zeolites.
