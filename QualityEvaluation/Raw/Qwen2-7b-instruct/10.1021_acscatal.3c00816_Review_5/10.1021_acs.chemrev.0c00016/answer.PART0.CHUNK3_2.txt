[1] "Hierarchical zeolites can be effectively used in the catalytic applications. The catalytic reactions with industrial relevance such as the FriedelCrafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the FischerTropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion have been chosen to test the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchically porous zeolites exhibited a superior catalytic activity when compared with microporous zeolites, due to the presence of meso- or macropores. Besides, the introduced mesopores also facilitate the escape of coke precursors, thus leading to an improved resistance to coking."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores or macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a shorter diffusion path for reactants and products. This is achieved through the introduction of mesopores or macropores into the microporous structure of zeolites. These additional pores allow for more efficient mass transport and improved accessibility to active sites, leading to enhanced performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The mesopores facilitate the escape of coke precursors, thereby improving resistance to coking.

层状沸石通过在微孔结构中引入介孔或大孔，结合微孔和介孔或大孔，以增强PDH反应的可访问性。这通过提供更短的扩散路径以及反应物和产物的高效传输来实现。这些额外的孔隙允许更高效的物质传输并提高活性位点的可接近性，从而在PDH反应中与传统沸石相比表现出增强的性能。介孔有助于炭前体的逸出，从而提高抗结焦能力。

[1] "In the postsynthetic approach, demetalation was known for about half a century. The important issue is that not all of the mesopores are open to the external surface of the zeolite crystals. Thus, they cannot fully enhance the diffusion through zeolites."

In the postsynthetic approach, demetalation has been known for approximately half a century. However, a key issue is that not all the mesopores are accessible to the exterior surface of the zeolite crystals. Consequently, they do not fully promote diffusion enhancement through the zeolites.
