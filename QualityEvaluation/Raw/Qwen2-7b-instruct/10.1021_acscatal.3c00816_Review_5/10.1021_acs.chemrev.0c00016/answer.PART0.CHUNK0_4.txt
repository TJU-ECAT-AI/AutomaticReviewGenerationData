[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."
[2] "These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests."
[3] "Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis, characterization, and application of hierarchical zeolites."
[4] "Zeolites with different hierarchically porous structures, i.e., micro-mesoporous structure, micro-macroporous structure, and micro-meso-macroporous structure, are then analyzed in detail with concrete examples to illustrate their benefits and their fabrications."
[5] "The most innovative synthesis approaches are reviewed according to the principle, versatility, effectiveness, and degree of reality while establishing a firm link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality in zeolites."
