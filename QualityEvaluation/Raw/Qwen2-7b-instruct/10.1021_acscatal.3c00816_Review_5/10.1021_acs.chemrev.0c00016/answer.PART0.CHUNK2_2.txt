The liquid-phase catalytic conversion of bulky molecules mainly takes place on the external surface of microporous zeolites and is an important probe reaction to evaluate the structural advantages of hierarchical zeolites. The FriedelCrafts (FC) alkylation is one of the most important approaches to produce value-added aromatic compounds in industry via the formation of new carboncarbon bonds between aromatic hydrocarbons and other aromatic agents.

Integrating additional pores into microporous zeolites is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent diffusion limitations and improve the utilization of zeolites.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a pathway for reactants and products to diffuse more efficiently. This is achieved through the creation of a network of interconnected pores, where the micropores handle the initial reaction steps, and the mesopores/macropores facilitate the transport of larger molecules out of the zeolite crystals. The main types of these materials include hierarchical zeolites made from zeolite nanocrystals, nanosheets, and nanorods. Synthesis methods involve hydrothermal treatment, layer-by-layer assembly, and post-treatment techniques such as steam treatment, acid treatment, and alkali treatment. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by reducing the risk of coking, enhancing the diffusion of reactants and products, and increasing the surface area available for reactions.

分层沸石结合微孔和介孔或大孔，通过提供反应物和产物扩散更高效的方式增强了PDH反应的可及性。这通过创建互连孔网络实现，其中微孔处理初始反应步骤，而介孔或大孔促进更大分子从沸石晶体的运输。这些材料的主要类型包括由沸石纳米晶、纳米片和纳米棒制成的分层沸石。合成方法涉及水热处理、逐层组装和后处理技术，如蒸汽处理、酸处理和碱处理。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过降低结焦的风险、增强反应物和产物的扩散以及增加可用于反应的表面积来提高PDH反应性能。
