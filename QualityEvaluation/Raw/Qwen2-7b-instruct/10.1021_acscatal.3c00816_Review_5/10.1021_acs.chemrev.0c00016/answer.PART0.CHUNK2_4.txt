The liquid-phase catalytic conversion of bulky molecules mainly takes place on the external surface of microporous zeolites and is an important probe reaction to evaluate the structural advantages of hierarchical zeolites. The FriedelCrafts (FC) alkylation is one of the most important approaches to produce value-added aromatic compounds in industry via the formation of new carboncarbon bonds between aromatic hydrocarbons and other aromatic agents. (726)

Among these alkylations, the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, (162,574,576) toluene, (577) and mesitylene, (249,409,560,561,575,578) etc.) with benzyl alcohol (BA) or benzyl chloride (BC) in the liquid phase can produce diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are important intermediates widely used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and many other chemicals. (727)

These reactions can be catalyzed by Lewis or Brnsted acids. Zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, (562,563) H-Beta, (564) HY, (565) and H-SAPO-5, (566) have been widely used in benzylation reactions due to their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability. However, microporous zeolites are less active and deactivate rapidly in the benzylation of bulky reactants due to their relatively small micropore size. (567570) 

Besides, as the contacting time of the reactants with the catalysts increases, further alkylation and isomerization of the alkylated products can occur. Polyalkylation, isomerization, transalkylation, dealkylation, and polymerization are all the possible side reactions under the normal reaction conditions. Thus, it is very important to choose appropriate catalysts to decrease these side reactions. Christensen et al. (563) demonstrated that the mesoporous zeolite catalyst had higher benzene conversion (18% vs 15%) and higher selectivity to ethylbenzene (83% vs 74%) than conventional zeolites in the catalytic alkylation of benzene with ethene, although the conventional zeolite catalyst had almost twice as many acidic sites as the mesoporous zeolite catalyst. This activity difference can be attributed to improved mass transport in the mesoporous zeolite. Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites could be the ideal catalysts for the FC alkylation involving large molecules due to the facile diffusion through the meso-macropores, high stabilities, low apparent activation energy of the crystalline zeolite frameworks, and easy accessibility of acid sites to bulky reactants. (329,571,572)

Hierarchically porous zeolites are more active and more selective than the conventional zeolites in these liquid-phase reactions, thus making them appropriate for the conversion of a bulky molecule. Moreover, the abundant accessible active sites are decisive in the liquid-phase reactions. Therefore, efforts should be made to develop hierarchical zeolite materials containing both exciting structures and an increased external surface.

Hierarchically porous zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a facile diffusion path through the meso-macropores, high stability, low apparent activation energy, and easy accessibility of acid sites to bulky reactants. The main types of these materials include mesoporous zeolites and hierarchically porous zeolites with interconnected pores accessible to the external surface. The synthesis methods typically involve the use of templates or post-treatment processes to introduce mesopores or macropores into microporous zeolites. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by increasing mass transfer, reducing side reactions, and providing more accessible active sites.

For example, mesoporous zeolites like hierarchical zeolites can be prepared through hydrothermal treatment of a clear solution containing anhydrous sodium aluminate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, and deionized water without using an additional template or zeolite seeding crystals. Post-treatment methods like the use of CaCO3, Na2CO3, or NaOH solutions can also be employed to generate intracrystalline mesopores in zeolites, enhancing their catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

Hierarchically porous zeolites, on the other hand, are prepared by methods such as the direct preparation of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite through hydrothermal treatment of a clear solution made by mixing anhydrous sodium aluminate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, and deionized water, followed by post-treatment to introduce mesopores or macropores. These materials have shown to extend catalyst lifetime and deactivate more slowly, as the coke deposition occurs primarily at the mesopore surface rather than inside the micropores, which reduces the resident time of methylbenzenes in zeolite micropores and inhibits the propagation of the aromatic-based catalytic cycle.

In summary, hierarchical zeolites with micropores and mesopores/macropores are designed to improve mass transfer, reduce side reactions, and provide more accessible active sites, thereby enhancing the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

这些材料主要包括介孔型和具有互联孔结构可直接访问外部表面的分级沸石。合成方法通常涉及使用模板或后处理过程在微孔沸石中引入介孔或大孔。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过增加质量传输、减少副反应并提供更多的活性位点来改善PDH反应性能。

例如，介孔沸石如分级沸石可以通过将无水氢氧化钠铝酸盐、四乙氧基硅烷、四丙基铵氢氧化物和去离子水混合制成的清晰溶液进行水热处理来制备，无需额外的模板或沸石种子晶体。后处理方法，如使用CaCO3、Na2CO3或NaOH溶液，也可以用于在沸石中生成内部介孔，从而增强其PDH反应的催化性能。

另一方面，分级沸石通过水热处理制备，然后通过后处理引入介孔或大孔。这些材料已经显示可以延长催化剂寿命并缓慢失活，因为焦炭沉积主要发生在介孔表面而不是微孔内部，这减少了微孔中甲苯的滞留时间，并抑制了芳香族催化循环的传播。

总之，包含微孔和介孔或大孔的分级沸石旨在改善质量传输、减少副反应并提供更多的活性位点，从而增强PDH反应性能与传统沸石相比。
