[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."
[4] "The majority of propylene production is obtained as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [1,2]."
[5] "The reason for this increase in cracked product selectivity relates to the fact that the Al2O3 support composes of the high amount of acid sites as shown in NH3-TPD results (see Figure S3), resulting in the promotion of cracking reaction."
[6] "The silanol surfaces or defect sites of hierarchical zeolite nanosheets can be greatly enhanced compared to the conventional silicalite-1, eventually resulting in enhancing the interaction of metal and support, thus preventing the aggregation of Pt clusters (Scheme 1)."
[7] "This relates to the fact that the silanol surfaces or defect sites of hierarchical zeolite nanosheets can be greatly enhanced compared to the conventional silicalite-1, eventually resulting in enhancing the interaction of metal and support, thus preventing the aggregation of Pt clusters (Scheme 1)."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is considered the most economical and efficient method for propylene production. It involves converting propane into propylene through a chemical reaction, which has been developed through various licensed processes, including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP).

2. Propane dehydrogenation is among the key technologies for producing propylene from alternative substrates, alongside methanol-to-olefin (MTO), ethylene and butylene metathesis, and other processes. Its development is driven by the growing demand for propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources.

3. The challenge in propane dehydrogenation lies in developing catalysts that offer high selectivity and stability under severe industrial operating conditions.

4. Most propylene is typically produced as a byproduct during steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons.

5. The increased selectivity to cracked products over the alumina support is due to its high concentration of acidic sites, which promotes cracking reactions.

6. Hierarchical zeolite nanosheets enhance the interaction between metal and support by providing more defect sites and silanol surfaces. This prevents the aggregation of Pt clusters, improving the catalyst's performance.

7. Hierarchical zeolite nanosheets enhance the interaction between metal and support by providing more defect sites and silanol surfaces. This prevents the aggregation of Pt clusters, improving the catalyst's performance.

8. The high selectivity to cracked products over the alumina support is attributed to its high acidic site concentration, which accelerates cracking reactions.

[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]."
[3] "However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]. To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]."
[4] "In addition, its catalytic performance will be discussed in terms of the roles of metal-support interaction and acidity."
[5] "The textural properties of all catalysts were measured using N2 sorption measurements as presented in Figure 1H and Table 1."
[6] "Considering the siliceous zeolite, the silicalite-1 nanosheets showed a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."
[7] "Interestingly, in the case of Pt supported on silicalite-1 nanosheets, another reduction peak at higher temperature of 500 C was observed. It is therefore reasonable to imply that there are some Pt species having a strong interaction with support due to the hierarchical structure, resulting in the higher resistance towards the reduction of Pt species."
[8] "The large number of weak acid sites of Pt supported silicalite-1 nanosheets remarkably increased (1.17 and 0.03 mmol·g1, for silicalite-1 nanosheets and the conventional silicalite-1, respectively), implying an increase in the surface silanol density due to the hierarchical structures."
[9] "These observations confirmed the improved interaction of metal-support in the presence of defects or silanol surfaces of the Pt supported on silicalite-1 nanosheet."
[10] "It was also found that a small amount of methane and ethane derived from catalytic cracking was observed."
[11] "In strong contrast to this, the Pt supported catalyst exhibited the selectivity of propylene about 95.2%, although the low Pt loading of 0.5 wt.% was used."
[12] "In addition, the electronic properties of Pt over different supports were also changed. The negative charge of Pt over the Pt4/Q3-MFI model is relatively larger than that of the Pt4/Q4-MFI model, suggesting that the silanol groups can promote the electron transfer from the supports to Pt cluster."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger number of defect sites and increasing the dispersion of metal species. This is achieved through the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network, which improves the dispersion of metal species. The hierarchical structures of these materials allow for improved catalytic efficiency in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, particularly in processes involving bulky molecules like hydroisomerization, aromatization, and hydrodesulfurization. The presence of meso- and macroporosity increases the total pore volume, which facilitates better access to the active sites on the catalyst. Additionally, the hierarchical structure prevents metal aggregation, maintaining a high level of dispersion and reducing the risk of side reactions such as oligomerization. The silanol surfaces or defect sites on the hierarchical zeolite nanosheets enhance the interaction between metal and support, preventing the aggregation of Pt clusters. This results in a catalyst that is highly selective for propylene production from propane dehydrogenation, with improved performance and stability compared to conventional zeolites. The enhanced dispersion of metal nanoparticles on the zeolite nanosheets also contributes to better metal dispersion and complements the development of well-dispersed metallic nanoparticles in PDH reactions.
