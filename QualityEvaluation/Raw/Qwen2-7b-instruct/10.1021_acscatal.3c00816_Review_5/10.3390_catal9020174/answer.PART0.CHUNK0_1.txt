[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]."
[3] "However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]. To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]."
[4] "In addition, its catalytic performance will be discussed in terms of the roles of metal-support interaction and acidity."
[5] "The textural properties of all catalysts were measured using N2 sorption measurements as presented in Figure 1H and Table 1."
[6] "Considering the siliceous zeolite, the silicalite-1 nanosheets showed a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."
[7] "Interestingly, in the case of Pt supported on silicalite-1 nanosheets, another reduction peak at higher temperature of 500 C was observed. It is therefore reasonable to imply that there are some Pt species having a strong interaction with support due to the hierarchical structure, resulting in the higher resistance towards the reduction of Pt species."
[8] "The large number of weak acid sites of Pt supported silicalite-1 nanosheets remarkably increased (1.17 and 0.03 mmol·g1, for silicalite-1 nanosheets and the conventional silicalite-1, respectively), implying an increase in the surface silanol density due to the hierarchical structures."
[9] "These observations confirmed the improved interaction of metal-support in the presence of defects or silanol surfaces of the Pt supported on silicalite-1 nanosheet."
[10] "It was also found that a small amount of methane and ethane derived from catalytic cracking was observed."
[11] "In strong contrast to this, the Pt supported catalyst exhibited the selectivity of propylene about 95.2%, although the low Pt loading of 0.5 wt.% was used."
[12] "In addition, the electronic properties of Pt over different supports were also changed. The negative charge of Pt over the Pt4/Q3-MFI model is relatively larger than that of the Pt4/Q4-MFI model, suggesting that the silanol groups can promote the electron transfer from the supports to Pt cluster."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production, with several commercial licensing processes available, including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus and the Oleflex process from Honeywell UOP.

2. Zeolites, especially silicalite-1, offer high surface area and thermal/hydrothermal stability, making them suitable for use as catalyst supports.

3. Metal aggregation after thermal treatment can lead to low catalytic selectivity in zeolite-supported catalysts. Introducing a mesoporous system into the zeolite network can improve metal dispersion through increased defect sites.

4. The catalytic performance depends on the interaction between metal and support, as well as acidity.

5. N2 sorption measurements were used to assess the textural properties of the catalysts.

6. Silicalite-1 nanosheets have a higher total pore volume compared to conventional silicalite-1, indicating the presence of meso- and macroporosity.

7. Hierarchical structures in silicalite-1 nanosheets allow for a stronger interaction between metal and support, reducing the risk of metal aggregation.

8. The addition of Pt on silicalite-1 nanosheets increases the surface silanol density, enhancing the catalyst's performance.

9. Defect sites in zeolite nanosheets, such as silanol surfaces, can improve metal-support interaction.

10. Low Pt loading on silicalite-1 nanosheets can still achieve high propylene selectivity.

11. Silanol surfaces or defects in zeolite nanosheets can promote electron transfer from the support to the Pt cluster, weakening propylene adsorption and enhancing selectivity.

12. The hierarchical structure of the catalyst allows for better dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and shortens the diffusion path length for propylene production, suppressing further reactions like oligomerization.
