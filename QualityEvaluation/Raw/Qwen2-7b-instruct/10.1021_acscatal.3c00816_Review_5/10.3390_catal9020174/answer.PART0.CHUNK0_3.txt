2.1. Structures and Properties of Catalysts: "In addition, there were no detectable PtO2 characteristics in XRD patterns of all supports indicating the well dispersion of Pt or the relatively low amount of Pt loading (Figure 1A)."
2.2. Dehydrogenation of Propane over Pt Nanoparticles Supported on Different Supports: "Interestingly, the high selectivity of propylene above 95% was observed, indicating that the side reactions were diminished on this catalyst."
2.3. Effects of WHSV and Pt Loading on the Propylene Selectivity: "It was also found that the highly selective production of propylene (>95%) was observed when the WHSV was greater than 2.8 h1, indicating that the short contact time suppressed side reactions."

1. Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a large number of defect sites and external surfaces, which improve the interaction with metals. The synthesis methods typically involve the use of different structure directing agents (SDAs) for hierarchical and conventional zeolites. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by preventing metal aggregation, suppressing side reactions, and enhancing the dispersion of metal species.

2. The hierarchical zeolite catalyst demonstrated a high propylene selectivity above 95%, indicating that the side reactions were minimized on this catalyst.

3. By increasing the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), the highly selective production of propylene (>95%) was observed, which suggests that the short contact time effectively suppressed side reactions during the PDH process.

1. 高级孔结构沸石通过提供大量缺陷位点和外表面，结合微孔与介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应中的可接近性。合成方法通常涉及使用不同结构导向剂（SDAs）来制备高级和常规沸石。与传统沸石相比，这些材料通过防止金属聚集、抑制副反应以及提高金属物种的分散性来改善PDH反应性能。

2. 这种高级沸石催化剂展示了超过95%的高丙烯选择性，表明该催化剂上侧反应被最大程度地减小。

3. 通过增加重量小时空速（WHSV），观察到高选择性生产丙烯（>95%），这表明短接触时间有效抑制了PDH过程中的副反应。
