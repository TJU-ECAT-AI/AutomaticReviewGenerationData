[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]."
[4] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40]."
[5] "However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]."
[6] "In addition, its catalytic performance will be discussed in terms of the roles of metal-support interaction and acidity."
[7] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."
[8] "The silicalite-1 nanosheets showed a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."
[9] "Interestingly, in the case of Pt supported on silicalite-1 nanosheets, another reduction peak at higher temperature of 500 C was observed. It is therefore reasonable to imply that there are some Pt species having a strong interaction with support due to the hierarchical structure, resulting in the higher resistance towards the reduction of Pt species."
[10] "The silanol surfaces or defect sites of hierarchical zeolite nanosheets can be greatly enhanced compared to the conventional silicalite-1, eventually resulting in enhancing the interaction of metal and support, thus preventing the aggregation of Pt clusters (Scheme 1)."
[11] "In addition, the Pt metal nanoparticles supported on zeolite nanosheets have remained the well-dispersion with the similar size of 2.1  0.7 nm."
[12] "These observations may have the benefit of an increase in metal dispersion and it is complementary to the development of the well-dispersed metallic nanoparticles on solid supports in PDH reaction [52]."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a larger number of defect sites and increasing the dispersion of metal species. This is achieved through the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network, which improves the dispersion of metal species. The hierarchical structures of these materials allow for improved catalytic efficiency in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites, particularly in processes involving bulky molecules like hydroisomerization, aromatization, and hydrodesulfurization. The presence of meso- and macroporosity increases the total pore volume, which facilitates better access to the active sites on the catalyst. Additionally, the hierarchical structure prevents metal aggregation, maintaining a high level of dispersion and reducing the risk of side reactions such as oligomerization. The silanol surfaces or defect sites on the hierarchical zeolite nanosheets enhance the interaction between metal and support, preventing the aggregation of Pt clusters. This results in a catalyst that is highly selective for propylene production from propane dehydrogenation, with improved performance and stability compared to conventional zeolites. The enhanced dispersion of metal nanoparticles on the zeolite nanosheets also contributes to better metal dispersion and complements the development of well-dispersed metallic nanoparticles in PDH reactions.

层级沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统，提供更多的缺陷位点并增加金属物种的分散性，从而结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应中的可接近性。这使得这些材料能够以比传统沸石更高的催化效率进行PDH反应，特别是在涉及大型分子如氢异构化、芳香化和脱硫化的过程。介孔和大孔的存在增加了总孔体积，从而更好地促进了活性位点对催化剂的访问。此外，层级结构防止了金属聚集，维持了高度分散性，并减少了如寡聚化等副反应的风险。层级沸石纳米片上的硅醇表面或缺陷位点增强了金属与支持物之间的相互作用，防止了铂簇的聚集。这导致了一种在丙烷脱氢为丙烯过程中具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂，与常规沸石相比性能和稳定性更好。金属纳米颗粒在沸石纳米片上的增强分散也有助于更好的金属分散，并补充了PDH反应中具有良好分散性的金属纳米颗粒的发展。
