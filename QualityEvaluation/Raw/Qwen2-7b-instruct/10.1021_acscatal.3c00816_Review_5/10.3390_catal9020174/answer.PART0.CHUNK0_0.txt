[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is considered the most economical and efficient method for propylene production. It involves converting propane into propylene through a chemical reaction, which has been developed through various licensed processes, including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP).

2. Propane dehydrogenation is among the key technologies for producing propylene from alternative substrates, alongside methanol-to-olefin (MTO), ethylene and butylene metathesis, and other processes. Its development is driven by the growing demand for propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources.

3. The challenge in propane dehydrogenation lies in developing catalysts that offer high selectivity and stability under severe industrial operating conditions.

4. Most propylene is typically produced as a byproduct during steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons.

5. The increased selectivity to cracked products over the alumina support is due to its high concentration of acidic sites, which promotes cracking reactions.

6. Hierarchical zeolite nanosheets enhance the interaction between metal and support by providing more defect sites and silanol surfaces. This prevents the aggregation of Pt clusters, improving the catalyst's performance.

1. 烷基化是生产丙烯最经济、最短途径的工艺，已经商业化，并通过多个许可过程开发，如CB&I Lummus的Catofin过程和Universal Oil Products（或Honeywell UOP）的Oleflex过程。

2. 烷基化是用于从替代原料生产丙烯的关键技术之一，与其他技术如甲醇到烯烃（MTO），乙烯和丁烯的异构化等并驾齐驱。其发展是由对丙烯需求的增长以及石油资源的枯竭所推动的。

3. 在烷基化过程中，提高催化剂的高选择性和稳定性以适应工业生产条件下的严重操作条件是一个巨大的挑战。

4. 大部分丙烯是从蒸汽裂解和液体催化裂解的碳氢化合物中作为副产品获得的。

5. 增加裂化产品的选择性与铝氧化物支持体含有大量酸性位点有关，这些酸性位点在NH3-TPD结果中显示出来，从而促进了裂化反应。

6. 层状沸石纳米片通过提供更多的缺陷位点和硅醇表面，增强了金属和支撑物之间的相互作用，防止了铂簇的聚集，从而提高了催化剂的性能。
