[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "The reason for this increase in cracked product selectivity relates to the fact that the Al2O3 support composes of the high amount of acid sites as shown in NH3-TPD results (see Figure S3), resulting in the promotion of cracking reaction."
[3] "It was also found that a small amount of methane and ethane derived from catalytic cracking was observed."
[4] "This is consistent with the view that the modified hierarchical structure enhances the PDH performances by changing the structure of Pt. The high dispersion degree of small Pt particles is responsible for the enhancement of the propane dehydrogenation performances."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is considered the most economical and efficient method for propylene production, and it is commercially available through various licensing processes like the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus and the Oleflex process from Honeywell UOP.

2. The increased selectivity of cracked products over the conventional silicalite-1 is attributed to the high concentration of acid sites on the alumina support, which promotes the cracking reaction.

3. Alongside propylene, a minor amount of methane and ethane was also produced through catalytic cracking during the process.

4. The enhanced performance of propane dehydrogenation is associated with the modification of hierarchical structure, which changes the structure of Pt and results in a high dispersion of small Pt particles, thereby improving the performance of the catalyst.

1. 烷基化脱氢被认为是丙烯生产最经济、最短的途径，并且已经商业化，通过各种授权流程实现，如CB&I Lummus的Catofin过程和Honeywell UOP的Oleflex过程。

2. 常规硅铝土催化剂中裂解产物选择性增加的原因在于其氧化铝支持体具有高酸性位点，这促进了裂解反应。

3. 在过程中，除丙烯外，还观察到了少量的甲烷和乙烷通过催化裂解产生。

4. 丙烷脱氢性能的提升与层级结构的修改有关，这种修改改变了铂的结构，并导致小铂颗粒的高度分散，从而提高了催化剂的性能。
