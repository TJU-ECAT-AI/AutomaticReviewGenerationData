1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance the accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary categories of these materials encompass pillared zeolites, interlayered zeolites, and templated zeolites. Synthesis methods typically employ sol-gel processes, hydrothermal treatments, and ion-exchange techniques. Compared to conventional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites demonstrate enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions.
