Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The primary types of these materials are MCM-41, SBA-15, and MCM-22. Synthesis methods include sol-gel processes, template-directed assembly, and hydrothermal treatments. These materials enhance PDH reaction performance by increasing surface area and offering more active sites for catalysis.
