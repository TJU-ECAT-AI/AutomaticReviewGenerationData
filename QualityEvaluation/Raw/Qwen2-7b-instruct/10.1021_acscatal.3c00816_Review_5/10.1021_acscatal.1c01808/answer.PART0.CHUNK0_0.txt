1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. The key types of these materials are ZSM-5, MFI, and MEL. Synthesis is usually achieved through hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-directed synthesis. Compared to conventional zeolites, these materials enhance the PDH reaction performance thanks to increased surface area and controlled pore size distribution.
