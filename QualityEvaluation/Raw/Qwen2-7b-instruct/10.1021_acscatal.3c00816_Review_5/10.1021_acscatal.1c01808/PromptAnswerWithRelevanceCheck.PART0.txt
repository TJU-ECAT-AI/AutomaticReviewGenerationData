Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions."
[2] "The main types of hierarchical zeolites include ZSM-5, MFI, and MEL."
[3] "Synthesis methods typically involve hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-directed synthesis."
[4] "These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites due to enhanced surface area and controlled pore size distribution."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores and mesopores/macropores to boost the accessibility for PDH reactions. The key types of these materials are ZSM-5, MFI, and MEL. Synthesis is usually achieved through hydrothermal treatment, sol-gel processes, and template-directed synthesis. Compared to conventional zeolites, these materials enhance the PDH reaction performance thanks to increased surface area and controlled pore size distribution.
