1. Hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores and mesopores/macropores. This combination improves the diffusion of reactants and products, leading to better performance.
2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites used in PDH reactions are synthesized through a modified Stöber process, allowing for the controlled creation of both micropores and mesopores/macropores within the zeolite structure.
3. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show improved performance in PDH reactions due to their enhanced pore accessibility.

1. 级联结构沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔，提高了丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的可访问性。这种组合改善了反应物和产物的扩散，从而提高了性能。
2. 在PDH反应中使用的主要类型为级联结构沸石，它们是通过修改Stöber过程合成的，允许在沸石结构内控制创建微孔和介孔/大孔。
3. 相比传统沸石，级联结构沸石在PDH反应中的表现更优，这是由于其增强的孔隙可访问性。
