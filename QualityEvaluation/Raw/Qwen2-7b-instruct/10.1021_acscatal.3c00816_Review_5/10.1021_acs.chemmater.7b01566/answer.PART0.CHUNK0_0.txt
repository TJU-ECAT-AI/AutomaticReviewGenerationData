1. Hierarchical Ga-MFI catalysts combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, which involves creating a structure with both small and larger pores for better reagent access.
2. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are those with ordered pore structures and those with mixed pore sizes, allowing for tailored pore networks.
3. Synthesis methods for these materials often use template-directed assembly or sacrificial template removal techniques to create the desired pore architecture.
4. Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites show improved activity, selectivity, and stability due to their enhanced pore accessibility.

1. 级联Ga-MFI催化剂通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的可接近性，这意味着在结构中创建具有不同大小的孔以改善试剂的进入。
2. 级联沸石的主要类型包括具有有序孔结构的沸石和具有混合孔尺寸的沸石，允许定制孔网络。
3. 这些材料的合成方法通常使用模板导向组装或牺牲模板去除技术来创建所需的孔结构。
4. 相比传统的沸石，级联沸石由于其增强的孔可接近性，在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出改进。
