Answer: The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complexity allows for a more comprehensive insight into the interactions and dynamics within the catalytic process, revealing how surface and gas-phase reactions synergistically influence the efficiency and selectivity of the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons. These synergistic effects have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they guide the development of strategies to enhance the activity and stability of boron nitride catalysts, leading to improved yield and product quality in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
