[1] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[2] "At a 6.5% conversion level of propane, it offers a surprising propylene selectivity as high as 97.4%."
[3] "As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."
[4] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[5] "The cleavage of CH bonds readily happens after oxygen activation in the BNOH catalytic system for the ODH of propane."
[6] "Hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generates the active sites, which triggers propane dehydrogenation."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, such as edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH), contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This catalyst system enables both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, showcasing the synergy between these processes. The selective activation of the CH bond in propane by the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride is a key aspect of this mechanism. This selective activation is achieved through hydrogen abstraction, which simultaneously prevents the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. The stability of the BNOH catalyst, evidenced by its ability to maintain steady conversion and product selectivity over a 300-hour operation at 530°C, highlights the robustness of this system under industrial conditions. Furthermore, the ease with which CH bonds are cleaved after oxygen activation in the BNOH catalytic system underscores the efficiency of the ODH process facilitated by this catalyst. This multidimensional mechanism not only enhances the selectivity towards propylene but also minimizes unwanted CO2 formation, making it a promising alternative for the industrial production of propylene via the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

多维性质的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应机制，特别是在硼基催化剂如边羟基化硼氮化物（BNOH）上的表现，对整体反应网络的理解做出了重大贡献。这种催化系统能够实现表面和气相自由基反应的协同作用。边羟基化在硼氮化物中的CH键选择性激活是这一机制的关键部分。通过氢原子抽取，这一过程能够选择性地激活丙烷的CH键，同时阻止丙烯过氧化为二氧化碳。BNOH催化剂的稳定性，体现在其在530°C下连续运行300小时时，转化率和产品选择性保持稳定，这表明该系统在工业条件下具有强大的耐久性。此外，氧气激活后迅速断裂CH键的能力突显了BNOH催化系统促进ODHP过程的效率。这一多维机制不仅提高了丙烯的选择性，而且最大限度地减少了不希望产生的二氧化碳形成，使其成为通过氧化脱氢法生产丙烯的有前景的替代方案。
