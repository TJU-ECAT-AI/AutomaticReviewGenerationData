The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by showing how the active sites generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen trigger propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond while simultaneously shutting off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. This synergy allows for high selectivity in propylene production and minimal CO2 formation. The stability tests, lasting 300 hours with no significant variations in conversion and product selectivity, highlight the robustness of the BNOH catalyst under industrial conditions. The ability to achieve a high propylene selectivity even at lower propane conversion levels indicates the catalyst's versatility and efficiency. The dynamic generation of active sites ensures a controlled and selective reaction pathway, which is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and designing more efficient systems for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
