The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron nitride-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This includes the dynamic generation of active sites on the catalyst surface through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, which triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond. Simultaneously, this process suppresses the overoxidation of propylene to CO2, highlighting the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions on catalyst performance. These findings suggest that the precise control of surface chemistry and the interaction dynamics between reactants and catalysts play crucial roles in achieving high selectivity and stability in the ODHP process. This knowledge can be applied to catalyst design optimization, aiming to enhance the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the ODHP reaction by tailoring the catalyst's active sites and reaction pathways.
