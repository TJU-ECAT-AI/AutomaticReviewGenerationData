The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron nitride-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This includes the dynamic generation of active sites on the catalyst surface through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, which triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond. Simultaneously, this process suppresses the overoxidation of propylene to CO2, highlighting the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions on catalyst performance. These findings suggest that the precise control of surface chemistry and the interaction dynamics between reactants and catalysts play crucial roles in achieving high selectivity and stability in the ODHP process. This knowledge can be applied to catalyst design optimization, aiming to enhance the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the ODHP reaction by tailoring the catalyst's active sites and reaction pathways.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism highlights the dynamic interplay between surface reactions, facilitated by the BOH groups, and gas-phase reactions, which are controlled by the selective activation of the CH bond in propane. The synergistic effects of these processes enhance the catalyst's performance by promoting efficient propane conversion while minimizing unwanted side reactions, such as the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. The high selectivity for propylene, combined with low CO2 formation, suggests that the catalyst optimally balances the reaction pathways, leading to improved efficiency and environmental sustainability. This discovery not only advances the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanisms but also paves the way for the development of more effective and sustainable catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

In summary, the B-based catalysts, with their unique ability to selectively activate the CH bond and suppress overoxidation, demonstrate a sophisticated mechanism that optimizes the ODHP reaction. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions results in enhanced product selectivity and reduced CO2 emissions, making them highly promising for both research and industrial-scale applications.

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, such as edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH), contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This catalyst system enables both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, showcasing the synergy between these processes. The selective activation of the CH bond in propane by the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride is a key aspect of this mechanism. This selective activation is achieved through hydrogen abstraction, which simultaneously prevents the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. The stability of the BNOH catalyst, evidenced by its ability to maintain steady conversion and product selectivity over a 300-hour operation at 530°C, highlights the robustness of this system under industrial conditions. Furthermore, the ease with which CH bonds are cleaved after oxygen activation in the BNOH catalytic system underscores the efficiency of the ODH process facilitated by this catalyst. This multidimensional mechanism not only enhances the selectivity towards propylene but also minimizes unwanted CO2 formation, making it a promising alternative for the industrial production of propylene via the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
