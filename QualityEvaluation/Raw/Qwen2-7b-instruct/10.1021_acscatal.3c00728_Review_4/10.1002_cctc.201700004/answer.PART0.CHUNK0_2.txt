[1] "Recent, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[2] "Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed."
[3] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[4] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[5] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C."
[6] "The formation of CO2 (0.5%) was considerably lower than for the traditional ODH processes (1060% CO2), demonstrating the excellent performance of the current BNOH catalyst in the selective activation of the CH bond in propane."
[7] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride."
[8] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation."
[9] "The characteristic band of hydroxyl stretching vibration was clearly observed at approximately 3400cm1."
[10] "Upon exposure to C3H8 atmosphere at 530C, the band position of the hydroxyl stretches remained unchanged, and no propane conversion was detected."
[11] "With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C3H8/He), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened."
[12] "The intensities of hydroxyl vibrational stretches were fully recovered upon steam activation."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, including both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these mechanisms allows for efficient and selective activation of the CH bond in propane, leading to the formation of propylene with minimal CO2 production. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the edges of boron nitride facilitates the selective breaking of the CH bond without promoting the overoxidation of propylene to CO2, enhancing the selectivity and stability of the BNOH catalyst. This understanding is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and designing new catalyst systems that can efficiently convert propane to propylene with high selectivity and reduced environmental impact.

多维性质的ODHP反应机制，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，对于理解整体反应网络至关重要。这些机制之间的协同作用使得硼基催化剂能够高效且选择性地活化丙烷中的CH键，从而形成丙烯并减少二氧化碳的生成。边缘上具有羟基的硼氮化物的存在促进了选择性断开CH键的操作，而不会促进丙烯过氧化为二氧化碳，从而提高了BNOH催化剂的选择性和稳定性。这种理解对于优化催化剂性能和设计新的催化剂系统以高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯并减少环境影响至关重要。
