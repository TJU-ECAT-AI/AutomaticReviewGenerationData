[1] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[2] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C. The conversion of propane approached 20.6%, which is equivalent to a reaction rate of 7.74g gcat1h1; the product slate consisted of propylene, ethylene, methane, CO, and CO2."
[3] "Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins (ethylene+propylene, C23=) was up to 90.9%, which was much higher than the selectivities obtained over the well-developed metal or metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level."
[4] "As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."
[5] "This novel and metal-free catalyst system not only opens up a new research direction in the selective activation of the CH bond of alkanes, but also serves as a highly potential catalyst for the industrial ODH process."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism highlights the dynamic interplay between surface reactions, facilitated by the BOH groups, and gas-phase reactions, which are controlled by the selective activation of the CH bond in propane. The synergistic effects of these processes enhance the catalyst's performance by promoting efficient propane conversion while minimizing unwanted side reactions, such as the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. The high selectivity for propylene, combined with low CO2 formation, suggests that the catalyst optimally balances the reaction pathways, leading to improved efficiency and environmental sustainability. This discovery not only advances the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanisms but also paves the way for the development of more effective and sustainable catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

In summary, the B-based catalysts, with their unique ability to selectively activate the CH bond and suppress overoxidation, demonstrate a sophisticated mechanism that optimizes the ODHP reaction. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions results in enhanced product selectivity and reduced CO2 emissions, making them highly promising for both research and industrial-scale applications.

多维的ODHP反应机制，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，对于理解整体反应网络提供了重要的贡献。这种机制强调了表面反应与气体反应之间的动态相互作用，表面反应由边缘上的BOH基团促进，而气体反应则通过选择性激活丙烷中的CH键进行控制。这些过程的协同效应通过高效地促进丙烷转化同时最小化不希望的副反应（如丙烯氧化为CO2）来增强催化剂性能。高丙烯选择性和低CO2生成表明催化剂能够优化反应途径，从而提高效率并实现环境可持续性。这一发现不仅深化了催化机制的基本理解，也为开发更有效和可持续的催化剂提供了方向，尤其是在氧化脱氢化过程的应用领域。

简而言之，基于B的催化剂以其独特的能力，选择性地激活CH键并抑制过氧化，展示了复杂的机制，优化了ODHP反应。表面和气相反应之间的这种协同作用导致了产品选择性的提高和CO2排放的减少，使其成为研究和工业规模应用中极具前景的催化剂。
