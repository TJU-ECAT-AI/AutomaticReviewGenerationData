[1] "Despite the promising advances of particulate boron-based catalysts in ODHP reaction, the problems such as high pressure drop of the catalyst packing and poor mass transfer in the catalyst pellets may limit their large scale application."
[2] "Monolithic honeycomb ceramic catalyst with well-developed straight channels is capable to facilitate the active phase dispersion and efficient use of the catalyst, narrow the residence time differences and lower the pressure drop under high space velocity."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."
[4] "These results strongly indicate that the boron-based monolithic catalyst can be properly fabricated to warrant the high activity and high throughput with its high gas/surface ratio and straight channels."
[5] "The catalyst supports may have great impact on the product distribution of the resultant catalysts. Because the monolithic structure allows a uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the monolithic wall shorten the diffusion paths so that the overoxidation was restrained."
[6] "The promising performance of the catalyst was attributed to not only the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, but also the improved mass transfer brought by the honeycomb structure."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these different facets of the reaction pathway enhances the effectiveness of the catalyst in promoting desired conversions and selectivities. Specifically, the surface reactions lead to the activation of propane molecules, while the gas-phase reactions involve the propagation and termination of radical chains, which together govern the overall product distribution. 

The implications of their synergistic effects on catalyst performance and design optimization are profound. They necessitate a comprehensive approach to catalyst development, focusing not just on the intrinsic reactivity of the active site species (such as the tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species), but also on how these species are dispersed and attached to the support material. Moreover, the efficiency of mass transfer within the catalyst matrix plays a critical role in mitigating unwanted side reactions, such as overoxidation, and in ensuring that the active components are utilized optimally. The design of monolithic honeycomb ceramic catalysts, with their well-developed straight channels and high gas/surface ratios, facilitates this by enabling efficient dispersion of the active phases, reducing residence time differences among the catalyst particles, and minimizing pressure drops at high gas hourly space velocities. 

In summary, the multidimensional reaction mechanism of ODHP over boron-based catalysts underscores the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and the macroscopic properties of the catalyst, such as its structure and mass transfer characteristics, in optimizing catalyst performance. This holistic approach is essential for the development of industrially viable catalysts capable of achieving high activity, selectivity, and throughput in the ODHP process.

氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应机制在硼基催化剂上的多维特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解贡献巨大。这些不同方面反应路径的协同作用增强了催化剂促进所需转化和选择性的有效性。具体来说，表面反应导致丙烷分子的激活，而气相反应涉及自由基链的传播和终止，这共同决定了最终产物分布。

它们之间的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。这要求采取全面的方法来开发催化剂，不仅关注活性位点物种（如三配位硼氧醇和线性羟基硼物种）的内在反应性，还关注这些物种如何在支撑材料上分散和附着。此外，催化剂基质中的质量传输效率对于减少非期望副反应（如过氧化），并确保活性成分被充分利用至关重要。通过设计具有良好直通道和高气体/表面比的多孔陶瓷催化剂，可以实现这一目标，从而通过高效分散活性组分、减少颗粒间停留时间差异以及在高气体小时空间速度下最小化压力降，提高催化效率。

总之，ODHP过程中硼基催化剂的多维反应机制强调了考虑催化剂的表面化学和宏观特性（如其结构和质量传输特性）以优化催化剂性能的重要性。这种全面的方法对于开发能够在ODHP过程中实现高活性、选择性和通量的工业可行催化剂至关重要。
