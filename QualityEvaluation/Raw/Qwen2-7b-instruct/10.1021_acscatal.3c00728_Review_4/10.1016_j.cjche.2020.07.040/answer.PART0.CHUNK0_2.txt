[1] "The presence of B2O3 largely promoted the catalytic activity as compared to the SiO2@HC support."
[2] "The monolithic structure allows a uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the monolithic wall shorten the diffusion paths so that the overoxidation was restrained."
[3] "The honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst was designed and prepared by a two-step coating method. A high selectivity toward olefin (97.2%) and negligible production of CO2 (0.1%) under high space velocity gave a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6(g B2O3)1·h1 for ODHP."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This understanding implies that the synergistic effects between surface reactions and gas-phase reactions are crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization. The active sites on the catalyst surface, such as tricoordinated BO species, play a pivotal role in promoting the reaction. By optimizing the catalyst structure, such as through the use of a monolithic honeycomb ceramic design, the mass transfer is improved, which restrains overoxidation. The strategic coating method ensures efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, leading to enhanced performance. The synergy between the monolithic structure, the active B2O3 layer, and optimized diffusion paths enables high olefin selectivity and low CO2 production, resulting in a high propylene productivity. These findings underscore the importance of considering multiple aspects of the reaction mechanism and catalyst design to achieve optimal performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
