[1] "The presence of B2O3 largely promoted the catalytic activity as compared to the SiO2@HC support."
[2] "The monolithic structure allows a uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the monolithic wall shorten the diffusion paths so that the overoxidation was restrained."
[3] "The honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst was designed and prepared by a two-step coating method. A high selectivity toward olefin (97.2%) and negligible production of CO2 (0.1%) under high space velocity gave a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6(g B2O3)1·h1 for ODHP."
[4] "The promising performance of the catalyst was attributed to not only the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, but also the improved mass transfer brought by the honeycomb structure."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. These reactions work synergistically to enhance the overall efficiency of the process. The surface reactions occur on the active sites of the catalyst, facilitating the conversion of propane molecules into olefins and other products. Simultaneously, gas-phase reactions play a crucial role in the formation of these products and the elimination of unwanted byproducts, such as carbon dioxide. The synergy between these surface and gas-phase reactions optimizes the selectivity towards desired products like propylene, while minimizing the formation of undesirable byproducts. This understanding provides insights into the catalyst performance and guides the design optimization by focusing on improving the distribution of active sites, enhancing the stability of the catalyst, and promoting efficient mass transfer within the reactor. The optimized catalyst design aims to maximize the propylene productivity and selectivity, leading to a more efficient and environmentally friendly process for the production of propylene from propane.
