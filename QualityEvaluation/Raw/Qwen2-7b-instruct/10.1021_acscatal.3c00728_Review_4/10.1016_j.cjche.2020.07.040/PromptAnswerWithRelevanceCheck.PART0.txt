The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions involve complex interactions between surface-bound intermediates and gas-phase species, which are influenced by the catalyst's structure, composition, and operational conditions. The synergistic effects of these reactions are critical for catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the active boron species on the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst enable efficient dispersion and firm attachment on the modified SiO2@HC support, while the honeycomb structure enhances mass transfer. This combination leads to high olefin selectivity, low CO2 production, and high propylene productivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the B-based catalysts for ODHP under high space velocity conditions.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions involve the interplay between surface chemistry, where boron species interact with the reactants, and gas-phase reactions, which include the formation and decomposition of radical species. The synergistic effects of these reactions enhance the catalyst's performance by promoting the desired chemical transformations while suppressing unwanted side reactions. The design of such catalysts often focuses on optimizing the active site density, stability, and accessibility, along with improving the mass transfer within the catalyst matrix. This synergy leads to enhanced selectivity and productivity, as demonstrated by the high propylene selectivity and negligible CO2 production achieved with the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst under high space velocity conditions. The catalyst's ability to maintain high olefin selectivity and low CO2 production at high space velocities suggests that the design strategy employed here is effective in balancing the competing reactions to favor the formation of propylene.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This understanding implies that the synergistic effects between surface reactions and gas-phase reactions are crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization. The active sites on the catalyst surface, such as tricoordinated BO species, play a pivotal role in promoting the reaction. By optimizing the catalyst structure, such as through the use of a monolithic honeycomb ceramic design, the mass transfer is improved, which restrains overoxidation. The strategic coating method ensures efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, leading to enhanced performance. The synergy between the monolithic structure, the active B2O3 layer, and optimized diffusion paths enables high olefin selectivity and low CO2 production, resulting in a high propylene productivity. These findings underscore the importance of considering multiple aspects of the reaction mechanism and catalyst design to achieve optimal performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. These reactions work synergistically to enhance the overall efficiency of the process. The surface reactions occur on the active sites of the catalyst, facilitating the conversion of propane molecules into olefins and other products. Simultaneously, gas-phase reactions play a crucial role in the formation of these products and the elimination of unwanted byproducts, such as carbon dioxide. The synergy between these surface and gas-phase reactions optimizes the selectivity towards desired products like propylene, while minimizing the formation of undesirable byproducts. This understanding provides insights into the catalyst performance and guides the design optimization by focusing on improving the distribution of active sites, enhancing the stability of the catalyst, and promoting efficient mass transfer within the reactor. The optimized catalyst design aims to maximize the propylene productivity and selectivity, leading to a more efficient and environmentally friendly process for the production of propylene from propane.

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these different facets of the reaction pathway enhances the effectiveness of the catalyst in promoting desired conversions and selectivities. Specifically, the surface reactions lead to the activation of propane molecules, while the gas-phase reactions involve the propagation and termination of radical chains, which together govern the overall product distribution. 

The implications of their synergistic effects on catalyst performance and design optimization are profound. They necessitate a comprehensive approach to catalyst development, focusing not just on the intrinsic reactivity of the active site species (such as the tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species), but also on how these species are dispersed and attached to the support material. Moreover, the efficiency of mass transfer within the catalyst matrix plays a critical role in mitigating unwanted side reactions, such as overoxidation, and in ensuring that the active components are utilized optimally. The design of monolithic honeycomb ceramic catalysts, with their well-developed straight channels and high gas/surface ratios, facilitates this by enabling efficient dispersion of the active phases, reducing residence time differences among the catalyst particles, and minimizing pressure drops at high gas hourly space velocities. 

In summary, the multidimensional reaction mechanism of ODHP over boron-based catalysts underscores the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and the macroscopic properties of the catalyst, such as its structure and mass transfer characteristics, in optimizing catalyst performance. This holistic approach is essential for the development of industrially viable catalysts capable of achieving high activity, selectivity, and throughput in the ODHP process.
