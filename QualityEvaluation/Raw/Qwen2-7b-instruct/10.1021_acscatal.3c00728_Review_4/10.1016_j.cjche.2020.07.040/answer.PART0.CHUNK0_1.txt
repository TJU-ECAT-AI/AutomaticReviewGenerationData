The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions involve the interplay between surface chemistry, where boron species interact with the reactants, and gas-phase reactions, which include the formation and decomposition of radical species. The synergistic effects of these reactions enhance the catalyst's performance by promoting the desired chemical transformations while suppressing unwanted side reactions. The design of such catalysts often focuses on optimizing the active site density, stability, and accessibility, along with improving the mass transfer within the catalyst matrix. This synergy leads to enhanced selectivity and productivity, as demonstrated by the high propylene selectivity and negligible CO2 production achieved with the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst under high space velocity conditions. The catalyst's ability to maintain high olefin selectivity and low CO2 production at high space velocities suggests that the design strategy employed here is effective in balancing the competing reactions to favor the formation of propylene.

多维度的ODHP反应机制，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解具有重要意义。这些反应涉及表面化学和气体相反应之间的相互作用，其中硼物种与反应物相互作用，以及形成和分解自由基物种的气体相反应。这些反应的协同效应通过促进所需化学转化并抑制不希望的副反应来增强催化剂的性能。催化剂设计通常侧重于优化活性位点密度、稳定性和可接近性，同时改善催化剂矩阵内的质量传输。这种协同作用导致了提高选择性和生产力的结果，如使用B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂在高空速条件下实现高丙烯选择性和低CO2排放所展示的那样。催化剂能够保持高烯烃选择性和低CO2排放的能力表明，这里采用的设计策略有效地平衡了竞争反应，以有利于丙烯的形成。
