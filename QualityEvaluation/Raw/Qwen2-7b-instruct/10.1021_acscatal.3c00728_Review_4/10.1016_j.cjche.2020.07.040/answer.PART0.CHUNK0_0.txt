[1] "The high selectivity toward olefin (97.2%) and negligible production of CO2 (0.1%) under high space velocity gave a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6(g B2O3)1·h1 for ODHP."
[2] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."
[4] "The advantages of monolithic structure were also discussed on the basis of catalytic performance under high GHSV."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions involve complex interactions between surface-bound intermediates and gas-phase species, which are influenced by the catalyst's structure, composition, and operational conditions. The synergistic effects of these reactions are critical for catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the active boron species on the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst enable efficient dispersion and firm attachment on the modified SiO2@HC support, while the honeycomb structure enhances mass transfer. This combination leads to high olefin selectivity, low CO2 production, and high propylene productivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the B-based catalysts for ODHP under high space velocity conditions.

ODHP反应机制的多维度特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对于理解整个反应网络具有重要意义。这些反应涉及表面结合中间体与气相物种之间的复杂相互作用，受催化剂结构、组成和操作条件的影响。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化至关重要。具体而言，B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂上的活性硼物种能够高效分散并牢固附着在修改后的SiO2@HC支持上，而蜂窝结构则增强质量传输。这种组合导致高烯烃选择性、低CO2生成以及高丙烯产率，证明了基于B的催化剂在高空速条件下对ODHP的有效性。
