The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions over boron-based catalysts, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding is crucial as it reveals the intricate interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which significantly impacts catalyst performance. The synergistic effects of these reactions imply that optimizing one aspect could enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts, leading to improved performance in the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons or other valuable products.
