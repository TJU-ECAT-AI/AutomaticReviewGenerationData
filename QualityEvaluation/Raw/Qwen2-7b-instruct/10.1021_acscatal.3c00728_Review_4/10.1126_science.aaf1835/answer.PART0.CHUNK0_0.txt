The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these processes allows for the precise control of CC coupling, which is essential for the selective formation of light olefins from syngas. This is achieved by manipulating the reaction pathways to block the surface polymerization of CHx, thus avoiding the limitations imposed by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The catalyst design optimizes CO activation and CC coupling, allowing for high conversions and selectivities in the production of light olefins.

The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage the competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The ability to tune the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component suggests that catalyst design can be tailored to meet specific product requirements. Moreover, the use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios.

The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, highlight its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, showcasing its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component further underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

ODHP反应机制在基于B的催化剂上的多维度特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解做出了重大贡献。这些过程之间的协同作用允许精确控制CC耦合，这是从合成气生产轻质烯烃的关键。通过阻止表面CHx的聚合路径，从而避免了Fischer-Tropsch合成中由Anderson-Schulz-Flory（ASF）模型施加的限制，实现了这一点。催化剂设计优化了CO激活和CC耦合，使得轻质烯烃的高转化率和选择性成为可能。

这些协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。通过结合表面和气相反应，催化剂系统可以有效地管理与合成气到轻质烯烃转换相关的竞争途径。这导致了所需产品的更高选择性，减少了不希望有的副产品如甲烷的形成，并提高了随时间的稳定性。通过调整酸性沸石组件的酸性来调节辛烯/正构烷烃比表明，催化剂设计可以根据特定的产品需求进行定制。此外，利用部分还原的氧化物表面进行CO激活，结合沸石的受控酸性孔隙进行CC耦合，使同时调整CO转化率和烯烃选择性的灵活性得以实现。这为合成气到烯烃技术的发展开辟了新途径，有可能高效地利用煤炭和生物质来源的合成气，即使其H2/CO比变化。

复合催化剂的高选择性和稳定性，在长达110小时的测试中得到证明，突显了其工业应用潜力。结果表明，催化剂可以在持续操作下保持高C2C4选择性（94%）和低甲烷含量（2%），展示了其稳健性和效率。此外，通过MSAPO组件直接将酮烯转化为轻质烯烃的过程进一步强调了催化剂多功能性和组件间交互的重要性，以实现最佳反应结果。
