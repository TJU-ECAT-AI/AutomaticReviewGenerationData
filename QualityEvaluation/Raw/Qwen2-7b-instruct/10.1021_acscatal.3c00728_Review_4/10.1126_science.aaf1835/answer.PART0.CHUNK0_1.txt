[1] "The conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid fuels or chemicals often proceeds through the production of CO and H2. This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts."
[2] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
[3] "Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong)."
[4] "A zinc-chromium oxide creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite."
[5] "This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties."
[6] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
[7] "No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours."
[8] "Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."
[9] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1)."
[10] "Figure 1A shows that C2=C4= selectivity reached 74% at CO conversion of 16% over a catalyst with a mass ratio of ZnCrOx/MSAPO = 1.4, under reaction conditions of H2/CO = 1.5, pressure 2.5 MPa, and space velocity 4800 ml/h·gcat."
[11] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
[12] "The reactivity of this composite catalyst showed good reproducibility, with CO conversion and selectivity fluctuating within 4 and 5%, respectively, among 11 tests (fig. S3)."
[13] "Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C)."
[14] "Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15)."
[15] "We attribute the efficiency of the OX-ZEO process to the bifunctionality of the catalyst, with two types of active sites exhibiting complementary and compatible properties."
[16] "Activation of the CO bond has been reported previously for surfaces promoted with oxygen vacanciesfor example, Fe3O4 (16), CoOx/TiO2 (17), Cu/ZnO (0001) (18), and ZnGa2O4 (19)."
[17] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the ZnCr2O4 spinel (111) surface as a model reveal that it is reducible, resulting in a surface with a number of oxygen vacancies (figs. S5 and S6) (9)."
[18] "In situ near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) of ZnCrOx surface (Fig. 2B) revealed a new signal with a lower Zn3d binding energy upon exposure to H2 and CO, compared with the initial oxidized surface."
[19] "Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there may exist an optimum acidity with NH3 desorption temperature <350C for olefin formation."
[20] "The capability of the partially reduced oxide in activating CO but incapability of catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx makes it possible to manipulate CC coupling with confined acidic zeolite pores."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to the overall reaction network. This mechanism allows for the simultaneous manipulation of CO conversion and olefin selectivity, where the surface structure of the oxides controls CO conversion, and the properties of zeolites, particularly their pore structure and acidity, control olefin selectivity. The synergy between these two aspects enables the catalyst to achieve higher conversions and avoid deactivation, which is a significant improvement over conventional catalysts. The ability to tune CO conversion and olefin selectivity independently opens up new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially allowing for the utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.

The implications of this synergistic effect are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. It suggests that by carefully designing the catalyst composition and structure, it may be possible to enhance both the conversion efficiency and selectivity towards desired products, such as light olefins. This could lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for converting syngas into valuable chemical intermediates. Additionally, the stability of the catalyst, as demonstrated by the lack of obvious deactivation over 110 hours, indicates that the catalyst is robust and suitable for industrial-scale applications. The versatility in handling different feedstocks, including those derived from coal and biomass, broadens the applicability of the technology, making it a promising approach for sustainable chemical production.

ODHP反应机制在基于B的催化剂上的多维度特性，既包括表面反应也包括气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络做出了重大贡献。这种机制允许同时调整CO转化率和烯烃选择性，其中氧化物表面结构控制CO转化率，而沸石的性质，特别是其孔结构和酸度，控制烯烃选择性。这两种方面的协同作用使得催化剂能够实现更高的转化率并避免失活，这是常规催化剂无法达到的显著改进。通过独立调整CO转化率和烯烃选择性，为syngas-to-olefin技术的发展开辟了新途径，可能允许利用煤炭和生物质来源的syngas，尤其是氢气与一氧化碳比例较低的情况。

这种协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。它表明，通过精心设计催化剂的组成和结构，有可能提高目标产品的转化效率和选择性，例如轻质烯烃。这可能导致更高效、环境友好的过程，用于将syngas转化为有价值的化学中间体。此外，催化剂的稳定性，如在110小时内无明显失活的显示，表明催化剂耐用且适合工业规模应用。能够处理不同原料，包括煤炭和生物质衍生原料，扩大了该技术的应用范围，使其成为可持续化学生产有前景的方法。
