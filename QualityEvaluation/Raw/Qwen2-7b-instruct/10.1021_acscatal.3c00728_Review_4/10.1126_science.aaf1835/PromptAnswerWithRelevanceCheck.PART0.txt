[1] "The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation."
[2] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
[3] "This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B."
[4] "We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4)."
[5] "By forming ketene, the reaction pathway of surface polymerization of CHx is blocked, hence circumventing the ASF limits of FTS."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these processes allows for the precise control of CC coupling, which is essential for the selective formation of light olefins from syngas. This is achieved by manipulating the reaction pathways to block the surface polymerization of CHx, thus avoiding the limitations imposed by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The catalyst design optimizes CO activation and CC coupling, allowing for high conversions and selectivities in the production of light olefins.

The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage the competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The ability to tune the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component suggests that catalyst design can be tailored to meet specific product requirements. Moreover, the use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios.

The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, highlight its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, showcasing its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component further underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

ODHP反应机制在基于B的催化剂上的多维度特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解做出了重大贡献。这些过程之间的协同作用允许精确控制CC耦合，这是从合成气生产轻质烯烃的关键。通过阻止表面CHx的聚合路径，从而避免了Fischer-Tropsch合成中由Anderson-Schulz-Flory（ASF）模型施加的限制，实现了这一点。催化剂设计优化了CO激活和CC耦合，使得轻质烯烃的高转化率和选择性成为可能。

这些协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。通过结合表面和气相反应，催化剂系统可以有效地管理与合成气到轻质烯烃转换相关的竞争途径。这导致了所需产品的更高选择性，减少了不希望有的副产品如甲烷的形成，并提高了随时间的稳定性。通过调整酸性沸石组件的酸性来调节辛烯/正构烷烃比表明，催化剂设计可以根据特定的产品需求进行定制。此外，利用部分还原的氧化物表面进行CO激活，结合沸石的受控酸性孔隙进行CC耦合，使同时调整CO转化率和烯烃选择性的灵活性得以实现。这为合成气到烯烃技术的发展开辟了新途径，有可能高效地利用煤炭和生物质来源的合成气，即使其H2/CO比变化。

复合催化剂的高选择性和稳定性，在长达110小时的测试中得到证明，突显了其工业应用潜力。结果表明，催化剂可以在持续操作下保持高C2C4选择性（94%）和低甲烷含量（2%），展示了其稳健性和效率。此外，通过MSAPO组件直接将酮烯转化为轻质烯烃的过程进一步强调了催化剂多功能性和组件间交互的重要性，以实现最佳反应结果。

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to the overall reaction network. This mechanism allows for the simultaneous manipulation of CO conversion and olefin selectivity, where the surface structure of the oxides controls CO conversion, and the properties of zeolites, particularly their pore structure and acidity, control olefin selectivity. The synergy between these two aspects enables the catalyst to achieve higher conversions and avoid deactivation, which is a significant improvement over conventional catalysts. The ability to tune CO conversion and olefin selectivity independently opens up new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially allowing for the utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.

The implications of this synergistic effect are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. It suggests that by carefully designing the catalyst composition and structure, it may be possible to enhance both the conversion efficiency and selectivity towards desired products, such as light olefins. This could lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for converting syngas into valuable chemical intermediates. Additionally, the stability of the catalyst, as demonstrated by the lack of obvious deactivation over 110 hours, indicates that the catalyst is robust and suitable for industrial-scale applications. The versatility in handling different feedstocks, including those derived from coal and biomass, broadens the applicability of the technology, making it a promising approach for sustainable chemical production.

ODHP反应机制在基于B的催化剂上的多维度特性，既包括表面反应也包括气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络做出了重大贡献。这种机制允许同时调整CO转化率和烯烃选择性，其中氧化物表面结构控制CO转化率，而沸石的性质，特别是其孔结构和酸度，控制烯烃选择性。这两种方面的协同作用使得催化剂能够实现更高的转化率并避免失活，这是常规催化剂无法达到的显著改进。通过独立调整CO转化率和烯烃选择性，为syngas-to-olefin技术的发展开辟了新途径，可能允许利用煤炭和生物质来源的syngas，尤其是氢气与一氧化碳比例较低的情况。

这种协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。它表明，通过精心设计催化剂的组成和结构，有可能提高目标产品的转化效率和选择性，例如轻质烯烃。这可能导致更高效、环境友好的过程，用于将syngas转化为有价值的化学中间体。此外，催化剂的稳定性，如在110小时内无明显失活的显示，表明催化剂耐用且适合工业规模应用。能够处理不同原料，包括煤炭和生物质衍生原料，扩大了该技术的应用范围，使其成为可持续化学生产有前景的方法。

[8] "The capability of the partially reduced oxide in activating CO but incapability of catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx makes it possible to manipulate CC coupling with confined acidic zeolite pores. Thus, the CO conversion and selectivity can be tuned at the same timei.e., CO conversion is manipulated via the surface structure of the oxides and the ratio of oxides/zeolite, whereas the olefin selectivity is controlled by the properties of zeolites, particularly the pore structure and acidity."
