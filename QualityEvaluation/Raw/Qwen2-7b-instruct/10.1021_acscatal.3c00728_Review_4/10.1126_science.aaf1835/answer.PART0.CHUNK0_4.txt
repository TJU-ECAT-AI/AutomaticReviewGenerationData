[1] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1) (9)."
[2] "This result shows that reaction intermediates generated over the oxides must have transported in the gas phase toward the active sites of MSAPO, where they were converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons, rather than being hydrogenated to CH4 over the oxide or in gas phase."
[3] "We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4)."
[4] "By forming ketene, the reaction pathway of surface polymerization of CHx is blocked, hence circumventing the ASF limits of FTS."
[5] "Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there may exist an optimum acidity with NH3 desorption temperature <350C for olefin formation."

1. The composite catalyst utilized an oxide (ZnCrOx) with a spinel structure and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) with a CHA structure, showcasing a hierarchical pore texture.

2. The reaction intermediates generated over the oxide surfaces transported in the gas phase towards the active sites of MSAPO, where they were converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons, bypassing hydrogenation to CH4 over the oxide or in the gas phase.

3. The well-mixed composite catalyst yielded an exceptionally high C2=C4= selectivity of 80%, with an overall C2C4 selectivity of 94%, and only 2% CH4.

4. The formation of ketene blocks the surface polymerization of CHx, circumventing the limitations of the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS).

5. It is plausible that there exists an optimal acidity, characterized by an NH3 desorption temperature below 350°C, conducive to olefin formation.

1. 复合催化剂采用了具有立方结构的氧化物（ZnCrOx）和具有CHA结构的介孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO），展示了层次孔结构。

2. 生成于氧化物表面的反应中间体在气相中向MSAPO的活性位点传输，被转换为C2C4烃类，而非在氧化物表面或气相中氢化成CH4。

3. 在充分混合的复合催化剂中，C2=C4=的选择性达到80%，整体C2C4选择性达到94%，仅产生2%的CH4。

4. 通过形成酮烯，阻断了CHx的表面聚合途径，绕过了费歇尔-特罗普希合成（FTS）中的安德森-舒尔茨-弗洛里（ASF）模型限制。

5. 可能存在一个最佳酸度，其NH3脱附温度低于350°C，有利于烯烃的形成。
