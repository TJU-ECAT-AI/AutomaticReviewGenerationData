[1] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1) (9)."
[2] "Figure 1A shows that C2=C4= selectivity reached 74% at CO conversion of 16% over a catalyst with a mass ratio of ZnCrOx/MSAPO = 1.4, under reaction conditions of H2/CO = 1.5, pressure 2.5 MPa, and space velocity 4800 ml/h·gcat."
[3] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
[4] "The OX-ZEO process separated CO activation and CC coupling onto two different types of active sites with complementary properties. CO and H2 were activated over a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) surface, whereas CC coupling was controlled within the confined environment of zeolite pores with acidic sites."
[5] "Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15)."
[6] "The reactivity of this composite catalyst showed good reproducibility, with CO conversion and selectivity fluctuating within 4 and 5%, respectively, among 11 tests (fig. S3). Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C)."
[7] "In the absence of MSAPO (corresponding to Mode 1 of Fig. 2A), syngas was converted mainly to CH4 (selectivity 53%), and selectivity to C2C4 hydrocarbons was only 38% over ZnCrOx. Upon combination with MSAPO, which was packed below the oxide and separated by a layer of inert quartz wool (Mode 2), the products shifted and C2C4 selectivity increased to 69% containing 23% C2=C4=, whereas CH4 selectivity dropped to 26%."
[8] "The capability of the partially reduced oxide in activating CO but incapability of catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx makes it possible to manipulate CC coupling with confined acidic zeolite pores. Thus, the CO conversion and selectivity can be tuned at the same timei.e., CO conversion is manipulated via the surface structure of the oxides and the ratio of oxides/zeolite, whereas the olefin selectivity is controlled by the properties of zeolites, particularly the pore structure and acidity."

1. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. Their synergistic effects lead to improved catalyst performance and enable design optimization by allowing precise control over CO conversion and olefin selectivity.

2. The OX-ZEO process utilizes a composite catalyst with complementary active sites, one for CO activation (ZnCrOx) and another for CC coupling within the zeolite pores. This bifunctionality enables efficient selective conversion of syngas to light olefins.

3. The OX-ZEO process demonstrates high selectivity for light olefins, with a C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and C2=C4= selectivity up to 80%, significantly surpassing conventional catalysts' limitations. The process is also characterized by low methane and C5+ selectivities, indicating superior product purity.

4. The composite catalyst's performance is consistent across multiple tests, showcasing good reproducibility and stability. This stability ensures reliable operation and minimizes catalyst deactivation over time.

5. By integrating CO activation over ZnCrOx and CC coupling within zeolite pores, the OX-ZEO process achieves high selectivity for light olefins, even with a low H2/CO ratio. This versatility allows for the utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas, expanding the potential feedstock sources for olefin production.

6. The catalyst's bifunctionality stems from its dual active sites, one responsible for CO activation and the other for CC coupling. The partial reduction of the oxide surface facilitates CO activation, while the confined acidic environment of the zeolite pores enables efficient olefin formation.

7. The OX-ZEO process showcases the synergistic effects of combining CO activation and CC coupling, leading to high selectivity and stability. The use of a partially reduced oxide and zeolite catalysts allows for precise control over CO conversion and olefin selectivity, optimizing the overall reaction network.

8. The catalyst's ability to activate CO without catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx enables the manipulation of CC coupling within the zeolite pores. This feature allows for simultaneous tuning of CO conversion and olefin selectivity, enhancing the catalyst's performance and enabling efficient selective conversion of syngas to light olefins.
