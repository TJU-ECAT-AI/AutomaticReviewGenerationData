          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These processes enable precise control over CC coupling, crucial for selective production of light olefins from syngas. The catalyst's design optimizes CO activation and CC coupling, facilitating high conversions and selectivities in light olefin production. The synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for the efficient management of competing pathways, resulting in high olefin selectivity, reduced methane formation, and improved catalyst stability over time. The ability to tune the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component offers flexibility in product customization, and the catalyst's multifunctionality in managing both surface and gas-phase reactions highlights its potential for versatile syngas-to-olefin technologies.

          The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios.

          The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component further underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.
