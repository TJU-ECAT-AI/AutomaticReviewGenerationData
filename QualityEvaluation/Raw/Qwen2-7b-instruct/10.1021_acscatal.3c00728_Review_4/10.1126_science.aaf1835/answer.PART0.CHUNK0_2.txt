[1] "This result shows that reaction intermediates generated over the oxides must have transported in the gas phase toward the active sites of MSAPO, where they were converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons, rather than being hydrogenated to CH4 over the oxide or in gas phase."
[2] "The above results show that reaction via methanol may not be the dominating pathway in OX-ZEO, although it cannot be excluded completely, whereas ketene likely plays an important role."
[3] "These findings open up a new avenue for development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, which may allow utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to the overall reaction network by enabling the formation of a wide array of products. The synergy between these surface and gas-phase reactions enhances catalyst performance and facilitates the optimization of the reaction conditions. This understanding allows for the design of catalysts that can efficiently convert syngas into light olefins, even with a low H2/CO ratio, opening new avenues for syngas-to-olefin technologies.

B基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络做出了重大贡献，通过促进各种产品的形成。表面和气相反应之间的协同作用提高了催化剂性能，并有助于反应条件的优化。这种理解使设计能够高效地将合成气转化为轻质烯烃的催化剂成为可能，即使合成气的H2/CO比很低，也为合成气到烯烃技术开辟了新的途径。
