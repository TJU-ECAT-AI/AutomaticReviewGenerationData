            The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

            The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios. The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency.

            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the unique antioxidant property of boron-based catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to develop more stable catalysts. Additionally, optimizing the structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface to achieve higher propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates could be another direction. There is also potential for enhancing the multifunctionality of the catalysts to improve the efficiency of the ODHP reaction and broaden its application in the conversion of various feedstocks, including those derived from coal and biomass. The potential for using boron-based catalysts in tandem with bifunctional catalysts or combining them with vanadium oxide on boron nitride could further expand the scope of applications and optimize the reaction conditions for maximum efficiency.
