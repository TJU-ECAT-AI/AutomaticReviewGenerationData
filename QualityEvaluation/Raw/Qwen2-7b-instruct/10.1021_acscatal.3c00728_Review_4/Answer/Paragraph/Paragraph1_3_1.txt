        The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergy among different reaction pathways has profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. For instance, the highest propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates were achieved with specific chromium oxide/silica catalysts, suggesting that optimizing the structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface could lead to more efficient catalysts. By integrating the catalytic properties with the state of chromium, researchers can gain insights into how to tailor catalysts for optimal performance in the ODHP reaction.

        The ODHP process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This leads to a C2=C4= selectivity that surpasses the best value reported for FTTO (61%) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS. An even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%) was observed, with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4).

        The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism also contributes to understanding the overall reaction network by highlighting the role of surface and gas-phase reactions in influencing the probability of cracking. The reactivity of olefins relative to paraffins under realistic conditions, along with the impact of parameters such as site density and temperature, plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of B-based catalysts and enhancing propylene yield. The ability of certain catalysts, like Y zeolite, to govern hydrogen-transfer reactions under specific conditions also provides insights into optimizing the reaction network.

        Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system. The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency.

        The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously.

        The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, including both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have critical implications for improving catalyst performance and optimizing their design. The ability to tailor catalysts for optimal performance in the ODHP reaction, focusing on generating reactive species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, opens new avenues for the development of efficient syngas-to-olefin technologies. This approach not only minimizes fast consecutive surface oxidation steps but also promotes the formation of desired propyl radicals, leading to improved product distribution and selectivity.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook section suggests that future research efforts should focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies that leverage the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism. Potential areas of investigation include the development of novel catalyst compositions that can further enhance selectivity and activity, the optimization of reaction conditions to maximize the efficiency of the ODHP process, and the integration of surface and gas-phase chemistry to achieve more effective control over product distribution. By addressing these challenges, the field of ODHP catalysis stands poised to make significant strides in the efficient conversion of propane into propylene and other valuable olefinic compounds, paving the way for sustainable and scalable chemical manufacturing processes.

        硼基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）机制中的多维特性，结合表面和气体相自由基反应，显著提升了我们对整体反应网络的理解。这种不同反应路径间的协同作用对于催化剂性能和设计优化具有深远的影响。例如，通过特定的铬氧化物/二氧化硅催化剂，实现了最高的丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率，这表明优化氧化物粒子在支撑表面上的结构可以提高催化剂效率。通过将催化剂性能与铬的状态相关联，研究者能够深入了解如何根据ODHP反应调整催化剂设计以实现最佳性能。

        在ODHP过程中，双功能催化剂能够实现更高的转化率并避免失活。部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活CO和H2，并在沸石的受限酸性孔内进行CC耦合，导致了超过FTTO报告的最佳值（61%）的C2=C4选择性，并超过了典型FTS预测的最大C2C4烃选择性。观察到C2=C4选择性甚至更高（80%），总体C2C4选择性达到94%，仅产生2%的CH4，这是在均匀复合催化剂（模式4）下的结果。

        ODHP机制的多维特性还帮助我们理解了表面和气体相反应在影响裂解概率方面的作用。在实际FCC条件下，烯烃相对于烷烃的高反应活性，以及参数如站点密度和温度的影响，在优化B基催化剂性能和提高丙烯产量方面起着关键作用。某些催化剂，如Y沸石，能够根据特定条件控制氢转移反应，为优化反应网络提供了洞察。

        实现表面反应与气体自由基反应之间的协同效应对于增强ODHP反应机制的理解和设计更有效的B基催化系统至关重要。复合催化剂的高选择性和稳定性，在110小时的测试中得到验证，显示其工业应用潜力。结果显示，即使在长时间运行下，催化剂也能保持高C2C4选择性（94%）和低甲烷含量（2%），凸显其稳定性和高效性。

        这些协同效应的含义深远，对于催化剂性能和设计优化具有重大意义。通过整合表面和气体相反应，催化剂系统能够有效地管理在合成气向轻烯烃转换过程中的竞争路径。这导致了所需产品的更高选择性，减少了有害副产物如甲烷的形成，并提高了长期运行时的稳定性。使用部分还原的氧化物表面激活CO，结合沸石的受限酸性孔进行CC耦合，提供了一种灵活的方法来调整CO转化率和烯烃选择性。

        硼基催化剂在ODHP机制中的多维特性，包括表面和气体相自由基反应，显著提升了我们对整体反应网络的理解。这些机制的协同效应对改善催化剂性能和优化其设计具有关键影响。通过聚焦在促进二级CH键断裂的活性物种生成上，调整丙烷转化为丙烯的过程，这种方法不仅减少了表面连续氧化步骤的快速连续性，而且促进了预期的丙基自由基的形成，从而提高了产品分布和选择性。这一方法不仅使可持续和规模化化学制造过程成为可能，而且还开辟了开发高效合成气至烯烃技术的新途径。

        整体而言，ODHP反应机制的多维性质和硼基催化剂的协同作用为催化剂性能和设计提供了深刻见解，推动了该领域的研究方向。未来研究应致力于探索利用多维ODHP反应机制的新兴领域和创新方法，重点关注开发能进一步提高选择性和活性的新型催化剂成分、优化反应条件以最大化ODHP过程效率，以及整合表面和气体相化学以实现更有效的产品分布控制。通过解决这些挑战，ODHP催化领域有望取得重大突破，高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯和其他有价值的烯烃化合物，从而为可持续和可扩展的化学制造过程铺平道路。
