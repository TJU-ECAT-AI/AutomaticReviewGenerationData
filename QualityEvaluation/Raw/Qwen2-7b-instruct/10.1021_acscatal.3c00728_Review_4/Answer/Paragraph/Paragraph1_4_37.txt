                The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

                The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions highlight the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, indicating that the efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by both the surface properties of the catalyst and the behavior of radicals in the gas phase. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. For instance, the highest propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates were achieved with specific chromium oxide/silica catalysts, suggesting that optimizing the structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface could lead to more efficient catalysts. By correlating the catalytic properties with the state of chromium, researchers can gain insights into how to tailor catalysts for optimal performance in the ODHP reaction.
