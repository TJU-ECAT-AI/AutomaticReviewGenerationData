        The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. These synergistic effects underscore the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The interaction between surface reactions on boron nitride and gas-phase reactions plays a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process, allowing for enhanced propane conversion and improved product yield when catalyst performance and design are optimized.

        The comprehensive approach that integrates the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism provides insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of products. This leads to a deeper understanding of the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to achieve high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.

        Factors influencing surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

        The ability to tune the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component, coupled with the multifunctionality in managing both surface and gas-phase reactions, highlights the potential for versatile syngas-to-olefin technologies. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of the ODHP reaction but also enables the utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios, offering new avenues for syngas-to-olefin technologies.

        The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, demonstrated through extended testing, showcases its potential for industrial applications. The catalyst maintains high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. The catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

        The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, including both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface-initiated reactions and gas-phase radical propagation. This synergy explains the high selectivity of the process, particularly in forming propylene over ethylene, and provides insights into catalyst performance and design optimization.

        The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins, leading to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time.

        The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously, opening new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies.

        The operational drawbacks, such as the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking, necessitate careful optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst design to mitigate these issues.
