            The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These synergistic effects imply that the interaction between the surface reactions on the boron nitride and the gas-phase reactions plays a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process. By optimizing these interactions, one can enhance the performance of the catalyst, leading to more effective propane conversion and improved product yield.

            To understand the full scope of this reaction network, the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion is considered, dividing the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism. Studies focusing on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are initially explored to shed light on the unique properties of these catalysts. The radical reaction in the three-dimensional (3D) gas phase is recognized as playing a pivotal role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

            Based on the research summarized, attempts are made to plot the reaction networks correlating the surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions, as depicted in Figure 9. For various catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is typically identified as the tricoordination boron oxide/hydroxide (BOx(OH)3x) species, the initial boron species before the ODHP reaction exhibits differences. During the ODHP reaction, propane dehydrogenation primarily occurs through the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals.

            The surface reaction rate influences the gas-phase free radical processes, and conversely, the gas-phase radical reaction affects the surface reaction. A mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, describing how the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the catalyst surface acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which then undergo further reactions in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance for enhancing the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and designing more effective boron-based catalytic systems.

            氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）机制在硼基催化剂上的多维特性，既包括表面反应又涉及气相自由基反应，显著促进了对整体反应网络的理解。这些协同作用表明，硼氮化物表面反应与气相反应之间的相互作用在催化效率和选择性上起着关键作用。通过优化这些相互作用，可以提升催化剂性能，实现更高效的丙烷转化和产物产率的提高。

            为了理解这一反应网络的全貌，考虑了反应物分子运动的空间维度，并将反应机制分为两部分：表面反应机制和气体自由基反应机制。对六方硼氮化物（hBN）的研究是最初探索的重点，以揭示这些催化剂的独特性质。在三维（3D）气体中的自由基反应被认定为决定ODHP反应选择性的关键。

            根据总结的研究结果，尝试绘制了关联表面和气体自由基反应参与的ODHP反应网络，如图9所示。对于不同的催化剂体系，尽管最终催化位点通常被视为三配位硼氧化物/羟基（BOx(OH)3x）物种，但在ODHP反应前的初始硼物种有所不同。在ODHP反应期间，丙烷主要通过BO·和·OOH自由基活性物种的氢抽象过程进行脱氢。

            表面反应速率影响气体自由基过程，而气体自由基反应反过来也影响表面反应。已提出一种混合异质同质ODHP机制，描述了催化剂表面上的硼氧化物/羟基相作为形成烷基自由基的引发剂，这些自由基随后在气相中进一步反应。实现表面反应和气体自由基反应之间的协同作用对于增强ODHP反应机制的理解和设计更有效的硼基催化剂系统具有重要意义。
