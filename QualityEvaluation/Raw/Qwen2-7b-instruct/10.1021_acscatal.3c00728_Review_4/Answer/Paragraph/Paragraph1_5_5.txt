            The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. These mechanisms emphasize the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes to understanding the overall reaction network by highlighting the role of surface and gas-phase reactions in influencing the probability of cracking. The reactivity of olefins relative to paraffins under realistic conditions, along with the impact of parameters such as site density and temperature, plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of B-based catalysts and enhancing propylene yield. The ability of certain catalysts, like Y zeolite, to govern hydrogen-transfer reactions under specific conditions also provides insights into optimizing the reaction network. However, the operation faces a major drawback in the substantial increase in dry gas yield due to thermal cracking.

            The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. The highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst. The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface was studied by UVVis spectroscopy. The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium.

            To date, no mechanism exists that can explain both the unprecedented selectivity, the observed surface oxyfunctionalization, and the peculiar kinetic features of this reaction. We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. The remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase. This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts.

            The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B. We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4).

            A systematic analysis was performed of the physicochemical properties of amorphous silicas (Acros, Degussa, KSKG) and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared from them with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 wt % chromium. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. Their synergistic effects have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization.

            The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B. We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4).
