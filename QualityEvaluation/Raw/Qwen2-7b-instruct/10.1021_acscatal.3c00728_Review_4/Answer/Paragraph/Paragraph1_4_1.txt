                <p>The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This comprehensive approach allows for a more detailed understanding of how different reaction pathways interact, leading to enhanced catalyst performance and facilitating design optimizations.</p>
                <p>From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, the reaction mechanism is divided into two parts: the surface reaction mechanism and the gas radical reaction mechanism. Studies on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been conducted initially, highlighting the pivotal role of radical reactions in the 3-D gas phase for the selectivity of the ODHP reaction. Based on the aforementioned research summary, efforts have been made to correlate the surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions, as illustrated in Figure 9. This correlation reveals that, despite the final catalytic site being considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial boron species before the ODHP reaction varies across different catalyst systems. The dehydrogenation of propane primarily occurs through the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals. The surface reaction rate influences the gas-phase free radical processes, and conversely, the gas-phase radical reaction affects the surface reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which describes the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst as the initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective boron-based catalytic system.</p>
                <p>For various catalyst systems, while the final catalytic site is typically identified as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial boron species before the ODHP reaction differs. During the ODHP reaction, propane dehydrogenation predominantly takes place via the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by the reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals. The surface reaction rate impacts the gas-phase free radical processes, and similarly, the gas-phase radical reaction has an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, wherein the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the catalyst surface acts as the initiator to form alkyl radicals, which then undergo further reactions in the gas phase. It is imperative to achieve the synergy between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction to improve the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and optimize the design of boron-based catalytic systems.</p>

                <h3>Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook</h3>
                <p>Taking into account the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the synergies between surface and gas-phase reactions to enhance the performance of ODHP catalysts. By optimizing the interactions between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, researchers can tailor catalysts to achieve higher conversion rates and selectivities in the production of light olefins from syngas. This could involve the development of novel catalyst designs that integrate the most effective aspects of both surface and gas-phase reactions, thereby enabling the efficient conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable products. Moreover, the exploration of catalyst materials beyond boron-based systems, including but not limited to, metal oxides, supports, and their composites, could lead to the discovery of alternative catalysts with superior performance characteristics. Future studies might also delve into the integration of computational methods with experimental approaches to predict and optimize catalyst performance, paving the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for the oxidation dehydrogenation of alkanes.</p>
