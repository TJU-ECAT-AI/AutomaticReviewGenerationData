        The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which incorporates both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This comprehensive approach allows for a more detailed understanding of how different reaction pathways interact, leading to enhanced catalyst performance and facilitating design optimizations. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

        The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios. The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component further underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

        Looking ahead, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts suggests that there are numerous opportunities for future research and innovation. With a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions, scientists can tailor catalysts for optimal performance in various industrial settings. Potential areas of exploration might include the development of novel catalyst compositions that enhance specific reaction pathways, the optimization of operating conditions to maximize selectivity and yield, and the integration of advanced computational methods to predict and guide experimental design. Moreover, there is potential for cross-disciplinary collaborations, where insights from materials science, catalysis, and chemical engineering can be combined to address challenges in the design and implementation of efficient and sustainable energy conversion technologies. As the field continues to evolve, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts remains a cornerstone for advancing our understanding and capabilities in the realm of catalytic chemistry.
