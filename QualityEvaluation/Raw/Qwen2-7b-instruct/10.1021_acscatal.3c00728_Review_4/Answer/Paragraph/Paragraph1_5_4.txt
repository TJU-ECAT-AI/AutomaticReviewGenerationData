        The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding underscores the importance of considering both surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between surface reactions and gas-phase radical reactions play a pivotal role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas-phase reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions highlights the significance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Factors affecting surface and radical reactions, including reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions, are critical. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

        The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins, leading to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for carbon-carbon (CC) coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying hydrogen-to-carbon (H2/CO) ratios.

        The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in prolonged testing, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high selectivity for C2-C4 olefins (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the mesoporous silica-supported phosphorus (MSAPO) component underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

        Looking ahead, the field is poised to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies based on the insights gained from these studies. Future research endeavors might focus on:
        - Expanding the scope of reactants compatible with boron-based catalysts, potentially allowing for the conversion of a wider range of feedstocks.
        - Developing more efficient and selective catalysts through the optimization of surface chemistry and the design of novel materials.
        - Enhancing the understanding of reaction kinetics and mechanisms to predict and control product distributions more accurately.
        - Investigating the scalability and economic feasibility of large-scale ODHP processes to ensure commercial viability.
        - Exploring the integration of ODHP processes with other chemical transformations for the creation of value-added products from syngas.
