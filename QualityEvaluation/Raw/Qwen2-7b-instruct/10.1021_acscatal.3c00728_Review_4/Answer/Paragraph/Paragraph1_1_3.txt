            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1126/sciadv.aav8063]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.9b02284], [10.1021/jacsau.1c00542], and [10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00301]. The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

            The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios. The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component further underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

            Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units, offering the possibility to transform naphtha-range olefins into LPG olefins while reducing olefin content in FCC naphtha. Parameters such as site density or temperature influence cracking probability, demonstrating the reactivity of olefins with respect to corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions. Moreover, the reactivity of shorter chain olefins is found to be lower compared to longer chain olefins. The ability of certain catalysts, like Y zeolite, to govern hydrogen-transfer reactions under specific conditions provides insights into optimizing the reaction network. However, the operation faces a major drawback in the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking.

            The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This leads to a C2=C4= selectivity exceeding the best value reported for FTTO (61%) and surpassing the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS. Observations show even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%) with an overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst. By forming ketene, the reaction pathway of surface polymerization of CHx is blocked, hence circumventing the ASF limits of FTS. The olefin/paraffin ratio increases with the decreasing NH3 desorption temperature, reaching 4.7 for a MSAPO sample with NH3 desorption peak at 350C. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to understanding the overall reaction network by highlighting the role of surface and gas-phase reactions in influencing the probability of cracking. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process.

            The unique antioxidant property of boron-based catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes contributes significantly to the understanding of the overall reaction network. The multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism, including both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, has profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Understanding these effects leads to enhanced selectivity and activity.

            A systematic analysis of the physicochemical properties of amorphous silicas and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared with different chromium concentrations reveals that the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalysts exhibit the highest propylene selectivity (95%) and propane conversion (53%). The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface is studied by UVVis spectroscopy, and the catalytic properties are correlated with the state of chromium, providing insights into optimizing catalyst performance and design.

            The multiple promotional effects of vanadium oxide on boron nitride for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane imply that the interaction between surface reactions on boron nitride and gas-phase reactions plays a crucial role in enhancing catalyst performance and product yield. By optimizing these interactions, the performance of the catalyst can be significantly improved.

            Understanding the unique antioxidant property of boron-based catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the reaction network. The multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, has significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, including both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. Their synergistic effects have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, leading to enhanced selectivity and activity.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have critical implications for improving catalyst performance and optimizing their design.

            To date, no mechanism exists that can fully explain the unprecedented selectivity, observed surface oxyfunctionalization, and peculiar kinetic features of the reaction. Combining catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations suggests a bold new hypothesis. The remarkable product distribution can be explained by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, insights into reactions at both the surface and in the gas phase are sought. This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, contrasts sharply with mechanisms proposed for vanadium-based catalysts.

The synergistic effects of the multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, have been shown to significantly enhance catalyst performance and design optimization. This understanding not only deepens our knowledge of the intricate processes involved in the selective conversion of alkanes but also paves the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable catalyst systems.

            One of the key areas for future exploration is the fine-tuning of catalyst properties to maximize selectivity and activity. This could involve optimizing the catalyst composition, modifying the support materials, or adjusting the reaction conditions to achieve a more balanced interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions. For instance, the use of partially reduced oxide surfaces, as seen in ZnCrOx catalysts, offers a flexible platform to control the activation of reactants and the promotion of desired pathways. Similarly, the tailored acidity of zeolite components in composite catalysts plays a pivotal role in directing the selective coupling of carbon-carbon bonds.

This might include the development of hierarchical architectures, core-shell structures, or nanocomposites that can exploit the synergies between different catalytic sites and phases. The use of computational methods to predict and guide the synthesis of novel catalysts based on their expected performance in ODHP reactions could further accelerate this process.

            Furthermore, the scalability and industrial applicability of these catalysts must be addressed to ensure they can be effectively deployed in large-scale operations. This includes the optimization of reactor design, the assessment of catalyst stability over long periods, and the investigation of potential scaling-up challenges. The development of scalable manufacturing processes that maintain the performance characteristics of the catalysts across different scales is crucial for their commercial viability.

            Lastly, there is an opportunity to explore the integration of ODHP reactions with other chemical processes, such as hydrogenation or reforming, to create integrated catalytic systems capable of producing a wider range of valuable chemicals from renewable feedstocks. This could lead to the creation of more sustainable chemical production routes that minimize waste and optimize resource utilization.

            In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts represents a significant breakthrough in the field of catalysis. By leveraging the synergies between surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can design catalysts that not only enhance the efficiency of alkane conversion but also pave the way for the development of more sustainable and industrially viable chemical processes. The future of ODHP catalysis holds immense promise for advancing the chemical industry towards more environmentally friendly practices and technologies.
