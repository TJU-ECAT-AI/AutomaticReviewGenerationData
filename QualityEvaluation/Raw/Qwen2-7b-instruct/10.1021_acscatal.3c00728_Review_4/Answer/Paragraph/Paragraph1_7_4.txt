            <p>Accurate insights into the multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, as elucidated from a series of studies referenced by specific DOI numbers, highlight the integration of both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This comprehensive approach not only deepens our understanding of the intricate reaction network but also reveals the synergistic effects that significantly influence catalyst performance and design optimization.</p>
            
            <p>The multidimensional mechanism encompasses both the surface chemistry and the dynamics of radical reactions in the gas phase, offering a holistic view of the reaction pathways involved in ODHP. This understanding underscores the importance of considering the interplay between surface reactions and gas-phase radical propagation in optimizing catalyst performance. The synergistic effects of these reactions contribute to high activity and selectivity in the ODHP process, particularly in the selective formation of propene over ethylene.</p>
            
            <p>For instance, the studies highlight the role of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, followed by their sequential propagation in the gas phase, which is pivotal in achieving the high selectivity observed in ODHP. This process not only facilitates the efficient conversion of propane but also reduces the formation of unwanted byproducts, such as methane, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the catalyst.</p>
            
            <p>Moreover, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts enables researchers to tailor catalysts for optimal performance. By integrating surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins, leading to higher selectivity for desired products and improved stability over time. This approach opens new avenues for the development of advanced catalysts capable of efficiently utilizing coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying hydrogen-to-carbon ratios.</p>
            
            <p>Despite the significant achievements in understanding the mechanism of boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, several challenges remain, such as the detailed activation mechanism of alkanes and the interplay between different intermediates. Further research is needed to address these gaps and to optimize the design of more effective boron-based catalytic systems.</p>
            
            <p>Looking ahead, the field is poised to leverage the multidimensional understanding gained from these studies to innovate and develop syngas-to-olefin technologies. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions will continue to be a focal point in optimizing catalyst performance, enabling the efficient conversion of syngas to valuable light olefins with high selectivity and minimal byproduct formation.</p>
