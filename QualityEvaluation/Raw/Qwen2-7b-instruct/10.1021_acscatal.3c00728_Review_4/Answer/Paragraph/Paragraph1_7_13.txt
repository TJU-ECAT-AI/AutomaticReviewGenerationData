            <p>The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.</p>
            <p>Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units. With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced. Thus, parameters, such as site density or temperature, will have an influence on the cracking probability. The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated. Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins. As shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that at moderate temperature (723 and 823 K, transported bed), the hydrogen-transfer ability of the Y zeolite is the governing reaction. The major operational drawback of this operation would be the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking.</p>
            <p>The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B. We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4). By forming ketene, the reaction pathway of surface polymerization of CHx is blocked, hence circumventing the ASF limits of FTS. The olefin/paraffin ratio increased with the decreasing NH3 desorption temperature and reached 4.7 for a MSAPO sample with NH3 desorption peak at 350C (Fig. 3C).</p>

            <p>Understanding the Unique Antioxidation Property of Boron-Based Catalysts during Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkanes</p>
            <p>A systematic analysis was performed of the physicochemical properties of amorphous silicas (Acros, Degussa, KSKG) and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared from them with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 wt % chromium. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst. The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface was studied by UVVis spectroscopy. The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium.</p>
            <p>The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. Their synergistic effects have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization.</p>
            <p>To date, no mechanism exists that can explain both the unprecedented selectivity, the observed surface oxyfunctionalization, and the peculiar kinetic features of this reaction. We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. The remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase. This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts.</p>
