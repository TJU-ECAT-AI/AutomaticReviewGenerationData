            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

            The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios.

            The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component further underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts that can operate under milder conditions while maintaining high selectivity and activity, optimizing the design of catalyst supports to improve the stability and activity of the catalysts, and exploring the use of alternative metal promoters that can enhance the performance of B-based catalysts. Additionally, the integration of computational methods to predict and guide the design of catalysts based on the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanisms could revolutionize the field of catalysis, leading to the discovery of more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for the production of olefins from syngas.
