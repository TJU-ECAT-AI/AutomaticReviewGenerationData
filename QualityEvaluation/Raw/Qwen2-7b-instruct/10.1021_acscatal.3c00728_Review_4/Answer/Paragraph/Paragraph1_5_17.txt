            The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

            Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units. With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced. Thus, parameters, such as site density or temperature, will have an influence on the cracking probability. The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated. Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins. As shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that at moderate temperature (723 and 823 K, transported bed), the hydrogen-transfer ability of the Y zeolite is the governing reaction. The major operational drawback of this operation would be the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking.

            The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B. We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4). By forming ketene, the reaction pathway of surface polymerization of CHx is blocked, hence circumventing the ASF limits of FTS. The olefin/paraffin ratio increased with the decreasing NH3 desorption temperature and reached 4.7 for a MSAPO sample with NH3 desorption peak at 350C (Fig. 3C).

            Multiple promotional effects of vanadium oxide on boron nitride for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Understanding the unique antioxidant property of boron-based catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

            A systematic analysis was performed of the physicochemical properties of amorphous silicas (Acros, Degussa, KSKG) and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared from them with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 wt % chromium. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst. The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface was studied by UVVis spectroscopy. The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium.

            To date, no mechanism exists that can explain both the unprecedented selectivity, the observed surface oxyfunctionalization, and the peculiar kinetic features of this reaction. We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. The remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase. This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts.

            提高工艺严重性可以显著增加FCC单位的丙烯产量。采用此选项，芳烃范围内的烯烃可能转化为LPG烯烃，同时，FCC石脑油中的烯烃含量会减少。因此，参数如位点密度或温度将影响裂解概率。在现实的FCC裂解条件下，烯烃与对应的烷烃的高反应性已被证明。此外，观察到六碳以下的烯烃的反应性明显低于更长链烯烃的反应性。如图3所示，在适中的温度（723和823K，运输床）下，Y沸石的氢转移能力是决定性的反应。操作的主要缺点是由于热裂解导致干气产量的大幅增加。

            这个过程涉及一个双功能催化剂，它能实现更高的转化率并避免失活。部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活CO和H2，并在沸石的受限酸性孔内调节CC耦合。这个C2=C4=选择性高于FTTO的最佳值（61%）（4），超过典型FTS的ASF分布所预测的最大值C2C4烃类。我们观察到C2=C4=的更高选择性（80%），总C2C4选择性达到94%，仅2%CH4来自混合复合催化剂（模式4）。通过形成酮烯，表面聚合物化的CHx路径被阻断，从而绕过FTS的ASF限制。烯烃/烷烃比随着NH3脱附温度的降低而增加，达到4.7，对应于NH3脱附峰值在350C的MSAPO样品（图3C）。
