            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1126/sciadv.aav8063]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.9b02284], [10.1021/jacsau.1c00542], and [10.1134/S0036024418120403]. 

            The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These synergistic effects imply that the interaction between the surface reactions on the boron nitride and the gas-phase reactions plays a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process. By optimizing these interactions, one can enhance the performance of the catalyst, leading to more effective propane conversion and improved product yield.

            The comprehensive approach allows for a more detailed understanding of the reaction network, as seen in the division of the reaction mechanism into surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism. This highlights the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. This understanding emphasizes the need for a thorough integration of surface and gas-phase reactions to achieve optimal performance.

            For instance, the highest propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates were achieved with specific chromium oxide/silica catalysts, suggesting that optimizing the structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface could lead to more efficient catalysts. By correlating the catalytic properties with the state of chromium, researchers can gain insights into how to tailor catalysts for optimal performance in the ODHP reaction.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism also contributes to the understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface-initiated reactions and gas-phase radical propagation. This synergy explains the high selectivity of the process, particularly in forming propylene over ethylene, and provides insights into catalyst performance and design optimization. The implications of these synergistic effects are significant for catalyst performance and design optimization, enabling the efficient conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity.

            Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective boron-based catalytic system. This not only improves the conversion and selectivity but also contributes to the development of more versatile syngas-to-olefin technologies.

            Looking towards the future, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts holds promise for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can optimize the performance of these catalysts, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying hydrogen-to-carbon (H2/CO) ratios. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of the petrochemical industry.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, enabling the efficient conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity. The multidisciplinary approach combining catalytic activity measurements, quantum chemical calculations, and experimental observations provides a robust framework for advancing the field of catalysis and unlocking the full potential of boron-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
