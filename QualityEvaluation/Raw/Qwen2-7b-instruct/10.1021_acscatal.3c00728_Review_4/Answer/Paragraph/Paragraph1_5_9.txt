            <p>Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown. From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, the reaction mechanism is divided into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism. Mechanism studies about the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are first explored. The radical reaction in the three-dimensional (3-D) gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction. On the basis of the aforementioned research summary, we have attempted to plot the reaction networks to correlate the surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions, as shown in Figure 9. For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different. During the ODHP reaction, the dehydrogenation of propane mainly occurs via the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by the reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals. The surface reaction rate affects the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction also has an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system.</p>
            <p>Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts to develop catalysts with optimized performance for a variety of applications, including the selective production of light olefins from syngas. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions offer a promising avenue for tailoring catalysts to achieve high activity and selectivity, especially when considering factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of the ODHP process but also paves the way for the development of versatile technologies that can utilize coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying hydrogen-to-carbon (H2/CO) ratios. By optimizing catalyst performance and design based on a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms, it becomes possible to achieve robust and efficient conversion of feedstocks into valuable products, thereby contributing to sustainable chemical synthesis and energy production.</p>

            <p>尽管在B基催化剂的氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应机制方面取得了显著成就，但整个反应网络、烷烃的详细激活方式以及不同中间体之间的相互作用仍然未知。从反应物分子运动的空间维度出发，将反应机制分为两部分：表面反应机制和气相自由基反应机制。关于六方硼氮（hBN）的机制研究首先被探讨。在三维度（3-D）气体相中的自由基反应对ODHP反应的选择性起着重要作用。在上述研究综述的基础上，我们尝试绘制了涉及ODHP反应的表面和气相自由基反应的反应网络图，如图9所示。对于不同的催化剂体系，虽然最终催化位点被认为是BOx(OH)3x物种的三配位，但在ODHP反应前的初始B物种有所不同。在ODHP反应过程中，丙烷主要通过BO·和·OOH自由基从丙烷中脱氢。表面反应速率影响气体自由基过程，而气体自由基反应也对表面反应有不利影响。混合异质同质ODHP机制已被提出，可以描述为催化剂表面上的硼氧化物/羟基相作为引发剂形成烷基自由基，这些自由基进一步在气体相中反应。实现表面反应和气体自由基反应的协同作用对于增强ODHP反应机制的理解以及设计更有效的B基催化剂系统具有重要意义。</p>
            <p>综合理解和前景展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来的研究努力可能集中在利用ODHP反应机制的多维特性来开发具有优化性能的催化剂，以满足各种应用需求，包括从合成气选择性生产轻质烯烃。表面与气相反应的协同效应为定制催化剂以实现高活性和选择性提供了一个有希望的方向，特别是在考虑反应条件、催化剂床配置以及表面与气相反应之间的平衡等因素时。这种方法不仅提高了ODHP过程的效率，而且为利用煤炭和生物质衍生的合成气（H2/CO比例各异）开发多功能技术铺平了道路。通过基于全面理解反应机制来优化催化剂性能和设计，有可能实现稳定且高效的原料转化为有价值的产物，从而对可持续化学合成和能源生产做出贡献。</p>
