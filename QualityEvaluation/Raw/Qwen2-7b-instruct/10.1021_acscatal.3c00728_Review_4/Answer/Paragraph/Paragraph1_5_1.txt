            The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have critical implications for improving catalyst performance and optimizing their design. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios.

            The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface-initiated reactions and gas-phase radical propagation. This synergy explains the high selectivity of the process, particularly in forming propylene over ethylene, and provides insights into catalyst performance and design optimization. The implications of these synergistic effects are significant for catalyst performance and design optimization, enabling the efficient conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity. By integrating surface and gas-phase chemistry, researchers can tailor catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the ODHP, focusing on generating reactive species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane. This approach minimizes fast consecutive surface oxidation steps and promotes the formation of desired propyl radicals, leading to improved product distribution and selectivity.
