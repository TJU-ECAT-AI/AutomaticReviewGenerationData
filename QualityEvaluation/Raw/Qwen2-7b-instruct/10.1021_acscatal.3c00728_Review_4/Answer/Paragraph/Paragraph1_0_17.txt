                The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enriches our understanding of the overall reaction network. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of considering both surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system, thereby enhancing catalyst performance and enabling design optimizations. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a pivotal role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain profound insights into the intricate interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This holistic view illuminates the pathways through which alkanes undergo dehydrogenation, providing a foundational framework for predicting and controlling product distributions. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions highlights the significance of coupling these processes efficiently to achieve high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Factors influencing the surface and radical reactions, including reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions, necessitate a comprehensive understanding to optimize catalyst performance and design. Enhancing catalyst performance and design optimization requires a thorough grasp of the interactions and influences between these two-dimensional processes.

                The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts contributes to understanding the overall reaction network by highlighting the role of surface and gas-phase reactions in influencing the probability of cracking. The reactivity of olefins relative to paraffins under realistic conditions, alongside the impact of parameters such as site density and temperature, plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of boron-based catalysts and enhancing propylene yield. The ability of certain catalysts, like Y zeolite, to govern hydrogen-transfer reactions under specific conditions also offers insights into optimizing the reaction network. However, the operation faces a significant challenge in the substantial increase in dry gas yield due to thermal cracking.

                The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts facilitates the precise control over carbon-carbon coupling, essential for selective production of light olefins from syngas. The catalyst design optimizes carbon monoxide activation and carbon-carbon coupling, enabling high conversions and selectivities in light olefin production. The synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for the efficient management of competing pathways, resulting in high olefin selectivity, reduced methane formation, and improved catalyst stability over time. The ability to adjust the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component offers flexibility in product customization, and the catalyst's multifunctionality in managing both surface and gas-phase reactions underscores its potential for versatile syngas-to-olefin technologies.

                The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts contributes significantly to the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface-initiated reactions and gas-phase radical propagation. This synergy explains the high selectivity of the process, particularly in forming propylene over ethylene, and provides insights into catalyst performance and design optimization. The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization, enabling the efficient conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity. By integrating surface and gas-phase chemistry, researchers can tailor catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the ODHP, focusing on generating reactive species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane. This approach minimizes fast consecutive surface oxidation steps and promotes the formation of desired propyl radicals, leading to improved product distribution and selectivity.
