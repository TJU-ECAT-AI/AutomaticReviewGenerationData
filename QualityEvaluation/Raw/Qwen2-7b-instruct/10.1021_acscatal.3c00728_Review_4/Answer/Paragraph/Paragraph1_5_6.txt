                    Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1126/sciadv.aav8063\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.9b02284\], \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_4\], and \[10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.109\].
                    The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions highlight the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, indicating that the efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by both the surface properties of the catalyst and the behavior of radicals in the gas phase. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, leading to enhanced selectivity and activity.
                    The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins, leading to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of boron-based catalysts, with optimized surface functionalities and controlled gas-phase radical reactions, represents a promising avenue for advancing the efficiency and selectivity in the production of propylene from propane.
                    Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective boron-based catalytic system.
                    The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file have opened up new avenues for exploring the synergies between surface and gas-phase reactions in ODHP processes. Future research should focus on developing catalysts that can dynamically control the balance between surface reactions and gas-phase radical propagation, aiming to optimize the selectivity and stability of the catalytic system. By leveraging the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism, researchers can engineer catalysts that are capable of selectively converting feedstocks into desired products with high efficiency and selectivity. The exploration of novel boron-based materials and the integration of advanced synthesis techniques hold promise for the discovery of catalysts with enhanced properties and improved performance. Moreover, the application of computational methods, such as quantum chemistry calculations, can provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of these complex reactions, guiding the rational design of catalysts. The development of efficient and sustainable ODHP processes, with the potential for utilizing renewable feedstocks like biomass-derived syngas, represents a promising direction for future research and industrial applications.
