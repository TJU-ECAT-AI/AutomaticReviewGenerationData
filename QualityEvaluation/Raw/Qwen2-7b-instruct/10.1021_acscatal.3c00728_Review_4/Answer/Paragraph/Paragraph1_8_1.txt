                    The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the role of surface and gas-phase reactions in influencing the probability of cracking. The reactivity of olefins relative to paraffins under realistic conditions, along with the impact of parameters such as site density and temperature, plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of B-based catalysts and enhancing propylene yield. The ability of certain catalysts, like Y zeolite, to govern hydrogen-transfer reactions under specific conditions also provides insights into optimizing the reaction network.
