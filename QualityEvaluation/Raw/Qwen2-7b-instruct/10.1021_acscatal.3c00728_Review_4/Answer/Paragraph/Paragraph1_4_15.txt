            <p>Detailed analysis established from the study of reference <doi:10.1126/sciadv.aav8063>. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references <doi:10.1021/acscatal.9b02284> and <doi:10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_4>. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.</p>
            <p>The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These processes enable precise control over CC coupling, crucial for selective production of light olefins from syngas. The catalyst's design optimizes CO activation and CC coupling, facilitating high conversions and selectivities in light olefin production. The synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for the efficient management of competing pathways, resulting in high olefin selectivity, reduced methane formation, and improved catalyst stability over time. The ability to tune the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component offers flexibility in product customization, and the catalyst's multifunctionality in managing both surface and gas-phase reactions highlights its potential for versatile syngas-to-olefin technologies.</p>
            <p>From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism. Mechanism studies about the hexagonal BN are first explored. The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction. On the basis of the aforementioned research summary, we have attempted to plot the reaction networks to correlate the surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions, as shown in Figure 9. For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different. During the ODHP reaction, the dehydrogenation of propane mainly occurs via the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by the reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system.</p>
            <p>Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units. With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced. Thus, parameters, such as site density or temperature, will have an influence on the cracking probability. The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated. Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins. As shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that at moderate temperature (723 and 823 K, transported bed), the hydrogen-transfer ability of the Y zeolite is the governing reaction. The major operational drawback of this operation would be the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking.</p>
            <p>The process involves a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites. This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B. We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4). By forming ketene, the reaction pathway of surface polymerization of CHx is blocked, hence circumventing the ASF limits of FTS. The olefin/paraffin ratio increased with the decreasing NH3 desorption temperature and reached 4.7 for a MSAPO sample with NH3 desorption peak at 350C (Fig. 3C).</p>
            <p>Multiple Promotional Effects of Vanadium Oxide on Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane highlights the unique antioxidant property of boron-based catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Understanding the unique antioxidant property of boron-based catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves comprehending the complex interplay between surface reactions on boron nitride and gas-phase reactions, which significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These synergistic effects imply that the interaction between the surface reactions on the boron nitride and the gas-phase reactions plays a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process. By optimizing these interactions, one can enhance the performance of the catalyst, leading to more effective propane conversion and improved product yield.</p>
            <p>A systematic analysis was performed of the physicochemical properties of amorphous silicas (Acros, Degussa, KSKG) and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared from them with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 wt % chromium. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst. The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface was studied by UVVis spectroscopy. The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium.</p>

Implications of these effects for catalyst performance and design optimization include enhanced selectivity and activity.</p>
            <p>To date, no mechanism exists that can explain both the unprecedented selectivity, the observed surface oxyfunctionalization, and the peculiar kinetic features of this reaction. We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. The remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase. This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts.</p>
