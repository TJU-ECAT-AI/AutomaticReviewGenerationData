            <h3>The Multidimensional Nature of the ODHP Reaction Mechanism in B-Based Catalysts: Integrating Surface and Gas-Phase Radical Reactions</h3>
            <p>Recent studies have elucidated the multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which incorporates both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This comprehensive approach significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network, allowing for a more detailed insight into how different reaction pathways interact and contribute to catalyst performance.</p>
            <p>Key findings include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surface reactions and gas-phase radical reactions synergistically contribute to the high activity and selectivity of the ODHP process, particularly in the formation of propylene over ethylene.</li>
                <li>The interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and design, leading to enhanced selectivity and activity.</li>
                <li>Theoretical and experimental evidence supports the notion that the surface initiates free-radical gas-phase reactions, a phenomenon distinct from those observed in vanadium-based catalysts.</li>
                <li>Theoretical models and computational simulations have provided a framework for understanding the complex interactions between surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase propagation, leading to the development of more effective B-based catalysts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These synergistic effects have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, enabling the efficient conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity. By integrating surface and gas-phase chemistry, researchers can tailor catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the ODHP reaction, focusing on generating reactive species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Developing novel catalyst architectures that exploit the synergies between surface and gas-phase reactions to achieve higher conversion and selectivity.</li>
                <li>Investigating the impact of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, on the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions, to optimize catalyst performance.</li>
                <li>Expanding the scope of B-based catalysts to include other boron compounds and heteroatom-containing materials to broaden the applicability of ODHP technology.</li>
                <li>Enhancing computational methods to accurately predict and model the complex interactions between surface and gas-phase reactions, guiding the rational design of catalysts.</li>
