        The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

        The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios. The composite catalyst's high selectivity and stability, as demonstrated in the 110-hour test, showcase its potential for industrial applications. The results indicate that the catalyst can maintain high C2C4 selectivity (94%) and low methane content (2%) even under prolonged operation, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. Additionally, the catalyst's performance in converting ketene directly to light olefins through the MSAPO component further underscores the importance of the catalyst's multifunctionality and the interplay between its components in achieving optimal reaction outcomes.

        Looking ahead, the field of ODHP catalysts presents several promising areas for future exploration and innovation. The potential for leveraging advanced materials science and computational methods to design catalysts with tailored properties is vast. The integration of machine learning algorithms to predict catalyst performance based on structural parameters could revolutionize the way catalysts are developed. Moreover, the exploration of novel catalyst architectures, such as hierarchical structures or core-shell configurations, might offer new possibilities for enhancing both activity and selectivity. The development of more sustainable synthesis routes for syngas and the optimization of reactor designs to better accommodate the unique requirements of ODHP processes are also critical areas of interest. Ultimately, the continued advancement in understanding and optimizing the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts holds great promise for expanding the scope and efficiency of light olefin production from renewable feedstocks, contributing to a more sustainable chemical industry.
