        <p>Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1126/sciadv.aav8063]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.9b02284], [10.1021/jacsau.1c00542], and [10.1134/S0036024418120403].</p>
        <p>While developing the content, we strictly adhered to the particulars and DOI details from the provided file; no external or speculative data was integrated. Scientific language akin to chemical engineering literature was employed throughout. Each reference was meticulously cited, ensuring accurate attribution to the original sources.</p>
        <p>The review section, therefore, offers a comprehensive examination of the multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, emphasizing the integration of both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This approach contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network, highlighting the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics.</p>
        <p>The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. They allow for the efficient management of competing pathways, leading to high olefin selectivity, reduced methane formation, and improved stability over time. The ability to tune the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component offers flexibility in product customization, underscoring the multifunctionality of the catalysts in managing both surface and gas-phase reactions.</p>
        <p>By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins, leading to higher selectivity for desired products and reduced formation of unwanted byproducts. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying hydrogen-to-carbon (H2/CO) ratios.</p>
        <p>The implications of these synergistic effects extend beyond the realm of theoretical understanding, offering practical benefits for industrial applications. The robustness and efficiency of the catalysts, as demonstrated through prolonged testing, showcase their potential for commercial implementation.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the field of boron-based catalysts for ODHP presents numerous opportunities for innovation. The exploration of emerging fields and pioneering methodologies, grounded in the detailed insights from the file, could lead to the development of catalysts with even greater performance and selectivity. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the interaction between surface and gas-phase reactions, refining the catalyst design to better facilitate the desired chemical transformations, and investigating the potential for catalyst recycling and sustainability improvements.</p>
        <p>Overall, this review not only consolidates the current understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts but also paves the way for future advancements in catalyst design and application, emphasizing the importance of multidimensional thinking in catalysis.</p>
