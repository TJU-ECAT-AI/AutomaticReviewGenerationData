"It has been well established that the conversion of light hydrocarbons occurs via carbenium ion chemistry."
          "First, a carbenium ion is generated, either by addition of a proton on a double bond or by the addition of a proton on a saturated molecule, forming a pentacoordinated ion, which immediately cracks yielding a carbenium ion and a paraffin."
          "Then, the carbenium ion cracks yielding olefins and a smaller carbenium ion (monomolecular mechanism) or acts as an active site by reacting with a feed molecule (bimolecular mechanism) forming a larger molecule that further cracks."
          "Finally, the carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, thus, restoring the initial active site."
          "This mechanism, called chain mechanism, has been useful to explain the conversion of small paraffins."
          "As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins."
          "Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular)."
          "This second step can lead to a paraffin together with a more dehydrogenated carbenium ion (hydrogen transfer) or form a C10C14 carbenium ion that can then cycle and lead after cracking and dehydrogenation to a C7C11 aromatic and a corresponding amount of hydrogen or paraffins (dimerization-cracking)."
          "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
          "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
          "Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation."
          "Thus, a bimolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to the formation of aromatics from the naphthenes, since the carbenium may be directly formed from the feed molecule through a hydride transfer, while a monomolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to short olefins."

[1] "The conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid fuels or chemicals often proceeds through the production of CO and H2. This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts."
          [2] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
          [3] "Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong)."

          [5] "This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties."
          [6] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
          [7] "No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours."
          [8] "Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."
          [9] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1)."
          [10] "Figure 1A shows that C2=C4= selectivity reached 74% at CO conversion of 16% over a catalyst with a mass ratio of ZnCrOx/MSAPO = 1.4, under reaction conditions of H2/CO = 1.5, pressure 2.5 MPa, and space velocity 4800 ml/h·gcat."
          [11] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
          [12] "The reactivity of this composite catalyst showed good reproducibility, with CO conversion and selectivity fluctuating within 4 and 5%, respectively, among 11 tests (fig. S3)."
          [13] "Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C)."
          [14] "Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15)."
          [15] "We attribute the efficiency of the OX-ZEO process to the bifunctionality of the catalyst, with two types of active sites exhibiting complementary and compatible properties."
          [16] "Activation of the CO bond has been reported previously for surfaces promoted with oxygen vacanciesfor example, Fe3O4 (16), CoOx/TiO2 (17), Cu/ZnO (0001) (18), and ZnGa2O4 (19)."
          [17] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the ZnCr2O4 spinel (111) surface as a model reveal that it is reducible, resulting in a surface with a number of oxygen vacancies (figs. S5 and S6) (9)."
          [18] "In situ near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) of ZnCrOx surface (Fig. 2B) revealed a new signal with a lower Zn3d binding energy upon exposure to H2 and CO, compared with the initial oxidized surface."

"It has been well established that the conversion of light hydrocarbons occurs via carbenium ion chemistry."
          "First, a carbenium ion is generated, either by addition of a proton on a double bond or by the addition of a proton on a saturated molecule, forming a pentacoordinated ion, which immediately cracks yielding a carbenium ion and a paraffin."
          "Then, the carbenium ion cracks yielding olefins and a smaller carbenium ion (monomolecular mechanism) or acts as an active site by reacting with a feed molecule (bimolecular mechanism) forming a larger molecule that further cracks."
          "Finally, the carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, thus, restoring the initial active site."
          "This mechanism, called chain mechanism, has been useful to explain the conversion of small paraffins."
          "As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins."
          "Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular)."
          "This second step can lead to a paraffin together with a more dehydrogenated carbenium ion (hydrogen transfer) or form a C10C14 carbenium ion that can then cycle and lead after cracking and dehydrogenation to a C7C11 aromatic and a corresponding amount of hydrogen or paraffins (dimerization-cracking)."
          "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
          "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
          "Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation."
          "Thus, a bimolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to the formation of aromatics from the naphthenes, since the carbenium may be directly formed from the feed molecule through a hydride transfer, while a monomolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to short olefins."

[1] "The conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid fuels or chemicals often proceeds through the production of CO and H2. This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts."
          [2] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
          [3] "Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong)."
          [4] "A zinc-chromium oxide creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite."
          [5] "This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties."
          [6] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
          [7] "No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours."
          [8] "Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."
          [9] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1)."
          [10] "Figure 1A shows that C2=C4= selectivity reached 74% at CO conversion of 16% over a catalyst with a mass ratio of ZnCrOx/MSAPO = 1.4, under reaction conditions of H2/CO = 1.5, pressure 2.5 MPa, and space velocity 4800 ml/h·gcat."
          [11] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
          [12] "The reactivity of this composite catalyst showed good reproducibility, with CO conversion and selectivity fluctuating within 4 and 5%, respectively, among 11 tests (fig. S3)."
          [13] "Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C)."
