The ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. It explains the conversion of light hydrocarbons through carbenium ion chemistry, starting with the generation of a carbenium ion by adding a proton to a double bond or a saturated molecule, leading to immediate cracking and the formation of a paraffin. Subsequent reactions, including monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms, involve the cracking of the carbenium ion into olefins and smaller carbenium ions, or acting as an active site by reacting with a feed molecule to form larger molecules that further crack. The carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, restoring the initial active site. This chain mechanism is useful in explaining the conversion of small paraffins. The mechanism also accounts for the preferential cracking of naphthenes into smaller olefins and the formation of aromatics from methylcyclohexene through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation. The balance between monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms is influenced by factors such as site density and temperature, affecting the probability of cracking.

The ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, with its multidimensional nature encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism allows for precise control over CC coupling, essential for selective production of light olefins from syngas. The catalyst design optimizes CO activation and CC coupling, leading to high conversions and selectivities in light olefin production. The synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions enables effective management of competing pathways, resulting in high olefin selectivity, reduced methane formation, and improved catalyst stability over time. The ability to tune the olefin/paraffin ratio through the acidity of the zeolite component offers flexibility in product customization, and the catalyst's multifunctionality in managing both surface and gas-phase reactions highlights its potential for versatile syngas-to-olefin technologies.

          The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By integrating both surface and gas-phase reactions, the catalyst system can effectively manage competing pathways involved in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. This leads to higher selectivity for desired products, reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, and improved stability over time. The use of a partially reduced oxide surface for CO activation, combined with the zeolite's confined acidic pores for CC coupling, enables a flexible approach to adjusting CO conversion and olefin selectivity simultaneously. This opens new avenues for the development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, potentially enabling the efficient utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with varying H2/CO ratios.
