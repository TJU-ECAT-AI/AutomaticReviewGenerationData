The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism on boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the entire reaction network. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions contributes to improved catalyst performance and offers opportunities for optimizing catalyst design.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions over boron-based catalysts, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding is crucial as it reveals the intricate interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which significantly impacts catalyst performance. The synergistic effects of these reactions imply that optimizing one aspect could enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts, leading to improved performance in the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons or other valuable products.

The addition of water to the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts enhances the rates of existing pathways, indicating its potential role in facilitating the formation of intermediates that react in the gas phase. This finding suggests that water might play a significant role in the reaction network by participating in the formation of reactive intermediates. In the context of B6O3#2, it emerges as a promising candidate for its capability to chemisorb and activate O2 into stable BO. radicals, which can abstract a hydrogen atom from propane, as well as activate water into BH, a species that can react with O2 to form a free HOO. radical. Our proposed reaction mechanism underscores the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry and surface-mediated reactions in understanding and optimizing catalyst performance, highlighting the synergistic effects that contribute to the efficiency of the ODHP process and the formation of desired products.
