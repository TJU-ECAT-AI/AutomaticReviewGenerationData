          [1] "Multiple Promotional Effects of Vanadium Oxide on Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane"
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These synergistic effects imply that the interaction between the surface reactions on the boron nitride and the gas-phase reactions plays a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process. By optimizing these interactions, one can enhance the performance of the catalyst, leading to more effective propane conversion and improved product yield.
