[1] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B). When the supported vanadia catalyst is used, the main by-products are COx, which account for 33% of total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion. Conversely, when BN materials are used, the main by-product is ethene, a highly valuable olefin itself, rather than COx."
[2] "The high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology (15, 21)."
[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."
[4] "The proposed intermediate structures and energies of the overall catalytic cycle are included in fig. S11. We envision that a second abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a primary carbon follows another radical rebound, and creates a di-propoxyl intermediate. Desorption of propene and the reorganization of hydrogen atoms along the edge form water as a side product."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This synergy contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The surface reactions facilitated by the one-dimensional (1D) oxygen-terminated armchair BN edges prevent the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of zero-dimensional (0D) single-site catalysts. Moreover, the stabilization of adsorbed species by the nitroxyl radical site suppresses overoxidation, a common issue in two-dimensional (2D) surface catalysts. The implication for catalyst performance and design optimization lies in achieving high olefin selectivity through a finely balanced interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase reactivity, leading to enhanced efficiency and reduced waste production.

多维性质的ODHP反应机制在硼基催化剂上涉及表面和气相自由基反应的协同作用，这有助于全面理解整个反应网络。通过一维（1D）氧终止的臂椅BN边缘的表面反应，可以避免形成零维（0D）单点催化剂中常见的高度活性丙基自由基。此外，通过硝基自由基站点对吸附物种的稳定作用抑制了过氧化，这是二维（2D）表面催化剂中常见的一种问题。催化剂性能和设计优化的含义在于，通过表面化学和气相反应之间的精细平衡实现高烯烃选择性，从而提高效率并减少废物产生。
