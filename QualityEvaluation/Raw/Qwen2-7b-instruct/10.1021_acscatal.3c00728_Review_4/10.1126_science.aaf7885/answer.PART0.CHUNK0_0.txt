[1] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction."
[2] "This site shows similarities to work in the semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (28), as well as the proposed active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidations (10, 11)."
[3] "These >BOON< sites can be viewed as inorganic peroxide species able to perform oxidation reactions."
[4] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C)."
[5] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the specific roles and interactions of various components involved in the process. The oxygen-terminated armchair BN edges serve as active sites for the reaction, allowing for the efficient abstraction of hydrogen atoms from propane, leading to the formation of B-OH species and nitroxyl radicals. This one-dimensional (1D) structure prevents the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of zero-dimensional (0D) single-site catalysts, thereby reducing the risk of overoxidation. Additionally, the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site enhances the selectivity towards olefin products. The synergistic effects of these surface and gas-phase reactions optimize catalyst performance by balancing reactivity and selectivity, leading to improved olefin yields and stability during the reaction.

The implications of these synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization include the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction. By understanding the specific roles of the active sites and the mechanisms governing the reaction pathways, researchers can tailor catalyst designs to maximize olefin selectivity and minimize unwanted byproducts. This knowledge also facilitates the prediction and control of reaction outcomes, enabling the fine-tuning of operating conditions for optimal yield and efficiency. Furthermore, the insights gained from this study can inform the design of catalysts for other oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, potentially expanding the scope of sustainable chemical synthesis processes.

多维性质的ODHP反应机制，跨越B基催化剂的表面和气相自由基反应，对我们理解整体反应网络做出了贡献，通过阐明参与过程的各种成分的具体作用和相互作用。氧终止的臂链BN边缘作为反应活性位点，允许从丙烷中高效地提取氢原子，导致B-OH物种和亚硝基自由基的形成。这种一维（1D）结构避免了零维（0D）单个催化剂位点通常形成的高度反应性的丙基自由基，从而减少了过氧化的风险。此外，丙基自由基通过亚硝基自由基位点的稳定提高了烯烃产物的选择性。

这些表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的含义包括开发更高效和选择性更好的催化剂用于ODHP反应。通过理解活性位点的具体作用和反应途径的机制，研究人员可以调整催化剂设计以最大化烯烃选择性和最小化副产品的生成。这也有助于预测和控制反应结果，使操作条件的微调成为可能，以实现最佳的产率和效率。此外，从这项研究中获得的知识可以指导催化剂的设计，适用于其他氧化脱氢反应，有可能扩展可持续化学合成过程的范围。
