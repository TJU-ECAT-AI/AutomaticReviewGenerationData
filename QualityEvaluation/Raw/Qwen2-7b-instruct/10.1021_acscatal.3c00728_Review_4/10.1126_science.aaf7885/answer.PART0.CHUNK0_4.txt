[1] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction."
[2] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C)."
[3] "This is drastically different from a 0D site (e.g., V/SiO2), which most likely creates a reactive propyl radical (34), or a 2D site [e.g., Cu(111) surface] where diffusion of adsorbates is unrestricted (35), both prone to overoxidation."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism contrasts sharply with traditional single-site catalysts (0D, e.g., V/SiO2) and surface catalysts (2D, e.g., Cu(111)), which tend to create reactive propyl radicals or allow unrestricted diffusion of adsorbates, leading to overoxidation. By avoiding the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppressing overoxidation of adsorbed species, the proposed one-dimensional (1D) active site ensures better control over the reaction pathway, resulting in high olefin selectivity. This understanding has implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, potentially enabling more efficient and selective synthesis of propene from propane through oxidative dehydrogenation.

多维的ODHP反应机制在硼基催化剂上，结合表面和气相自由基反应，极大地丰富了我们对整体反应网络的理解。与传统的单个催化点（0D，如V/SiO2）和表面催化剂（2D，如Cu(111)表面）相比，这些传统催化剂倾向于生成活性丙基自由基或允许吸附物的无限制扩散，从而导致过氧化。通过避免形成高度活性的丙基自由基并抑制吸附物种的过氧化，所提出的单维（1D）活性位点确保了对反应路径更好的控制，从而实现了高烯烃选择性。这一理解对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义，可能使从丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢合成更加高效和选择性。
