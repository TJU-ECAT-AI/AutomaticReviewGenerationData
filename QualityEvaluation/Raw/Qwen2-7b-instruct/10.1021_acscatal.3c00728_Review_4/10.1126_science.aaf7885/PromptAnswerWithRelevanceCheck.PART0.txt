[1] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction."
[2] "This site shows similarities to work in the semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (28), as well as the proposed active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidations (10, 11)."
[3] "These >BOON< sites can be viewed as inorganic peroxide species able to perform oxidation reactions."
[4] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C)."
[5] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the specific roles and interactions of various components involved in the process. The oxygen-terminated armchair BN edges serve as active sites for the reaction, allowing for the efficient abstraction of hydrogen atoms from propane, leading to the formation of B-OH species and nitroxyl radicals. This one-dimensional (1D) structure prevents the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of zero-dimensional (0D) single-site catalysts, thereby reducing the risk of overoxidation. Additionally, the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site enhances the selectivity towards olefin products. The synergistic effects of these surface and gas-phase reactions optimize catalyst performance by balancing reactivity and selectivity, leading to improved olefin yields and stability during the reaction.

The implications of these synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization include the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction. By understanding the specific roles of the active sites and the mechanisms governing the reaction pathways, researchers can tailor catalyst designs to maximize olefin selectivity and minimize unwanted byproducts. This knowledge also facilitates the prediction and control of reaction outcomes, enabling the fine-tuning of operating conditions for optimal yield and efficiency. Furthermore, the insights gained from this study can inform the design of catalysts for other oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, potentially expanding the scope of sustainable chemical synthesis processes.

多维性质的ODHP反应机制，跨越B基催化剂的表面和气相自由基反应，对我们理解整体反应网络做出了贡献，通过阐明参与过程的各种成分的具体作用和相互作用。氧终止的臂链BN边缘作为反应活性位点，允许从丙烷中高效地提取氢原子，导致B-OH物种和亚硝基自由基的形成。这种一维（1D）结构避免了零维（0D）单个催化剂位点通常形成的高度反应性的丙基自由基，从而减少了过氧化的风险。此外，丙基自由基通过亚硝基自由基位点的稳定提高了烯烃产物的选择性。

这些表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的含义包括开发更高效和选择性更好的催化剂用于ODHP反应。通过理解活性位点的具体作用和反应途径的机制，研究人员可以调整催化剂设计以最大化烯烃选择性和最小化副产品的生成。这也有助于预测和控制反应结果，使操作条件的微调成为可能，以实现最佳的产率和效率。此外，从这项研究中获得的知识可以指导催化剂的设计，适用于其他氧化脱氢反应，有可能扩展可持续化学合成过程的范围。

[1] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B). When the supported vanadia catalyst is used, the main by-products are COx, which account for 33% of total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion. Conversely, when BN materials are used, the main by-product is ethene, a highly valuable olefin itself, rather than COx."
[2] "The high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology (15, 21)."
[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."
[4] "The proposed intermediate structures and energies of the overall catalytic cycle are included in fig. S11. We envision that a second abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a primary carbon follows another radical rebound, and creates a di-propoxyl intermediate. Desorption of propene and the reorganization of hydrogen atoms along the edge form water as a side product."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This synergy contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The surface reactions facilitated by the one-dimensional (1D) oxygen-terminated armchair BN edges prevent the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of zero-dimensional (0D) single-site catalysts. Moreover, the stabilization of adsorbed species by the nitroxyl radical site suppresses overoxidation, a common issue in two-dimensional (2D) surface catalysts. The implication for catalyst performance and design optimization lies in achieving high olefin selectivity through a finely balanced interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase reactivity, leading to enhanced efficiency and reduced waste production.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these mechanisms implies that catalyst performance can be optimized by balancing surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions. The implications for catalyst design include tailoring the catalyst structure to enhance the stability and reactivity of intermediates, thereby improving selectivity and efficiency. The stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites on the oxygen-terminated armchair BN edge is a key factor in achieving high olefin selectivity. The process of abstraction and subsequent radical rebound leads to the formation of di-propoxyl intermediates, which eventually desorb as propene, with the regeneration of the active site through the desorption of water and the reorganization of hydrogen atoms. This exothermic process facilitates efficient water desorption and oxygen addition, ensuring continuous catalyst functionality.

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism on boron nitride (BN) catalysts contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This integration of mechanisms enhances catalyst performance through synergistic effects that optimize reaction pathways and product selectivity. Specifically, the proposed active site, an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (denoted as >BOON<), facilitates the reaction by acting as an effective catalyst for the ODHP process. The stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site is crucial for achieving high olefin selectivity. The one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge structure avoids the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of 0D catalysts and suppresses overoxidation usually associated with 2D surface catalysts. These synergistic effects, as demonstrated through the proposed radical rebound mechanism and confirmed by computational studies, highlight the unique catalytic properties of BN-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism contrasts sharply with traditional single-site catalysts (0D, e.g., V/SiO2) and surface catalysts (2D, e.g., Cu(111)), which tend to create reactive propyl radicals or allow unrestricted diffusion of adsorbates, leading to overoxidation. By avoiding the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppressing overoxidation of adsorbed species, the proposed one-dimensional (1D) active site ensures better control over the reaction pathway, resulting in high olefin selectivity. This understanding has implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, potentially enabling more efficient and selective synthesis of propene from propane through oxidative dehydrogenation.

多维的ODHP反应机制在硼基催化剂上，结合表面和气相自由基反应，极大地丰富了我们对整体反应网络的理解。与传统的单个催化点（0D，如V/SiO2）和表面催化剂（2D，如Cu(111)表面）相比，这些传统催化剂倾向于生成活性丙基自由基或允许吸附物的无限制扩散，从而导致过氧化。通过避免形成高度活性的丙基自由基并抑制吸附物种的过氧化，所提出的单维（1D）活性位点确保了对反应路径更好的控制，从而实现了高烯烃选择性。这一理解对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义，可能使从丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢合成更加高效和选择性。
