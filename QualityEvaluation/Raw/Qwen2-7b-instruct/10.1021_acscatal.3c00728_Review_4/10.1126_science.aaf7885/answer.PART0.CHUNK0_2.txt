[1] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction."
[2] "Indeed, BN samples from various suppliers and containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[3] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[5] "We envision that a second abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a primary carbon follows another radical rebound, and creates a di-propoxyl intermediate."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these mechanisms implies that catalyst performance can be optimized by balancing surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions. The implications for catalyst design include tailoring the catalyst structure to enhance the stability and reactivity of intermediates, thereby improving selectivity and efficiency. The stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites on the oxygen-terminated armchair BN edge is a key factor in achieving high olefin selectivity. The process of abstraction and subsequent radical rebound leads to the formation of di-propoxyl intermediates, which eventually desorb as propene, with the regeneration of the active site through the desorption of water and the reorganization of hydrogen atoms. This exothermic process facilitates efficient water desorption and oxygen addition, ensuring continuous catalyst functionality.

多维性质的ODHP反应机制，包括催化剂表面和气相自由基反应，为全面理解整个反应网络提供了见解。这些机制之间的协同作用意味着可以通过平衡表面化学和气相相互作用来优化催化剂性能。设计催化剂时的启示包括调整催化剂结构以增强中间体的稳定性和活性，从而提高选择性和效率。氧终止的臂状BN边缘上的硝基自由基位点对丙基自由基的稳定是实现高烯烃选择性的关键因素。从抽象过程开始，随后的自由基反弹导致形成二丙氧基中间体，最终作为丙烯脱附。通过水的脱附和氢原子的重组，水分子被连续地再生，同时进行氧添加，确保催化剂的持续功能。
