[1] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
[2] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[4] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."
[5] "The proposed intermediate structures and energies of the overall catalytic cycle are included in fig. S11."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism on boron nitride (BN) catalysts contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This integration of mechanisms enhances catalyst performance through synergistic effects that optimize reaction pathways and product selectivity. Specifically, the proposed active site, an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (denoted as >BOON<), facilitates the reaction by acting as an effective catalyst for the ODHP process. The stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site is crucial for achieving high olefin selectivity. The one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge structure avoids the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of 0D catalysts and suppresses overoxidation usually associated with 2D surface catalysts. These synergistic effects, as demonstrated through the proposed radical rebound mechanism and confirmed by computational studies, highlight the unique catalytic properties of BN-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

多维性质的氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应机制在硼氮（BN）催化剂上的应用，有助于我们理解整体反应网络。这种机制的整合不仅包括表面和气相自由基反应，而且通过优化反应途径和产物选择性，增强了催化剂性能。具体来说，所提出的活性位点，即BN的氧终止的臂链边缘（表示为>BOON<），通过充当ODHP过程的有效催化剂，促进了反应。通过稳定丙基自由基的硝基自由基位点，实现了高烯烃选择性。这种单维（1D）结构的边缘特性避免了形成典型的0D催化剂中高度反应性的丙基自由基，并抑制了通常与2D表面催化剂相关的过氧化作用。这些协同效应，通过提出自由基反弹机制并得到计算研究证实，突出了BN基催化剂的唯一催化特性。
