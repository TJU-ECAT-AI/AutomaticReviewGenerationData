The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions highlight the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, indicating that the efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by both the surface properties of the catalyst and the behavior of radicals in the gas phase. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. For instance, the highest propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates were achieved with specific chromium oxide/silica catalysts, suggesting that optimizing the structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface could lead to more efficient catalysts. By correlating the catalytic properties with the state of chromium, researchers can gain insights into how to tailor catalysts for optimal performance in the ODHP reaction.

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism highlights the importance of synergistic effects between the surface reactions on the catalyst and the gas-phase reactions. The high propylene selectivity (95%) observed with the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample and the high propane conversion (53%) achieved with the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts. These findings imply that optimizing the structure and composition of the catalysts can lead to enhanced performance in terms of selectivity and conversion rates, which is crucial for improving the efficiency of the ODHP process.

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions work synergistically, enhancing the efficiency of the process. This synergy affects the catalyst's performance and allows for optimized design, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates. The study specifically found that a 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, prepared from Degussa silica, showed the highest propylene selectivity (95%), while another 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, made from Acros silica, demonstrated the highest propane conversion (53%). The UVVis spectroscopy study of the chromium oxide particles' structure further elucidates how the state of chromium impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity, providing insights for future catalyst development.
