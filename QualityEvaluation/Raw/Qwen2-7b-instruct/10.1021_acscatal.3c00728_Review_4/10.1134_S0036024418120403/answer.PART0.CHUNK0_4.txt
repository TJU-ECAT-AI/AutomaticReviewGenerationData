The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions work synergistically, enhancing the efficiency of the process. This synergy affects the catalyst's performance and allows for optimized design, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates. The study specifically found that a 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, prepared from Degussa silica, showed the highest propylene selectivity (95%), while another 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, made from Acros silica, demonstrated the highest propane conversion (53%). The UVVis spectroscopy study of the chromium oxide particles' structure further elucidates how the state of chromium impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity, providing insights for future catalyst development.

氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应机制在B基催化剂上的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，极大地促进了我们对整体反应网络的理解。这些反应的协同作用提高了过程的效率。这种协同作用影响催化剂性能，并允许优化设计，从而提高选择性和转化率。研究发现，使用Degussa硅酸盐制备的5% CrOx/SiO2催化剂显示出最高的丙烯选择性（95%），而使用Acros硅酸盐制备的另一种5% CrOx/SiO2催化剂则表现出最高的丙烷转化率（53%）。对铬氧化物颗粒结构的UVVis光谱研究进一步揭示了铬的状态如何影响催化剂的活性和选择性，为未来的催化剂开发提供了见解。
