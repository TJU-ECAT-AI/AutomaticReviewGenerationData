[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism highlights the importance of synergistic effects between the surface reactions on the catalyst and the gas-phase reactions. The high propylene selectivity (95%) observed with the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample and the high propane conversion (53%) achieved with the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts. These findings imply that optimizing the structure and composition of the catalysts can lead to enhanced performance in terms of selectivity and conversion rates, which is crucial for improving the efficiency of the ODHP process.
