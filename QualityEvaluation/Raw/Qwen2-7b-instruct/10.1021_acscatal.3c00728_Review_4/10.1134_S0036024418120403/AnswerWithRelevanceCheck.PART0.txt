          [1] "A systematic analysis was performed of the physicochemical properties of amorphous silicas (Acros, Degussa, KSKG) and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared from them with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 wt % chromium."
          [2] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst."
          [3] "The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface was studied by UVVis spectroscopy."
          [4] "The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium."

          The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions highlight the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, indicating that the efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by both the surface properties of the catalyst and the behavior of radicals in the gas phase. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. For instance, the highest propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates were achieved with specific chromium oxide/silica catalysts, suggesting that optimizing the structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface could lead to more efficient catalysts. By correlating the catalytic properties with the state of chromium, researchers can gain insights into how to tailor catalysts for optimal performance in the ODHP reaction.
