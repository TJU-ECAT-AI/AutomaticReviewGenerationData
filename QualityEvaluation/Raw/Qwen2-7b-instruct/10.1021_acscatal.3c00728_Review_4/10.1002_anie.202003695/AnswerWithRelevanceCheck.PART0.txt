          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, including both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface-initiated reactions and gas-phase radical propagation. This synergy explains the high selectivity of the process, particularly in forming propylene over ethylene, and provides insights into catalyst performance and design optimization. The implications of these synergistic effects are significant for catalyst performance and design optimization, enabling the efficient conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity. By integrating surface and gas-phase chemistry, researchers can tailor catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the ODHP, focusing on generating reactive species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane. This approach minimizes fast consecutive surface oxidation steps and promotes the formation of desired propyl radicals, leading to improved product distribution and selectivity.

          [2] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
          [4] "In contrast, the well-studied vanadium-based catalysts are assumed to primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface."
          [5] "These conclusions are in line with studies by Iglesia etal. exploring .OH-mediated oxidation of methane,34 and Deshlahra etal. investigating NOx-mediated ODH reactions;35 moreover, they reveal a general set of guidelines with which to pursue development of more selective catalysts."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface-initiated reactions and gas-phase radical propagation. This synergy is crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization, as it allows for the efficient conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity. The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they enable the development of more selective catalysts that can efficiently balance surface reactions with gas-phase chemistry, leading to improved product distributions and yield. The findings align with previous studies on OH-mediated oxidation of methane and NOx-mediated ODH reactions, suggesting a general set of guidelines for developing more selective catalysts that can effectively utilize both surface and gas-phase reactions to optimize the ODHP process.

          The addition of water to the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts enhances the rates of existing pathways, indicating its potential role in facilitating the formation of intermediates that react in the gas phase. This finding suggests that water might play a significant role in the reaction network by participating in the formation of reactive intermediates. In the context of B6O3#2, it emerges as a promising candidate for its capability to chemisorb and activate O2 into stable BO. radicals, which can abstract a hydrogen atom from propane, as well as activate water into BH, a species that can react with O2 to form a free HOO. radical. Our proposed reaction mechanism underscores the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry and surface-mediated reactions in understanding and optimizing catalyst performance, highlighting the synergistic effects that contribute to the efficiency of the ODHP process and the formation of desired products.
