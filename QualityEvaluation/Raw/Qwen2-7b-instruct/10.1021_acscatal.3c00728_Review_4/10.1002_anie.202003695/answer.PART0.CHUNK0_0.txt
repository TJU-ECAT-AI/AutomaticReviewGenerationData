How does the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contribute to our understanding of the overall reaction network, and what are the implications of their synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization?

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding is achieved through the synergy between surface-mediated radical formation and their propagation in the gas phase. The surface initiates the free-radical gas-phase reaction, offering a unique mechanism compared to vanadium-based catalysts, which predominantly operate via a Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism with oxidized vanadium species activating propane at the surface. The implications of this synergy are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. By generating reactive species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane and minimizing interactions with intermediates and products, catalysts can be designed to maintain high selectivity even at high propane conversions. This approach highlights the importance of optimizing the void space in a catalyst bed and developing catalysts capable of generating HOO radicals rather than alkyl radicals, which can further enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process.

氧化脱氢化反应机制在硼基催化剂中的多维特性，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，对我们理解整个反应网络做出了重大贡献。这种理解通过表面介导的自由基形成及其在气相中的传播来实现。表面启动了气相自由基反应，提供了一种与以氧化钒基催化剂为主的马尔斯-范克雷伦机制截然不同的独特机制。这一协同作用对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。通过生成有利于丙烷中次级CH键抽象的活性物种，并最小化与中间体和产物的相互作用，可以设计出即使在高丙烷转化率下也能保持高选择性的催化剂。这种方法强调了优化催化剂床孔隙空间以及开发能够生成HOO基团而不是烷基基团的催化剂的重要性，这将进一步提高氧化脱氢化过程的效率和选择性。
