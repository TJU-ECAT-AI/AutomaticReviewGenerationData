[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
[3] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
[4] "In contrast, the well-studied vanadium-based catalysts are assumed to primarily activate the CH bond of propane at the surface."
[5] "These conclusions are in line with studies by Iglesia etal. exploring .OH-mediated oxidation of methane,34 and Deshlahra etal. investigating NOx-mediated ODH reactions;35 moreover, they reveal a general set of guidelines with which to pursue development of more selective catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the synergistic effects between these two components. This synergy is critical for catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the surface of B-based catalysts plays a crucial role in generating reactive species like HOO. radicals, which activate propane in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation. This contrasts with vanadium-based catalysts, where the activation of propane occurs primarily at the surface, followed by homolytic activation and consecutive surface oxidation steps. The findings align with previous studies on OH-mediated oxidation of methane and NOx-mediated ODH reactions, suggesting a general set of guidelines for developing more selective catalysts that efficiently utilize both surface and gas-phase reactions to optimize the ODHP process.

多维的ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上的应用，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，有助于我们理解整个反应网络，通过揭示这两部分之间的协同作用。这种协同作用对于催化剂性能和设计优化至关重要。具体而言，B基催化剂的表面在生成活性物种（如HOO.自由基）中起着关键作用，这些物种在气相中激活丙烷，从而导致快速自由基传播。这与以表面为主进行丙烷活化的范德华催化剂形成了鲜明对比，在后者中，表面氧化步骤迅速且非决定性。这些发现与伊格莱亚等人的甲烷氧化研究以及德沙赫拉等人的NOx介导的ODHP反应研究一致，为开发更选择性的催化剂提供了一套通用指南，这些催化剂能够有效地利用表面和气相反应来优化ODHP过程。
