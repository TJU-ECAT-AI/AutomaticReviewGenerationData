[1] "The addition of water enhances the rates of pathways already present under standard conditions."
[2] "During water cofeeding, N2 flow rates were adjusted to obtain 10% H2O concentration."
[3] "The observed increase in reactivity upon addition of steam indicates that water may be involved in formation of intermediates that react in the gas phase."
[4] "We find that all of them can contribute to the whole map of catalysis to some extent. B6O3#2 stands out as the candidate that can chemisorb and activate O2 into stable BO. to abstract a H atom from propane, as well as activate water into BH that can react with O2 to form a free HOO. radical."
[5] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."

1. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding by revealing the complex interplay between surface-initiated radical reactions and gas-phase chemistry. This synergy explains the high selectivity of the process, particularly in forming propylene over ethylene, and provides insights into the catalyst performance and design optimization.

2. The implications of their synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. By integrating surface and gas-phase chemistry, researchers can tailor catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the ODHP, focusing on generating reactive species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane. This approach minimizes fast consecutive surface oxidation steps and promotes the formation of desired propyl radicals, leading to improved product distribution and selectivity.

3. The complexity of the oxidation process over B-based catalysts, as highlighted by the computational studies, underscores the importance of considering various boron species with different reactivities. This understanding can guide the development of more selective catalysts that optimize the void space in a catalyst bed and favor the formation of propylene over ethylene, potentially through the strategic design of catalyst surfaces and pore structures.

1. B催化剂上的多维反应机制，包括表面和气相自由基反应，通过揭示表面启动的自由基反应与气相化学之间的复杂相互作用，加深了我们对整个反应网络的理解。这种协同作用解释了过程的高度选择性，尤其是形成丙烯而不是乙烯，并为催化剂性能和设计优化提供了见解。

2. 这些协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响至关重要。通过整合表面和气相化学，研究人员可以调整催化剂以提高ODHP的效率，重点关注生成有利于丙烷中次级CH键抽象的活性物种。这种方法减少了快速连续表面氧化步骤，促进了所需丙基自由基的形成，从而提高了产物分布和选择性。

3. 计算研究中强调的B催化剂上氧化过程的复杂性突出了考虑各种具有不同反应性的硼物种的重要性。这种理解可以指导开发更选择性的催化剂，优化催化剂床中的空隙空间，并优先形成丙烯而非乙烷，可能通过战略性设计催化剂表面和孔结构。
