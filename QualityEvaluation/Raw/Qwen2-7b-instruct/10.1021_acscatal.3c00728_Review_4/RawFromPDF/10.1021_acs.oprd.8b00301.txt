Abstract
In this contribution, we investigate the effect of various reactor parameters on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterogeneous catalyst. The analysis begins with an assessment of the influence of mass and heat transport on the observed ODH activity. Unexpected experimental results during this analysis prompted us to investigate the use of SiC as an inert catalyst diluent, and we found an increase in propane conversion with increasing diluent content in the reactor. Control experiments suggested that SiC itself is catalytically inactive and that there may be a significant influence of gas-phase chemistry on the observed reactivity.

Introduction
The increased availability of natural gas resources—particularly in the United States—has led to a shift in the feedstocks of the petrochemical value chain. Some steam cracking units have been retrofitted to use lighter ethane instead of petroleum-derived naphtha, lowering the production cost of ethylene at the expense of propylene and other longer-chain olefins. (1) These olefins are important building blocks in the production of polymers and specialty chemicals, and therefore, processes for their sustainable production from natural gas feedstocks are needed.
Current on-purpose technologies for the production of propylene and butenes are based on nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation, such as the Oleflex (UOP), Catofin (Lummus), and STAR (Uhde) processes. (2) While very selective, these technologies require significant capital investment because of the complex catalyst regeneration schemes needed to mitigate catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition. Moreover, the endothermic nature of the chemistry makes these processes very energy-intensive. In response, oxidative routes have been proposed as advantageous alternatives that avoid coke formation and allow lower reaction temperatures because of the exothermic nature of the reaction. Thus, the direct conversion of light alkanes to olefins via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is a well-studied challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. (3) While a significant body of knowledge has been produced as a result of the research on the mechanism of ODH of light alkanes (mainly propane), no metal oxide catalyst system has been deemed feasible for commercial scale-up. The main obstacle for economic viability lies in the significant overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides (CO and CO2) at industrially relevant conversion levels. (4)
We recently proposed hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as an alternative to traditional propane ODH catalysts. (5) Boron nitride offers improved propylene selectivity compared with vanadium-based or alkaline-earth oxide catalysts. Its novelty, however, lies primarily in its product distribution, with the main secondary product being ethylene rather than the carbon oxides typically observed with metal oxide systems. (6,7) We also reported that hBN is an active and selective catalyst for ODH of n-butane and isobutane, (8) while Shi et al. (9) showed that hBN is also a highly selective catalyst for ODH of ethane. These reports established hBN as a catalyst of interest for ODH of light alkanes. Since then, other groups have attempted to influence its reactivity by chemical (10−12) or mechanical treatment, (13) reporting a variety of reaction rates, activation energies, and product distributions. While these discrepancies may indeed be the result of differences in the material properties of the tested catalysts, (6) it is important to ensure comparable reaction conditions for future catalyst development and optimization.
As an example of the important differences in experimental design reported to date, Table 1 shows some of the various feed compositions and reactor temperatures used in hBN-catalyzed ODH as reported in the literature to date. We reported that the oxidant partial pressure has an important effect on the product selectivity, (8) and thus, a comparison of product selectivities may be influenced by the feed composition. Additionally, the reported pretreatment conditions (e.g., oxidation under air, conditioning under a reaction feed) vary as well. Zhou et al. (14) reported that an induction period of hBN during ODH of ethane changes the reactivity properties of the material under steady state. Thus, consistent catalyst conditioning is key for accurate comparison of boron-containing materials.

Finally, heat transport considerations have received only limited attention when hBN is used as an ODH catalyst. Tian et al. (15) reported a comparison between the use of undiluted V/Al2O3 and hBN for ODH of propane. As expected from the high (bulk) thermal conductivity of hBN (33 W K–1 m–1), (15) the authors found lower temperature gradients when an undiluted hBN catalyst bed was used. Several authors have reported the dilution of hBN materials in quartz sand (12−14) to prevent hotspot formation, but the thermal conductivity of quartz (1–2 W K–1 m–1) (16) is far lower than that of hBN, which may lead to hotspot formation if too little diluent is used. Excessive dilution, however, may lead to sample inhomogeneity (17) and with it artifacts in the observed reactivity of hBN.
In this contribution, we explore the importance of the catalyst bed configuration, with a specific focus on the role of the reactor bed diluent during the hBN-catalyzed ODH of propane. We find that the level of inert dilution and the bed packing have important effects on the observed reactivity of hBN. Beyond providing insight for other researchers in the field, these observations also give us glimpses into the complex ODH mechanism. We must emphasize, however, that we chose hBN as a catalyst in this work because of our past experiences with the material but expect that the observed catalysis is not unique to it. As we previously reported, (18) other boron-containing materials such as elemental B, NiB, and B4C, show performance comparable to that of hBN, and the lessons learned in this contribution may prove useful for research on this broader class of oxidation catalysts.
Results
Criteria for Estimating the Effects of Transport Phenomena on the Reaction Rate
In analyzing the effects of reactor parameters on the performance of hBN, we first estimated the possible influence of transport phenomena on the observed reactivity. The applied analytical criteria have been extensively documented. (19−22) In the following sections, we present our analysis of our “base case” scenario, using 100 mg of undiluted hBN (425–600 μm particle size) and an 8 mm i.d. reactor with a feed composition of C3H8:O2:N2 = 1:0.5:1.83 and a feed flow rate of 40 mLSTP/min. As this is the lowest flow rate in a typical testing regime, we expect that if criteria are met under these conditions, they will be met at higher flow rates (and ensuing lower conversions).
Several useful tools to estimate transport criteria are available to the catalysis community. In particular, GradientCheck (23) and the Eurokin fixed-bed web tool (24) are valuable for estimating the role of transport phenomena in an efficient way during preliminary testing. We explicitly carried out these calculations using the quantities that could be controlled or measured in our current reactor configuration. We begin by exploring the flow pattern in our planned reactor configuration.
Criteria for Plug Flow Operation
To ensure that the plug flow regime in the reactor is maintained, the works of Mears (19) and Gierman (25) establish a minimum bed length that minimizes axial dispersion (eq 1):
(1)
where Bo is the Bodenstein number.
In addition to this axial dispersion criterion, wall effects, where the concentration of catalyst is influenced by the presence of an inert wall, must be taken into account. This consideration leads to the classical rule of thumb for the ratio of the tube inner diameter to the particle diameter (eq 2): (21)
(2)
This criterion is met in the most conservative of cases, where dp is taken to be the upper limit of 600 μm and dt/dp = 13.3.
We calculated the Bodenstein number for our base case scenario on the basis of correlations presented by Wakao et al. (26) (see Tables S1.1–S1.4 and section S2 for the calculations) and obtained the value Bo = 0.32. Figure 1 compares the result using eq 1 for our Bo to our experimental Lb/dp ratio. Our conservative experimental ratio of 5 (3 mm bed height, 600 μm particle diameter) exceeds the criterion of eq 1 in our tested conversion regime and only first fails at a propane conversion of 18%, which is above our experimentally observed conversions where reaction rates were measured. Thus, we estimate that the reactor approximates the plug flow contacting pattern during catalytic testing at our moderate conversions below 20%.

Criterion for External Mass Transfer Limitations
To assess the effect of propane concentration gradients across the boundary layer between the bulk fluid and a catalyst particle, Kapteijn and Moulijn suggest the use of the Carberry number (Ca). (21) This dimensionless parameter compares the observed reaction rate with the maximum rate possible, assuming no gradients. If we take a maximum 5% deviation from the maximum rate, eq 3 is
(3)
where kf is the film mass transfer coefficient and av is the specific surface area of the pellet. We assumed that the pellet approximates a sphere, and thus, av = 6/dp. The film transfer coefficient was approximated using correlations presented by Wakao and Funazkri (27) as detailed in section S3. From this analysis, we find Ca = 6.1 × 10–4, so external reactant gradients likely do not influence the observed reaction rate.
Criterion for Internal Mass Transfer Limitations
As described by Froment and Bischoff, (28) the analytical estimation of intraparticle concentration gradients is based on the Weisz–Prater criterion (eq 4):
(4)
If the pellets are approximated as spheres, then the characteristic length L is given by the volume/surface area ratio, which is equal to dp/6. Furthermore, if we assume that in this test only internal diffusion is limiting, then the surface concentration of propane is equal to the bulk gas concentration. The calculations used to estimate the effective diffusivity (De,A) of propane are shown in section S4. Using eq 4, we estimate that in the base case scenario, Φ = 0.004, and therefore, internal diffusion resistances minimally influence the observed reaction rate. The sensitivity of this calculation to the assumed catalyst properties (tortuosity and porosity) is detailed in section S7.
Criterion for External Heat Transfer Limitations
Kapteijn and Moulijn described the criterion used to determine whether the observed reaction rate deviates more than 5% from the artifact-free rate as a result of temperature gradients between the catalyst and the bulk fluid (eq 5): (21)
(5)
In this scenario, we approximated the heat generated as the enthalpy of reaction for the aerobic oxidation of propane to propylene (eq 6): (15)
(6)
Additionally, we used an approximate activation energy of 220 kJ mol–1 on the basis of the various reports on ODH of propane shown in Table 1. Once again, we approximated the film heat transfer coefficient using the correlations reported by Wakao et al. (26) as described in section S5. The resulting inequality is 0.25 K < 1.13 K, suggesting that there is a minimal temperature gradient surrounding the catalyst surface under ODH conditions.
Criterion for Internal Heat Transfer Limitations
Analogously to the external heat transport case, Mears (22) established a criterion for isothermicity within a catalyst pellet (eq 7), again establishing a maximum deviation of 5%:
(7)
where λp is the thermal conductivity of the particle, which for hBN is estimated to be 33 W m–1 K–1 as used by Tian et al. (15) Using the same parameters as in eq 5, we obtain an inequality of 2.2 × 10–4 K < 1.13 K, indicating that particle temperature gradients have an even weaker influence on the observed reactivity than film gradients do.
Radial Heat Transfer Limitations
Lab-scale reactors tend to suffer from issues of radial heat transfer, particularly at high temperatures, because of inefficient heat transfer from the reactor tube wall to the catalyst particles. (20) Mears further developed heat transfer criteria to gauge the isothermicity at a cross section of the reactor tube (eq 8):
(8)
(19,21,22) This criterion has the added complexities of estimating the effective radial thermal conductivity of the bed (λeff) and the wall Biot number (Biw = hwdt/λeff). Once again, the estimation of the wall heat transfer coefficient (hw) and λeff were done using correlations, as detailed in section S6. The resulting inequality obtained from eq 8 is 0.88 K < 1.13 K. This result suggests that radial temperature gradients are within the tolerance range, albeit closer to failing than the other heat transfer analytical criteria discussed.
Experimental Checks for Transport Limitations
Beyond analytical estimates to determine the effects of heat and mass transfer on the performance of undiluted hBN during ODH of propane, we carried out additional experiments to gauge the importance of intra- and interparticle gradients.
In the first experiment, hBN was pelletized and crushed to three different particle size ranges: 212–300, 425–600, and 710–850 μm. For each range, a 100 mg sample of pellets was tested at the same WBN/Fo and temperature. Figure 2 shows the resulting reaction rate for each particle size range. The approximately constant reaction rate with pellet sizes of 212–600 μm indicates that intraparticle gradients play a minimal role in the observed catalytic activity. For subsequent work, we used the 425–600 μm particle size range.

To gauge the effect of external mass transfer on the observed reactivity, varying masses of hBN (i.e., 50, 100, and 260 mg) were tested under identical conditions, with WBN/Fo held constant by adjustment of the total gas flow. Figure 3 shows that under the tested conditions there is a noticeable difference in reactivity as a function of catalyst mass and flow rate. As the external mass transfer coefficient is proportional to the flow velocity, (21,29) we expect tests with higher masses of catalyst to be less influenced by boundary layer gradients. In turn, these tests would be expected to show higher alkane conversions, but we observe the exact opposite trend. Assuming that this phenomenon was indeed linked to external gradients, we carried out one test using a reactor with a smaller inner diameter (4 mm vs 8 mm), as decreasing the reactor diameter has been shown to be an effective way of minimizing transport effects on observed reaction rates. (19,20)

After the sample was conditioned and cooled to a reaction temperature of 500 °C, we did not observe any significant reactivity in the same WBN/Fo range of 3–12 kgBN s molC3H8−1 as used in Figures 2 and 3. In turn, we increased the reaction temperature to 525 °C and WBN/Fo to 16–25 kgBN s molC3H8−1. Figure 4 shows that even under these new conditions, hBN showed noticeably lower reactivity compared with the experiments with an 8 mm i.d. tube. Intuitively, however, we expected the lower-diameter reactor to show improved performance because of the higher gas velocity at a given WBN/Fo. The unexpected reactivity trends found in these experiments led us to explore more complex gas–solid interactions that may lead to the observed reactivity, such as simultaneous heat transfer effects. (29) We explored this possibility by the addition of diluents to the catalyst bed.

Catalyst Diluent Effects
Role of the Diluent Material
The unexpected catalytic performance with varying catalyst mass makes bed dilution a reasonable next step to further investigate the effect of reactor parameters on boron-based ODH processes. We tested one of the most common diluents used in ODH, β-SiC, because of its high thermal conductivity and inertness (after passivation as described in the Experimental Section). Because of the important change in reactivity observed with varying catalyst mass, first the hBN mass was held constant at 100 mg while the amount of diluent in the catalyst bed was varied. The total bed height increases with higher amounts of diluent (details of the bed dimensions are found in Table S2).
Figure 5 shows the conversion–selectivity trends for various levels of SiC diluent. When hBN is diluted with SiC, we see a decrease in propylene selectivity of approximately 5% and a concomitant increase in cracking products (ethylene and CO) at a given conversion value. We do not observe a significant change in the selectivities toward CO2, CH4, or C4 compounds. Blank experiments at the same space velocities with only SiC showed less than 1% propane conversion at 550 °C and approximately 0.3% conversion at 500 °C. Therefore, this decrease in propylene selectivity may be caused by the interaction of SiC with a long-lived reaction intermediate that is formed during hBN-catalyzed ODH. Additionally, the propylene selectivity does not decrease further with increasing amounts of SiC in the catalyst bed. Despite this small loss in selectivity, the presence of SiC in the catalyst bed noticeably improves the achieved propane conversion within the tested WBN/Fo range.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Carbon selectivity as a function of propane conversion at various levels of SiC dilution. The total mass of hBN was held constant at 100 mg.
At WBN/Fo ≈ 12 kgBN s molC3H8−1, we see propane conversions of 3.7% with undiluted hBN and 19% at Vdiluent/Vtotal = 0.87. This 5-fold increase in reactivity is particularly unexpected in the case of an exothermic reaction such as ODH, where dilution with a thermal conductor such as SiC would decrease the heat generated per unit volume of catalyst bed. In turn, if heat effects were playing a significant role in the observed reaction, we would expect decreased reactivity with increasing dilution. (19−22) The opposite trend is shown in Figure 6, where the measured alkane consumption rate increases with higher fractions of SiC diluent in a nonlinear trend.

The blue symbol indicates a layered bed configuration with hBN layered over a bed of SiC. The total mass of hBN was held constant at 100 mg.
Effect of the Bed Configuration
We hypothesized that at least in part the role of SiC must be chemical in nature, reacting with intermediates or products of ODH. In particular, the influence of propylene oxidation on the observed reactivity could be significant under the tested conditions. Orzesek et al. (30) observed uncatalyzed propylene oxidation starting at temperatures as low as 260 °C at elevated pressures. Control experiments with 750 mg of SiC in the reactor bed and using propylene as the reactant (flow rate = 40 mL/min; 30% C3H6, 15% O2, balance N2) showed less than 0.3% conversion at 500 °C, suggesting that SiC does not oxidize propylene at ambient pressures. Nevertheless, other intermediates, such as alkyl species, may be involved. As a test of this hypothesis, we used the same absolute quantities of hBN and SiC equivalent to a diluent fraction of 0.87 (100 mg of BN, 750 mg of SiC) and layered them rather than homogeneously mixing them. In this scenario, the hBN was placed above the SiC bed, and therefore, if the intermediates formed by hBN react with SiC, we would expect to see reactivity comparable to that for the fully mixed bed. Figure 6 shows that the measured reaction rate of this experiment is over 4 times lower than in the homogeneously mixed case. This experiment suggests that any reactive intermediates that could interact with SiC are not long-lived enough to be found downstream of the hBN bed. The small increase in reaction rate compared with the undiluted hBN scenario may occur because the interface between the bed layers approximates the homogeneously mixed case.
Since these experiments were carried out with a constant mass of hBN (∼100 mg), the difference in reactivity does not appear to scale with WBN/Fo (Figure S1). Instead, the overall catalyst bed dimensions directly affect the reactivity, with larger total bed volumes increasing the observed ODH activity. Indeed, Figure 7 shows a linear relationship between the conversion and the propane residence time in the entire bed volume, suggesting that the overall time spent in the reactive portion of the reactor is a better descriptor of the activity than the catalyst mass. This result compelled us to explore the possibility that gas-phase reactions play a significant role in the observed ODH activity.

Exploration of the Role of Gas-Phase Chemistry
We postulate that the separation of the hBN pellets and the increase in the interparticle space due to the presence of SiC are needed for high reactivity of boron-based catalysts, and this is the case because of a mixed heterogeneous–homogeneous ODH mechanism. In this scenario, we speculate that the BOx sites formed on the hBN surface (18) act as “initiators”, generating propyl radicals upon H abstraction from propane. Once in the gas phase, propyl radicals can decompose to reaction products or interact with oxygen to form hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radicals. These radical reactions form chain carriers in the gas phase that can further activate propane molecules.
We emphasize that radical-mediated selective oxidation mechanisms have been previously proposed in the literature. The group of Marin extensively studied the reaction kinetics of oxidative methane coupling (OCM) in empty reactors (31) and using Li/MgO catalysts, (32) and they proposed an overall mechanism coupling surface and gas-phase reactions. (33,34) Takanabe and co-workers proposed that hydroxyl radicals play an important role during OCM using Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts as well as during ODH of ethane. (35−38) Leveles et al. (39) developed a reaction kinetics study of Li/Dy/MgO catalysts for ODH of propane and identified reaction regimes where homogeneous reactions play a comparable role to surface-catalyzed propane conversion. Furthermore, their observed partial pressure dependencies show trends similar to those observed on hBN catalysts, (5,8,11) albeit with a significantly higher selectivity toward CO2. The catalysts used in those studies were primarily composed of nonreducible alkaline-earth metals, where the catalytic activity of lattice oxygen is unlikely to play a prevalent role. As such, these type of catalysts may show more parallels to hBN and other boron-based catalysts than reducible oxides such as vanadium or molybdenum oxides.
More recently, Shi et al. (9) carried out quantum-chemical calculations to propose a radical-based mechanism for the production of ethylene using oxygen-functionalized hBN. Within their mechanism, BNOH groups are proposed as surface species that are responsible for the catalytic activity. While refinement of their proposed active sites to account for the reactivity of various B-containing catalysts is warranted, the role of gas-phase chemistry may still be important. Thus, consideration of gas-phase species as significant contributors to ODH activity with hBN catalysts is compatible with a variety of frameworks presented in the literature for related partial oxidation systems.
Couwenberg et al. (34) proposed that in addition to initiating the OCM reaction, Li/MgO catalysts may also quench radicals. In their combined surface–gas microkinetic model, they calculated that 40% of chain termination events occur on the catalyst surface. By analogy to these materials, the improved reactivity of hBN at higher bed dilution ratios may be caused by the physical separation of hBN within the catalyst bed, thus minimizing its contribution to radical quenching. This hypothesis may explain the unexpected results shown in Figure 3, where decreasing the hBN mass improved the propane conversion at a given WBN/Fo. Increasing the mass of undiluted hBN leads to excessive quenching of radical species and an overall lower reactivity. We explored this possibility by testing varying amounts of hBN diluted with SiC to a constant bed volume of ∼0.9 cm3 (bed height of 1.8 cm). This volume was the bed volume obtained in our test using 100 mg of hBN and 500 mg of SiC.
Figure 8 shows a volcano-type dependence of the propane consumption rate on the mass of hBN in the reactor. At this total bed volume, the reactivity of hBN reaches a maximum at around 50–72 mg of catalyst. We did not study hBN masses lower than 25 mg because of the low flow rates that would have been required to achieve comparable WBN/Fo values. This volcano-like trend may indicate that the ratio of surface initiation events to chain termination events reaches a maximum. Lower hBN masses compromise the overall activation of propane by the BOx surface species, while higher catalyst masses lead to an excessive number of termination events as a result of the closer proximity among hBN pellets. At this point, it is unclear what additional parameters influence the relative importance of propane activation and chain termination surface steps, but we speculate that varying amounts of BOx surface densities among starting BN materials could lead to different optimal catalyst masses per unit reactor volume. Furthermore, these experiments were done under a single gas composition, and the extent of gas-phase chemistry contributions may be dictated by the reactant concentrations. (39) Therefore, the optimal catalyst bed configuration may vary with the boron material, reactor dimensions, and gas composition.

Summary and Conclusions
In this contribution, we aimed to study the influence of reactor design parameters on the observed reactivity of hBN. We have presented analytical estimates of the contributions of transport phenomena to the observed reactivity of undiluted hBN catalysts and compared these with experimental checks. While the analytical criteria predicted little contribution of transport limitations to the observed ODH performance, the experiments showed unexpected behavior when the catalyst mass was altered. Experiments exploring the role of SiC as a diluent to correct for these artifacts showed a significant reactivity increase with level of dilution that could not be explained by the inherent reactivity of SiC.
The observed catalytic activity of diluted hBN during ODH may be rooted in a surface-initiated reaction that proceeds in the gas phase via radical oxidation chemistry. This type of mechanism has been proposed for other nonreducible oxide catalysts for ODH and OCM and may involve significant radical quenching by hBN. The balance between surface radical formation and termination may lead to the observed optimal catalyst mass in our experimental regime. This study provides a step in further understanding the reaction mechanism of boron-catalyzed ODH, where gas-phase radical chemistry may be an important contributor to the high olefin selectivities observed with these materials. Furthermore, future studies of boron-based catalysts for ODH should identify the role of reactor parameters on the observed catalysis to ensure comparable catalytic data.
Experimental Section
Materials
hBN was purchased from Alfa Aesar (lot no. U12A027, 99.5% purity). β-SiC was purchased from Sicat (lot no. HP-D DA069B). The SiC materials were passivated by calcination for 12 h at 850 °C under a 40 mL/min air flow. This treatment forms a surface layer of SiOxCy that minimizes the reactivity of the material. (40) hBN powder was pressed into pellets in a 12 mm i.d. stainless steel die using a hydraulic press. All of the pellets were made with the following pressure program: 37 740 psi (3 tons of force) for 60 s, 62 900 psi (5 tons of force) for 60 s, and 88 061 psi (7 tons of force) for 60 s. The resulting pellets were crushed and sieved to the desired particle size range. N2 physisorption measurements indicated that the fresh pellets had a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 7 m2/g. Propane (instrument grade) was purchased from Matheson Trigas. Nitrogen (UHP grade) and oxygen (UHP grade) were purchased from Airgas.
ODH Catalytic Testing
All of the catalytic tests were performed in a Microactivity Effi microreactor (PID Eng & Tech). Typically, the desired masses of catalyst and diluent were loaded into a 12 mm o.d. × 8 mm i.d. quartz tube (Technical Glass Products) supported by a quartz wool plug (plug height = 1.5 cm) and a 1 cm tall quartz wool plug above the catalyst bed. The catalyst and diluent were homogeneously mixed by rotating the reactor tube and gently shaking. This process was continued until visual inspection of the bed indicated an even distribution of the catalyst throughout the diluent. The remaining reactor tube volume was filled with 0.5–1 mm quartz chips (Pyromatics) to minimize the contribution of gas-phase reactions outside the catalyst bed volume. A 1.59 mm o.d. K-type Inconel thermocouple was present in the center of the catalyst bed and was used to control the furnace temperature.
The reactor tube was loaded into a vertical split-tube furnace with a 20 cm heated length, and the catalyst bed was positioned in the center of the furnace. The furnace was located within a hot box heated to 160 °C in all of the experiments. The gas feed composition and flow rate were controlled by three mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst), and the gas feed was preheated by flowing through a coiled length of tube located within the hot box prior to entering the reactor tube in a top-down flow configuration. In all of the experiments, the pressure drop across the reactor length was less than 0.1 bar.
The water formed during ODH condensed outside the reactor hot box in a cold trap thermoelectrically cooled to −5 °C. A drain valve prevented excessive accumulation of liquid in the cold trap. The dried reactor effluent was analyzed via an online gas chromatograph (GC-2010+, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) in parallel analytical lines. CO, CO2, O2, and N2 were separated using RT-Q bond and RT-MSieve 5A columns (Restek) in series and quantified by TCD. Hydrocarbon products were separated by a GS-GasPro column (Agilent) and quantified by FID. All of the experiments presented in the text closed their carbon balance within ±3% using N2 as an internal standard.
All of the catalytic tests involved a lineout procedure, as Zhou et al. (14) reported the influence of an induction period on the reactivity of hBN during the ODH of ethane. First, the catalyst was heated to 550 °C under a 50:50 O2/N2 mixture at 40 mL/min. Upon temperature stabilization, the feed was changed to the reaction composition of 30% C3H8 and 15% O2 with N2 as the balance. The total feed flow rate was adjusted between 40 and 80 mL/min to prevent complete depletion of oxygen. The catalyst was treated under these conditions for at least 12 h and allowed to reach a steady state. Once catalyst conversion was stable, the gas feed was changed back to 50:50 O2/N2 at 40 mL/min, and the reactor was purged for 1 h. The temperature was then lowered to 500 °C, where the catalytic testing was carried out using the typical 30% C3H8/15% O2/55% N2 mixture. Experiments that deviated from these parameters are explicitly discussed in the text. Blank tests with a tube filled with only quartz chips or SiC showed conversions below 0.3% at 500 °C after the lineout procedure.
