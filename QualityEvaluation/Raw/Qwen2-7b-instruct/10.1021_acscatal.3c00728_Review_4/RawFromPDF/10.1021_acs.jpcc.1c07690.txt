Abstract
Metal-free boron-based catalytic systems are growing to be promising choices in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to olefins. However, the ambiguity in the understanding of the mechanism has impeded the improvement of novel catalytic systems. Herein, by using density functional theory (DFT), we mapped a complex reaction network for the B2O3-catalyzed ODH of propane, which displayed a typical feature of interplay between the on-surface and off-surface channels through the whole reaction from the initiation stage to the termination stage. The results showed that the interplay between the channels in the two regimes was necessary in two aspects: On one hand, to guarantee high selectivity for olefin products, the gaseous channels need the intervention of the surface sites to eliminate the oxygenated intermediates, for example, alkoxyl radicals, that would otherwise evolve into deep oxidation products. On the other hand, to maintain the high conversion of propane, the catalyst surface needs gaseous radicals to regenerate reactive >BO· species. The mechanism also well explained the catalytic role of trace water and addressed the surface dynamical restructuring, thus constituting a plausible comprehensive understanding of the ODH of propane catalyzed by an oxygenated boron system.

1. Introduction
In recent years, a research upsurge has focused on boron-containing catalytic materials for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkane since the discovery that the hexagonal boron nitride is active for this reaction, especially its inhibition of alkane overoxidation to ensure high olefin selectivity. (1−3) A variety of boron-based materials, including elemental boron, (4) boride, (4,5) boron carbide, (4) boron oxide, (6) and boron phosphate, (7) were observed to exhibit catalytic properties similar to those of h-BN, proving that the catalytic performance is inherently related to the boron element.
Most of the boron-based catalysts are bulk catalysts with low specific surface area, resulting in limited available active sites and relatively high reaction temperature (>530 °C). Increasing the specific surface area (8,9) and surface functionalization (10,11) are two effective ways to improve the catalytic performance. Many studies have identified that the catalytic activity relies on the presence of the oxygenated boron species (B–O/B–OH) on the surface. On the basis of this understanding, several groups (6,12,13) fabricated supported boron oxide to achieve better performance by increasing the dispersion degree of B–O/B–OH. For example, Lu and coworkers (6) prepared a mesoporous silica SBA-15-supported B2O3 catalyst and reported a significantly lowered temperature (405 °C) at which the catalyst of 10 wt % B2O3/SBA-15 (BOS) started to display activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), and the olefin selectivity was as high as 94.6%. The high reaction activity and olefin selectivity render the supported B2O3 a promising catalyst for the practical application of ODH of alkanes.
Recently, a consensus has been reached on the catalytic mechanism of the high activity and product selectivity of the boron-containing system. (2,3,14) For example, the catalytic activity is strongly correlated to the quantity of oxygenated boron sites, (15) and C2 and C1 products are generated from both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. (16) In the meantime, debates also exist. For example, by loading highly sparsely distributed boron on the molecular sieve, Hermans and coworkers reported that isolated BO3 units had no activity, (17) and recently, Xiao and coworkers reported the opposite finding. (18) They also reported different observations on the influence of the support in the B2O3@SiO2 system. Hermans and coworkers proposed that the support inhibited the activity, (12) whereas Xiao et al. reported that the support may promote the activity via hydrogen bonds between the support and the active oxygenated boron sites. (18)
These debates reflect the insufficient knowledge on the reaction mechanism of the catalytic system. This hinders the rational design and improvement of the catalytic systems and raises a compelling need for a systematic understanding of the mechanism that motivated this work. Herein, taking ODHP catalyzed by B2O3@SBA-15 (BOS) as the model concerning the consensus of the oxygenated boron sites as the active sites, we conducted mapping of the comprehensive reaction network. In the network, the mechanism enveloped elementary steps that were grouped into three stages, that is, initiation, propagation, and termination. The key species and elementary reaction steps were systematically studied. The conclusion of this work may deepen our understanding of the mechanism and provide a theoretical basis for the preparation and application of boron-containing catalysts with improved performance in the alkane ODH reaction.
2. Methodology
2.1. Models
The silica-supported B2O3 model was prepared by anchoring various typical oxygenated B species on a layered mica structure. The mica cluster model was prepared from the layered crystal structure of mica shared by Materials Studio Software, in total containing 87 atoms. The peripheral 45 atoms were frozen during the optimization. The surface site of the core region of mica to support oxygenated B species and the typical tricoordinated oxygenated B sites are demonstrated in Scheme 1. For the B2O3 structure on the surface, three tricoordinated species with one to four B2O3 units, identified by 11B NMR and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in our previous work, (6) are employed to uncover the predominant reaction pathways. A previous mechanistic study proposed the metastable boron structures, including B–B or B–H, on the surface to be responsible for the catalysis reaction. (19) Concerning the abundant presence of dioxygen under ODH conditions, it is less likely for these reductive metastable boron structures to survive with a sufficient quantity accessible for alkane in an oxidative environment at high temperature, and thus they were not considered here.

2.2. Computational Method
All stationary points were obtained from full optimization at the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) level (20−22) by using the Gaussian09 package. (23) The influences of the diffuse function, basis set, dispersion correction, and basis set superposition error (BSSE) correction were evaluated in our recent work (24) and qualified the use of the employed methodology. Vibrational frequencies were calculated to confirm each stationary point as a minimum or a saddle point and to abstract the zero-point energy correction and the entropic contribution. The temperature and pressure used to evaluate the Gibbs free energy were 298.15 K and 1 atm, respectively. For each elementary reaction, the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) method (25) was employed to verify that the transition state connected the two minima of the reactant and the product, respectively.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Elementary Reaction Steps
In previous work, upon noting the difference between the ODH catalyzed by boron-based and metal oxide catalysts, we proposed a mechanism (2,6,10) including the contributions of both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions to describe the conversion of light alkanes in the boron-based catalytic systems. This mechanism was confirmed by a recent spectroscopic study of Zhang et al., in which the gaseous methyl radicals in the h-BN-catalyzed ODHP reaction were captured by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), and provided evidence of gas-phase radical pathways. (16) Herein an extensive discussion is presented to constitute a comprehensive understanding of the B2O3-catalyzed ODHP with typical processes on the surface and in the gas phase (off-surface) taken into account. The whole ODH reaction was considered to proceed in three stages: (1) the initiation stage during which the radical species were generated, (2) the propagation stage during which alkane molecules were activated by on-surface and gaseous reactive species, and (3) the termination stage during which radicals were eliminated by means of radical rebound.
3.1.1. Initiation Stage
3.1.1.1. Direct Activation of Alkanes in Gas Phase
The initiation reactions in the gas phase were considered to be triggered mainly via the hydrogen abstraction (H-abstraction) of C3H8 and H2O by dioxygen. Dioxygen is known to have a triplet ground state (3Σg–, T0) under ambient conditions. Vertical excitation of dioxygen from its ground state to its first singlet excited state (1Δg, S1) required an energy of ∼20 kcal/mol. (26,27) This suggests that the excitation of dioxygen is possibly accessible under the ODH reaction conditions. Thus, in this work, the H-abstraction of C–H and O–H bonds by O2, in both its T0 and S1 states, was studied.
For the dehydrogenation of both C3H8 and H2O by dioxygen in its ground state (Table 1, eqs 1 and 2), high free-energy barriers were obtained, indicating that these reactions were slow processes. The barrier to the activation of the C–H bond was ca. 5–10 kcal/mol lower than that to the activation of the O–H bond. The lower free-energy barriers to the H-abstraction from C3H8 than to that from H2O were also consistent with the weaker bond strength of the C–H bond in C3H8 (ΔHf298 = 98.0 kcal/mol) (28) than that of the O–H bond in H2O (ΔHf298 = 119.2 kcal/mol). (28) In the experimental studies, there was abundant C3H8 in the reaction system, whereas there was only a trace amount of H2O. Thus, if the initiation in the gas phase is to be taken into account, then it is reasonable to consider the H-abstraction of C3H8 and to neglect that of H2O. When considering O2 in its first excited state (1Δg, S1), the reaction barriers to H-abstraction were significantly reduced by 15.3 (C3H8) and 22.3 kcal/mol (H2O), respectively.
Table 1. Key Stationary Points (Reactant (RC), Transition State (TS), and Intermediate (IM)) and the Corresponding Relative Free Energies (Free-Energy Barrier, ΔG‡, and Reaction Free Energy, ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Possible Gaseous Processes during the Initiation Stage
In addition, the conversion of propane to propene via a concerted process to dehydrogenate two H atoms by a singlet O2 was calculated with a barrier of 9.7 kcal/mol. These data showed that dioxygen in its excited state displayed high reactivity toward H-abstraction. We note that experimental studies have shown an induction period of a couple of hours in the boron-based alkane ODH catalytic systems. This ruled out the possibility of the rich presence of a singlet dioxygen in the induction period concerning its high reactivity.
3.1.1.2. Activation of the Surface Sites
B–OH sites were considered to be responsible for the catalytic ability in alkane ODH. They may be generated in multiple ways, for example, the native B–OH sites could be created during the fabrication of the catalysts, and the in-situ-generated sites could be generated through the hydrolysis of B–O–B or B–O–Si bonds. In B2O3, the abundant thermodynamically stable B–O–B bridges constitute the backbone and can be hydrolyzed under ODH conditions.
3.1.1.2.1. Hydrolysis to Breed More B–OH Sites
Both experimental and computational studies identified that the presence of trace water can promote the catalytic reaction with an increased conversion of alkanes. (2,6,10,11,19) Calculated reaction energetics in the gas phase (Table 1, eq 2i,ii) suggested that this promotion effect was energetically demanding and was less likely to happen in the gas phase. In previous work, by means of experimental characterization and theoretical calculations, we proposed that water could assist the breeding of more >B–OH/–B–(OH)2 sites on the catalyst surface by hydrolyzing the surface B–O–B/Si–O–B bridges in the backbone or in the thermodynamically more stable boroxol ring, by which the amorphousness of the surface was enhanced with the rich distribution of >B–OH/–B–(OH)2 sites. (2,6,10,11) In recent combined experimental and computational studies of the h-BN-catalyzed ODH reaction, the water molecule was proposed to assist the reaction by breaking the in-situ-generated B–B–B bonds to form B–OH and B–H groups. (19) This opinion is interesting, but it requires an extensive investigation because it seems to be a challenging task to dynamically generate a sufficient quantity of reductive B–B–B moieties in the oxidative atmosphere. We are evaluating this opinion and will share the results in the future once available. Here we will not discuss this possibility.
In the presence of water molecules, the B–O–B bridge can be hydrolyzed with a barrier of 15–32 kcal/mol (Table 2, eq 6i–v), showing that water molecules may break the boroxol ring to generate more B–OH groups. In addition, the B–O–Si bridge could also hydrolyze with a barrier of 9–27 kcal/mol (Table 2, eq 5i–iii) to produce B–OH and Si–OH, suggesting that B2O3 may dissociate from the surface of SiO2 and catalyze the reaction in gas phase in the form of boron clusters. These data are consistent with the mechanism we proposed in recent work (6) and explain the decrease in B–O–B and B–O–Si bridges during the ODHP observed in the experimental studies.

3.1.1.2.2. B–OH Dehydrogenation to Produce the Active B–O· Site
The in-situ-generated −B–OH groups, either by breaking the boroxol ring or by breaking the backbone B–O–B/B–O–Si bridges, had two implications: On one hand, this suggested that the catalytic surface may dynamically restructure itself under ODH conditions. On the other hand, in view of their positive correlation to the increase in the catalyst activity during the induction stage, one could reasonably deduce that −B–OH groups play key roles in the ODH reactions.
To participate in the ODH reaction, the −B–OH groups should first be dehydrogenated. The calculations showed that the dehydrogenation of B–OH had a high reaction barrier to overcome (Table 3, eq 7i–iii), in accord with the experimental observation of an induction period in the B2O3-catalyzed ODH. In this stage, the H-abstraction of B–OH relied on the presence of atmospheric dioxygen. The free-energy barrier to the H-abstraction was calculated to be ca. 45–55 kcal/mol by O2(T0) and ca. 22–29 kcal/mol by O2(S1).
Table 3. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG‡ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Dehydrogenation of the Surface >B–OH Sites to Produce Active B–O Species
It is worth noting that the neighboring Si–OH could form a hydrogen bond with the B–OH to stabilize the transition state and assist the dehydrogenation by triplet O2 with a reduced reaction barrier (36.1 kcal/mol; see Table 3, eq 8ii) compared with the unassisted case (54.6 kcal/mol; see Table 3, eq 8i). This suggested that those surface Si–OH groups of the silica support, which are hydrogen-bonded to B–OH sites, may promote the dehydrogenation of B–OH and assist in the generation of B–O· radical species.
The dehydrogenation barrier to the reactions by oxygenated radical species is relatively lower, which will be discussed in the propagation stage (eqs 16 and 17).
The initiation resulted in the formation of >B–O· and ·OOH radicals. These highly reactive species then invoked the dehydrogenation of propane substrate via the surface channel (>B–O·) and the gas phase channel (·OOH), respectively.
The possibility of generating a ≡Si─O· active site was also evaluated, and its formation was more strongly endothermic (55.7 vs 45.1 kcal/mol) than the formation of the >B–O· site (Table S2). It was thus considered not competitive to trigger the dehydrogenation of alkanes versus >B–O· sites, and this will not be discussed in this work. However, at a higher temperature, it is possible for the formation of ≡Si─O· active sites to be sufficient enough to bring a noticeable contribution to the reaction.
3.1.1.2.3. Direct Dehydrogenation to Produce Boronane
The direct activation of propane at the B–OH site (eq 9a–f), the B–O–Si site (eq 9g), and the B–O–B of boroxol ring (eq 9h–k) produced boronane (Table 4). This step was energetically demanding with a free-energy barrier of ΔG‡= 64.5–78.0 kcal/mol (eq 9a–k). In addition, the produced boronanes were very unstable. It is known that in organic synthesis, alkylated boron species are widely used to initiate radical chain reactions. This is in agreement with the strong endothermic nature of boronane formation demonstrated in our calculations (eqs 9 and 10). Concerning the high energy cost, the direct activation of propane at the B–OH sites was not considered as a competitive pathway.

3.1.2. Propagation Stage
3.1.2.1. Processes in the Gas Phase
3.1.2.1.1. Dehydrogenation of Alkanes
The gaseous oxygenated radical species (·OOH and ·OH) are highly reactive and able to abstract hydrogen from the hydrogen-rich propane in their vicinity (Table 5). The calculated free-energy barriers were 0.6 (by ·OH, eq 11) and 22.1 kcal/mol (by ·OOH, eq 12), respectively, which reflected the higher reactivity of ·OH than that of ·OOH.
Table 5. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG‡ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Gaseous Channels of the ODHP
The produced ·C3H7 could further undergo dehydrogenation to form C3H6 with a relatively low barrier (for example, 15.0 kcal/mol by O2(T0) or barrierless and exothermic by ΔG = −24.2 kcal/mol by O2(S1)) or β-scission reaction with a higher barrier (eq 13) to produce ethylene and methyl. The low barriers to the formation of propene implicated a fast process, indicating that the gaseous channel for the formation of olefins cannot be ignored. The evolution of the methyl radicals produced from the more energy-demanding β-scission process has been addressed in previous work (16,29) and will not be discussed here.
3.1.2.1.2. Formation of Alkoxyl Radical
The ·OOH was a double-edged sword. As seen in Table 6, on the one hand, it could dehydrogenate C3H8 (eq 12) and ·C3H7 (eq 33) to promote the olefin formation; on the other hand, it could bind with ·C3H7 to produce an alkoxyl radical (eq 15). The alkoxyl radical was a key intermediate in the formation of deep-oxidation products, for example, alcohol, aldehyde, ketone, CO, and CO2. The deep oxidation was unwanted because it could reduce the olefin selectivity. The formation of an alkoxyl radical was calculated to be exothermic by 22.7 kcal/mol and may follow a two-step pathway with a spontaneous radical rebound to form a peroxide intermediate (eq 15ia), which then decomposes to produce an alkoxyl radical and a hydroxyl radical (eq 15ib). Concerning the high reaction temperature, we also calculated the energetics of the concerted pathway, which faced a free-energy barrier of 20.0 kcal/mol to overcome (eq 15ii). These data showed that the ·OOH radical could react with an alkyl radical to produce an alkoxyl radical and compete against the activation of propane by ·OOH (22.1 kcal/mol, eq 12) under ODH conditions. Thus exploring the reaction pathways to eliminate ·OC3H7 in the catalytic system could shed light on the origin of the remarkable high olefin selectivity and the low overoxidation products.

We note that this elementary reaction also offered an explanation to the experimental observation of a reaction order of 0.5 for O2, which implied the breakage of the O–O bond and suggested that this breakage could occur in the gas phase.
3.1.2.2. Propagation Processes on the Catalyst Surface
Oxygenated boron sites (B–O/B–OH, BxOy) have been proposed to be responsible species for the catalytic activity, (2,3,10,11,30,31) whereas their roles in catalyzing the conversion of propane to propene remain uncertain. Through the analysis of the calculated elementary reactions, we identified two important properties of the oxygenated boron group that may result in their high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions, that is, the H-abstraction ability of >BO· responsible for the activation of propane and the oxophilicity of the tricoordination of boron responsible for the inhibition of deep oxidation.
3.1.2.2.1. H-Abstraction by >BO·
During the initiation stage, the >B–O· species was slowly generated (eqs 7 and 8). Its generation can be promoted by oxygenated radicals (see Table 7), for example, by ·OH with a barrier of 6.5 kcal/mol and by ·OOH with a barrier of 36.3 kcal/mol. These reactions are much faster compared with those in eqs 1 and 2.
Table 7. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG‡ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Dehydrogenation of Propane by the Surface >B–O Sites
The >BO· can then facilely activate propane by H-abstraction. The reaction barrier was 4.5 kcal/mol for α-H (1°-H) and 2.8 kcal/mol for β-H (2°-H), respectively. The >BO· could also easily dehydrogenate the H2O and H2O2 to supply reactive gaseous oxygenated radicals with barriers of 1.3–3.0 kcal/mol (eqs 20 and 21).
3.1.2.2.2. Radical Adsorption and Substitution at Tricoordinated >B–OH
From the stereochemistry, boron preferred to adopt a planar tricoordinated conformation with an sp2 hybridization mode. In some materials or catalytic reaction processes, (3) the metastable tetra-coordination boron with sp3 hybridization could also exist as a transient state to mediate an SN2-type ligand exchange at the B site. From the view of the electronic structure, this was due to the empty pz orbital in the sp2 boron, which could accept external electrons to form a coordination bond. This conformation was unstable and could easily restructure back to the planar conformation of the sp2 boron, during which either the newcomer may be repelled (reversible process) or one of the three existing groups on B may be replaced by the newcomer (SN2-type process). The ability of boron to rehybridize its orbitals enabled it to accommodate two types of reaction: One was the adsorption reaction for electron-rich molecules, and the other was the radical substitution reaction. Owing to the high affinity of boron for oxygen, (32) oxygen may be the right element to fulfill the two types of reactions. With this concept in mind, we have analyzed the elementary reactions of oxygenated radicals with the surface boron sites.
The calculated results (Table 8) show that the tricoordinated >B–OH could adsorb ·OH and ·OC3H7 with an energy barrier of 8.5 and 6.2 kcal/mol, respectively (eqs 22 and 23a). In contrast, it is difficult to adsorb ·OOH, which may be due to the weak nucleophilic ability of ·OOH.
Table 8. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG‡ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Substitution Reaction at the Triply Coordinated >B–OH Sites
The nascent transient tetra-coordinated >B(OH)(·OH) and >B(OH)(·OC3H7) species could then decompose facilely with a barrier of 8.2 and 1.2 kcal/mol to kick out the intruding ·OH and ·OC3H7, respectively. They could also release the native ·OH to accomplish the radical substitution reaction with a barrier of 8.2 (equivalent to the reverse process of eq 22) and 11.3 kcal/mol (eq 23b), respectively. The former substitution reaction completed the oxygen exchange process between H2O/O2 and the surface-oxygenated boron species, which explained the isotope labeling experimental result, (2) and the latter adsorbed ·OC3H7 on the surface to eliminate it from the gas phase and prevented its further oxidation in the gas phase to unwanted deep-oxidation products.
Compared with the stepwise substitution of ·OC3H7 for OH at the >B–OH site, the substitution of ·C3H7 was a concerted reaction with a much higher barrier of 48.3 kcal/mol for the first ·C3H7 versus 56.1 kcal/mol for the second ·C3H7 (eq 24a,b). Furthermore, the produced boronane was very unstable and could be rapidly replaced by ·OC3H7 (eq 25a,b) or O2 (eq 26a,b).
These results showed that the tricoordinated >B–OH could adsorb the oxygenated radicals under ODH conditions, for example, ·OC3H7 and ·OH, but not alkyl radicals, for example, ·C3H7, which effectively detained the alkoxy radicals on the surface and freed the alkyl radicals in gas phase. The evolution of the alkyl radicals in the gas phase and the >B–OC3H7 groups on the surface will be discussed hereinafter.
3.1.3. Termination Stage
3.1.3.1. Elimination of ·C3H7 via Gaseous and Surface Channels
During the propagation stage, part of ·C3H7 could be adsorbed by >BO· to form >BOR species (eqs 23 and 30), and the other ·C3H7 accumulated in the gas phase. These gaseous ·C3H7 species could then evolve to olefin products via another H-abstraction step by oxygenated radicals in the gas phase (Table 9, eqs 27 and 28) or on the surface (Table 9, eq 29). All of these radical termination reactions were fast processes. A small amount of ·CH2CH2CH3 underwent β-scission to produce ethylene and C1 species (eq 13).
Table 9. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG‡ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Processes Responsible for the Elimination of the Propyl Radical
3.1.3.2. Elimination of ·OC3H7 on Surface
As previously discussed, the alkyl groups on the catalyst surface were in the form of >B–OC3H7 (eq 23b) or transient >B(OH)(·OC3H7) (eq 23a). The >B–OC3H7 could also be produced by the rapid radical rebound of >BO· with ·C3H7 (eq 30 in Table 10).
Table 10. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG‡ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Processes Responsible for the Elimination of the ·OC3H7 Radical
Regarding the dehydrogenation process of >B–OC3H7 on the surface, it was difficult for its direct conversion to propene to proceed via an intramolecular H shift to transfer its β-H atom to oxygen with a barrier of 60.1 kcal/mol (eq 31). The participation of O2 greatly reduced the barrier by 15.0 kcal/mol for O2(T0) and 35.2 kcal/mol for O2(S1), respectively. The O2 mediated the H transfer from the β-C to the >BO site to assist the breakage of the >BO–C3H6 bond and the production of olefin (eq 32).
Compared with the tricoordinated structure, the tetra-coordinated >B(OH)(·OC3H7) was less stable and could easily transform into a tricoordination boron by dissociating a B–O bond, which provided opportunities for the activation of BOC3H7. Calculations suggested that the −OH group on the tetra-coordinated B site could easily dehydrogenate the β-C to form a molecule of H2O (eq 33), leaving behind the >B–(OC3H6)·. The consumption of the nascent >B–(OC3H6)· needed external assistance to break the >BO–C bond and release propene by capturing an H from the H-rich species in its vicinity. For example, >B–(OC3H6)· dehydrogenates ·OOH with a barrier of 16.5 kcal/mol (eq 32bi) or ·C3H7 with a barrier of 7.7 kcal/mol (eq 32bii). It was also possible for the >B–OC3H6 to hydrolyze in the case of collision with a water molecule and produce the tetra-coordinated >B(OH)(O(H)C3H6)·, which could rapidly dissociate and release a ·C3H6OH radical (eq 32biii).
Another elimination pathway of the tetra-coordinated >B(OH)(·OC3H7) was the intramolecular rearrangement of >BOC3H7, in which the β-H transferred to oxygen to break the B–O bond and release the ·C3H6OH species (eq 34a). This species could dehydrogenate ·OOH (eq 34bi) or ·C3H7 (eq 34bii) that collided with it to produce stable H2O and propene products.
3.2. Reaction Network
On the basis of the above elementary reactions, we depicted a reaction network to map a comprehensive view of the B2O3-catalyzed ODHP, with both surface and gaseous species and their evolution pathways taken into account. (See Figure 1 for the initiation stage, Figure 2 for the propagation stage, and Figure 3 for the termination stage.) The key features of the network are as follows.

3.2.1. Generation of Reactive Oxygenated Species
The reactive oxygenated species assumed the primary responsibility for alkane dehydrogenation, and their generation was a prerequisite to trigger the catalytic reaction. Given the fact that the presence of dioxygen was a must, the current understanding considered that reactive oxygenated species were originated mainly from the reaction of the catalyst surface with O2, which may abstract a hydrogen atom from the surface site, for example, >B–OH (eqs 7 and 8), or from the gaseous species, for example, C3H8 (eq 1) or H2O (eq 2), and produce reactive ·OOH, ·OH, and >BO·. These reactions were slow processes, in accord with the observation of an induction stage in the experimental studies. (6,30,33,34)
These nascent radicals then bred more oxygenated radicals, such as gaseous species ·OOH(g) or ·OH(g), by reacting with O2 (eqs 14 and 15) or H2Ox (eqs 20 and 21), and surface species, >BO· (on surface), by reacting with >B–OH (eqs 16 and 17). The accumulated oxygenated radicals were the main species responsible for the ODHP reactions. Alkoxyl radicals were among the oxygenated radicals generated during the oxidation of propane. They were important intermediates leading to the unwanted deep oxidation of alkane rather than to the wanted alkene products. Thus alkoxyl radicals should be eliminated in due course to guarantee high olefin selectivity in ODHP. This will be addressed with the third issue.
3.2.2. Dehydrogenation of Propane
The conversion of propane to propene requires two sequential dehydrogenation steps, with the first step being more energy demanding. Oxygenated radical species significantly accelerate the dehydrogenation rate of alkanes; for example, the barrier to the first H-abstraction of propane by O2(T0) was calculated to be 50.7 kcal/mol (eq 1), which decreased to 22.1 kcal/mol by ·OOH (eq 12), to 9.7 kcal/mol by O2(S1) (eq 1), and to 0.6–2.8 kcal/mol by ·OH and >BO· (eqs 11, 18, and 19). According to these results, the ability of these oxygenated species to activate propane may be ranked in the following order
The second dehydrogenation step of propane proceeded faster and benefited from the high reactivity of the propyl radical. In the gas phase, the barrier was calculated to be 15.0 kcal/mol for O2(T0) to fulfill the dehydrogenation (eq 14). In the meantime, this step generated more reactive oxygenated radicals, for example, ·OOH, to promote the gaseous (eq 12) or surface-mediated (eqs 17–19) dehydrogenation of propane.
3.2.3. Elimination of Gaseous Alkoxyl Species
Under oxidative conditions, transient alkyl radicals could facilely form alkoxyl radicals (for example, eq 15). These radicals were the key precursors responsible for the formation of deep oxidation products, such as COx, alcohols, and aldehydes, and thus they need to be eliminated in a timely manner to guarantee the high selectivity of olefin products.
By comparing the affinities of alkyl and alkoxyl at the surface boron sites, mimicked by propyl and propoxy, respectively, we found that the surface boron sites could efficiently adsorb alkoxy (eq 23) but not alkyl (eqs 9 and 10). This unique feature of the boron-based ODHP catalytic system was attributed to the oxophilicity of boron. (6) The adsorbed alkoxy could then dehydrogenate a second H atom at the surface site (eqs 32 and 33) or release alcoholic radicals, which may then be dehydrated in the gas phase to produce olefins (eq 34).
3.2.4. Assistance of Trace Water
Trace water present in the boron-based ODH catalytic systems may assist the reactions by hydrolyzing the >B─OB</>B─OSi≡ bonds or B–B bonds to release more >B–OH and >B–H sites. (2,6,10,19) These processes have been shown to be reversible both theoretically (2) and experimentally, (19) suggesting the shuttle effect of water molecules. These results well explained the observation of isotope exchange between water molecules and the surface-oxygenated sites.
In this work, we focused on a more detailed description of the assistance of water molecule in breaking the >B─OB</>B─OSi≡ bonds. The calculations showed that under ODH conditions, the gaseous water molecules could insert into the B–O bond of the boroxol ring or the linear >B–O–B< bridges. This suggested that the trace water molecules may break surface-oxygenated boron species to promote the generation of more >B–OH, some of which may even detach from the surface in the form of small clusters. The clusters may redeposit on the surface, and it was also possible for them to be activated in gas phase or transported by the air to flow away from the catalyst bed, which may be a plausible explanation for the marginal loss of boron observed in experimental studies.
In addition, here we also investigated the possibility for water molecules to react with reactive intermediates, that is, with >B–O· (eq 20) and >B–(OC3H6)· (eq 32biii). The free-energy barriers were calculated to be 3.0 and 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively, and both processes were exothermic (−3.4 and −5.8 kcal/mol), indicating that water molecules, if colliding appropriately, could get involved in the on-surface channels. These results suggested that the role of water molecules may be more complicated than what we have learned, and an extensive investigation is expected.
3.2.5. Dynamical Restructuring of the Catalyst Surface
The dynamical restructuring of the catalyst surface has been widely recognized in heterogeneous catalysis. In the boron-based ODH catalytic systems, recent studies (6,7,12,35) have shown that the speciation of boron varied during the reaction, with increased tricoordinated species and decreased tetra-coordinated species.
Currently, we still lack a molecular level of understanding on how the catalyst surface evolved during the reactions. Transient processes involving bond cleavage/formation could be evaluated at the quantum mechanical (QM) level, whereas translational migration on the relatively longer time scale was, in general, beyond the reach of the QM theory, and approximation and classic models should be used depending on the nature of the catalyst surface.
Here we have prepared various models as a compensation to mimic the surface sites that were potentially involved in the reactions. These models covered the majority of surface boron species under ODH conditions, for example, the boroxol ring, the contact layer of B2O3 anchored on silica via the B–O–Si bridge, the B–O–B backbone of the linear surface species, and the doubly hydroxylated boron species. The calculations showed that it was necessary for all non-B–OH sites to first convert to −B–OH species before being actively involved in the catalytic reactions. This implied that the rich presence of hydroxyl groups bound to B could improve the catalytic performance of the boron species.
The calculations also showed that trace water could cleave the bonds between the boron species and the silica support, suggesting that under ODH conditions, the oxygenated boron cluster could move away from its original position, either migrating on the surface or vaporizing into the gas phase. These possibilities do not change the mechanism we reported here and will be investigated in our future work, in which we will apply advanced simulation protocols to screen possible labile boron species and study their dynamic behaviors.
3.2.6. Interplay of the On- and Off-Surface Processes
In previous work, we proposed a surface-mediated radical mechanism for the boron-based ODH catalytic system. The gaseous channels have been confirmed in recent spectroscopic studies. (16,29) Here we extended our previous mechanistic study and tentatively mapped a reaction network to demonstrate the interplay of the on- and off-surface channels (Figures 1–3). The nonpolar nature of propane and O2 dictated a weak interaction between them and the B2O3 surface under ambient conditions, which may be further weakened under ODH conditions owing to the entropic effect at high temperature (>450 °C), and thus we could not expect to activate O2 or propane via strong adsorption on the surface to trigger the reaction during the initial stage. This implied that appropriate collision events between the gaseous species and the surface were the key to the initiation of the catalytic reaction. Thus we consider that the interplay of the on- and off-surface processes is crucial at the beginning of the ODHP, and the channels in the two regimes (on the catalyst surface and off-surface into the gas phase) thereafter communicate with each other and coexist during the whole reaction.
As seen in Figures 1–3, during the initiation stage, the collision of the gaseous propane and dioxygen with the >B–OH sites generated both active surface (>BO·) and gaseous (·OOH) species, which triggered the ODHP on the surface and in the gas phase.
The channels in the two regimes maintained mutual exchange during the later propagation and termination stages. This was necessary because the gaseous radical chain reactions featured low chemoselectivity, whereas the surface >B–O· species had a short lifetime and could not proliferate in a self-sustainable way. In other words, to maintain the high reactivity for the conversion of propane and the high selectivity for propene, we need to eliminate the unwanted gaseous radical species that would evolve to deep-oxidation products, for example, alkoxyl radicals, in a timely manner by the aid of surface boron sites to guarantee a high yield of olefin products, whereas the regeneration of surface >BO· species relies on the collision of >B–OH with reactive gaseous species, for example, the ·OH radical.
4. Conclusions
In this work, a systematic study was carried out to understand the mechanism of the B2O3-catalyzed ODH reaction of propane. The whole reaction was divided into three stages by adopting the concept of the chain reaction, that is, the initiation stage to generate reactive species to thus trigger the ODHP, the propagation stage to convert alkane to alkene by the aid of the in-situ-generated active oxygenated species, and the termination stage to eliminate the reactive radicals.
The key intermediates and the elementary steps were obtained to construct a reaction network for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic issues for both gaseous and surface processes. The competitive relationships of these reaction pathways are clarified in terms of their kinetics and thermodynamics. On the basis of these results, the important role of boron in the ODH reaction was discussed: The strong dehydrogenation ability of >BO· ensures the high activity in the ODH of alkane, and the strong oxophilicity of tricoordination boron contributes the selectivity. This emphasizes the interplay of the on-surface channels and the off-surface (gaseous) channels; that is, the generation of >BO· requires the participation of gaseous reactive species, and the guarantee of high selectivity for olefin products requires surface boron sites to eliminate the gaseous alkoxyl radicals.
The dynamical restructuring of the catalytic surface was also discussed and correlated to the catalytic role of trace water present in the catalytic systems. Under ODH conditions, the water molecules may hydrolyze the surface B–O–B/B–O–Si bridges to modify the texture and chemical environment of the surface and to breed more B–OH species.
