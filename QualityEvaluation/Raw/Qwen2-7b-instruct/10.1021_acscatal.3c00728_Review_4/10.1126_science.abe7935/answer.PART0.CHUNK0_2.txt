[1] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."
[2] "By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[3] "BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure."
[4] "For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation."
[5] "The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst-1 h-1) of 3600 L kg1 h1."
[6] "Figure 1A shows the dependence of propane conversion on reaction temperature over various catalysts."
[7] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560C, respectively."
[8] "In ODHP, high propane conversion usually leads to easy overoxidation (18)."
[9] "For example, VOx-based catalysts have selectivity for light olefins of <50%, with CO2 as a major product when propane conversion exceeds 30% in the ODHP (fig. S8)."
[10] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C)."
[11] "Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."
[12] "As shown in Fig. 1D, the propane conversion and propene and/or ethene selectivities were 32.5% and 53.8% and/or 28.6%, respectively, at the beginning of the reaction."
[13] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."
[14] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A)."
[15] "The fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."
[16] "An additional broad signal appeared at 15 to 20 ppm, which was observed on the borosilicate zeolite and assigned to the extra-framework boron species [e.g., B(OH)3] with close silanol and/or (H2O)n (35)."
[17] "Considering that dehydration of a portion of B[4] sites (H+[H2O]n removal) could form B[3] sites, which is a reversible and stochastic process, the B[3]B[4] spatial correlations would be inevitable if there were agglomerated boron species (e.g., BOB)."
[18] "Therefore, the undetectable B[3]B[4] spatial correlations suggest isolated boron sites on BS-1."
[19] "The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at 905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm1 (fig. S24)."
[20] "Raising the temperature substantially decreased tetrahedral boron signals, confirming the transformation of B[4] to B[3] at high temperature, in good agreement with the typical features of framework boron sites (fig. S25)."
[21] "In addition, the structure of BS-1 was investigated using gas-phase cluster analysis from the solid structure, which is bombarded from the catalyst and randomly formed to contain compositional and structural information."
[22] "Time-of-flight mass spectra (ToF-MS) showed different gas-phase clusters from the BS-1 (with metallic Cu as sample support), where the boron-containing clusters of BO2 and BO3 and a variety of borosilicate ions [SizB1OyHx, z = 1, 2] were detected."
[23] "These data also suggest isolated boron in the BS-1, in good agreement with the NMR results."
[24] "The hydroxyl groups on the isolated boron were identified using NMR. Figure 3A shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of BS-1 and B/S-1, with signals at 1.8 ppm assigned to terminal silanol hydroxyl groups (SiOH) on the zeolite matrix (Fig. 3B, I) (35, 37, 38)."
[25] "In addition, B/S-1 has another signal at 2.9 ppm related to the fully hydrolyzed boron species [e.g., B(OH)3], whereas the BS-1 exhibits four additional 1H signals at 2.1, 2.6, 3.5, and 4.5 ppm."
[26] "The signals at 3.5 and 2.1 ppm should be coproduced from the hydrolysis of the SiOB linkage in zeolite framework."
[27] "This phenomenon was also confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy of the fresh and used BS-1 catalyst (fig. S33), which explained the slight increase of propane conversion after a long-period ODHP test (Fig. 1D)."
[28] "More importantly, SiOH nests (1.8, 3.6 ppm) and fully hydrolyzed boron species (2.9 ppm) were undetectable in the 1H-1H DQ spectrum of the fresh and used BS-1 (Fig. 3C) (33), confirming that the deep hydrolysis of SiOB species and boron leaching were effectively inhibited (fig. S34); this was supported by the in situ FTIR study (fig. S35) showing that hydrolysis of the SiOB linkage is reversible."
[29] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."
[30] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
[31] "The kinetic parameters of B-Beta were in good agreement with those of BS-1 (fig. S48)."
[32] "The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(SiO)2BOH] but exhibits undetectable B[OHO(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species."
[33] "In addition, even if a small amount of B(OH)3 species exists on BS-1, such a species would not contribute to propane conversion, as supported by the extremely low activity of the B/S-1 catalyst (boric acid loaded on S-1 zeolite; Fig. 1A)."
[34] "The reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation on BS-1 was explored using density functional theory calculation (figs. S51 to S54)."
[35] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52)."
[36] "The other hydroxyl group in boron was able to form a hydrogen bond with SiOH and further constrain O2, as shown in Fig. 3D."
[37] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface."

1. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these different pathways plays a crucial role in catalyst performance, enhancing the efficiency of the reaction by optimizing the interactions between reactants and the catalyst surface. This understanding can guide the rational design of more effective dehydrogenation catalysts by incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework, as demonstrated by the BS-1 catalyst's improved performance and durability.

2. The implications of the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase radical reactions for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. By improving the understanding of how boron-based catalysts operate, researchers can tailor the catalyst structure to enhance specific reaction steps, leading to higher selectivity and yield of desired products. This knowledge can also inform strategies to mitigate unwanted side reactions, such as overoxidation, by controlling the catalyst's active sites and their environment. Additionally, the insights gained can aid in the development of more robust catalysts that maintain high activity and selectivity under challenging reaction conditions, such as those involving water, which is crucial for practical applications in industries relying on the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.
