The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions. The synergistic effects between these mechanisms play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst. Specifically, the active B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the BS-1 catalyst demonstrates how the coordination environment around boron can be optimized to enhance dehydrogenation efficiency while suppressing overoxidation. This is achieved by efficiently activating molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation, and hindering the full hydrolysis of boron species, which is critical for maintaining the catalyst's activity and selectivity in a continuous test over extended periods. Moreover, the kinetic parameters of the reaction, such as the first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, suggest unique reaction pathways that differ from those of commonly used supported boron and h-BN catalysts. The density functional theory calculations further elucidate the importance of specific boron functionalities (like dihydroxyl groups) and nearby silanol species in facilitating the conversion of oxygen and propane through the construction of an eight-membered ring with hydrogen bonds, thereby reducing energy barriers and enhancing reaction efficiency.

The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. They suggest that by carefully engineering the coordination environment around boron, it may be possible to create more efficient dehydrogenation catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions, such as high water content, without significant loss of activity or selectivity. This approach could lead to the development of scalable applications for the production of propene from shale gas, potentially reducing dependence on petroleum and offering a cleaner alternative for propene production.

多维度的ODHP反应机制，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，对于理解整个反应网络具有重要意义。这些机制之间的协同作用在确定催化剂效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。具体而言，BS-1催化剂中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构展示了如何通过优化硼周围环境来增强脱氢效率并抑制过氧化。这通过高效激活分子氧和丙烷、促进脱氢以及阻止硼物种的全面水解实现，这对于维持催化剂在连续测试期间的活动性和选择性至关重要。此外，反应的动力学参数，如丙烷分压的一级速率依赖性，表明了独特的反应途径与常用的硼支持和h-BN催化剂不同。密度泛函理论计算进一步阐明了特定硼功能（例如二羟基）和附近硅醇基团在构建包含三个氢键的八元环中对于氧气和丙烷的协同转化的重要性，从而降低了能量壁垒并提高了反应效率。

这些协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。它们表明，通过精心设计硼周围的协调环境，可能能够创建更高效的脱氢催化剂，即使在苛刻的反应条件下也能保持较高的活性和选择性，而不会显著降低。这种方法有可能推动从页岩气生产丙烯的应用规模化发展，减少对石油的依赖，并提供一种更清洁的丙烯生产替代方案。
