[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers."
[2] "However, the BOB oligomers are associated with complete hydrolysis by water products to form boron with saturated hydroxyl groups (e.g., boric acid), which could deactivate the catalyst once the boric acid leaches from the reaction system because of the strong solubility of such species in water (24, 30)."
[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[4] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology."
[5] "The BS-1 catalyst had a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, whereas the supported boron and hBN had a second-order rate dependence."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This implies that the interactions and processes occurring at the surface of the catalyst and the reactions happening in the gas phase contribute to the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects between these two aspects are crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the ability of the catalyst to activate molecular oxygen and propane efficiently while hindering full boron hydrolysis is a key factor in maintaining high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. This synergy allows for the production of valuable olefin products with minimal overoxidation to CO2. Moreover, the water tolerance of the catalyst, as demonstrated by the BS-1 catalyst, which maintains its activity and selectivity even after water treatment and long-term operation, highlights the importance of balancing the catalytic properties with environmental factors. The first-order rate dependence of the BS-1 catalyst with respect to propane partial pressure suggests a unique reaction pathway that differs from those of supported boron and hexagonal carbon nitride (h-BN) catalysts, offering insights into optimizing the design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts.

氧化脱氢反应机制在硼基催化剂上的多维性质涉及表面和气相自由基反应。这表明，催化剂表面发生的作用以及气相中发生的反应共同构成了整体反应网络。这两个方面之间的协同作用对于催化剂性能和设计优化至关重要。具体而言，催化剂激活分子氧和丙烷的能力，同时阻止硼的完全水解，是维持ODHP反应高活性和选择性的关键因素。这种协同作用允许以最小的过氧化物形成CO2生产有价值的烯烃产品。此外，催化剂的水耐受性，如BS-1催化剂所展示的，在经过水处理和长期运行后仍能保持其活性和选择性，突出了平衡催化特性和环境因素的重要性。BS-1催化剂对丙烷分压的一级速率依赖性揭示了一种独特的反应途径，与支持硼和六方碳氮化物(h-BN)催化剂不同，为优化高效脱氢催化剂的设计提供了见解。
