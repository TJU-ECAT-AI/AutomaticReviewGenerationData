The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions. The synergistic effects between these mechanisms play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst. Specifically, the active B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the BS-1 catalyst demonstrates how the coordination environment around boron can be optimized to enhance dehydrogenation efficiency while suppressing overoxidation. This is achieved by efficiently activating molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation, and hindering the full hydrolysis of boron species, which is critical for maintaining the catalyst's activity and selectivity in a continuous test over extended periods. Moreover, the kinetic parameters of the reaction, such as the first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, suggest unique reaction pathways that differ from those of commonly used supported boron and h-BN catalysts. The density functional theory calculations further elucidate the importance of specific boron functionalities (like dihydroxyl groups) and nearby silanol species in facilitating the conversion of oxygen and propane through the construction of an eight-membered ring with hydrogen bonds, thereby reducing energy barriers and enhancing reaction efficiency.

The implications of these synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. They suggest that by carefully engineering the coordination environment around boron, it may be possible to create more efficient dehydrogenation catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions, such as high water content, without significant loss of activity or selectivity. This approach could lead to the development of scalable applications for the production of propene from shale gas, potentially reducing dependence on petroleum and offering a cleaner alternative for propene production.

多维度的ODHP反应机制，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，对于理解整个反应网络具有重要意义。这些机制之间的协同作用在确定催化剂效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。具体而言，BS-1催化剂中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构展示了如何通过优化硼周围环境来增强脱氢效率并抑制过氧化。这通过高效激活分子氧和丙烷、促进脱氢以及阻止硼物种的全面水解实现，这对于维持催化剂在连续测试期间的活动性和选择性至关重要。此外，反应的动力学参数，如丙烷分压的一级速率依赖性，表明了独特的反应途径与常用的硼支持和h-BN催化剂不同。密度泛函理论计算进一步阐明了特定硼功能（例如二羟基）和附近硅醇基团在构建包含三个氢键的八元环中对于氧气和丙烷的协同转化的重要性，从而降低了能量壁垒并提高了反应效率。

这些协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响深远。它们表明，通过精心设计硼周围的协调环境，可能能够创建更高效的脱氢催化剂，即使在苛刻的反应条件下也能保持较高的活性和选择性，而不会显著降低。这种方法有可能推动从页岩气生产丙烯的应用规模化发展，减少对石油的依赖，并提供一种更清洁的丙烯生产替代方案。

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these reactions enhances catalyst performance by facilitating efficient activation of reactants and suppressing unwanted side reactions, such as overoxidation leading to the formation of COx. This synergy is crucial for optimizing catalysts, particularly those featuring isolated boron species in a zeolite framework, which maintain high activity and selectivity under humid conditions, thus improving water tolerance.

The active sites identified in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) consist of B[OHO(H)Si]2 structures with isolated boron species. These sites efficiently activate molecular oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation while hindering complete hydrolysis of boron species, ensuring the catalyst's robustness against water treatment and long-term testing. The isolated boron species in the zeolite framework can undergo hydrolysis to generate more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups, which not only boosts catalytic activity but also reverses back into the SiOB linkage, demonstrating a dynamic equilibrium that supports the catalyst's durability.

The structure of BS-1 was characterized using advanced spectroscopic techniques, including 11B magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF-MS). These methods revealed the spatial arrangement of boron and hydrogen species within the zeolite framework, confirming the presence of isolated boron sites with dihydroxyl groups (B[OHO(H)Si]2) that play a critical role in the catalytic process. The kinetic parameters of the catalyst, including its first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, suggest a unique reaction mechanism that differs from conventional supported boron and hexagonal carbon nitride (h-BN) catalysts.

The reaction pathway over the BS-1 catalyst was elucidated through density functional theory calculations, which considered the influence of the zeolite framework on the reaction dynamics. The calculations demonstrated the importance of boron's dihydroxyl groups and nearby silanol species in promoting the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane, reducing energy barriers and enhancing reaction efficiency. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure further contributed to the reaction activity by stabilizing intermediate species and guiding the reaction pathways.

In summary, the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase radical reactions, facilitated by the unique structure and properties of isolated boron species in the zeolite framework, significantly enhance the performance of boron-based catalysts for ODHP. These insights provide a foundation for the rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework, and highlight the potential for scalable applications in the production of propene from shale gas, thereby reducing dependence on petroleum sources.

多维性质的氧化脱氢反应机制在硼基催化剂中涉及表面和气相自由基反应，这为整体反应网络提供了一个全面的理解。这些协同作用通过促进反应物的有效激活并抑制如过氧化导致的COx形成等不利副反应来增强催化剂性能。这种协同作用对于优化催化剂至关重要，尤其是那些包含在沸石框架中的孤立硼物种的催化剂，它们在潮湿条件下保持高活性和选择性，从而提高水的耐受性。

在沸石MFI框架（BS-1）中识别的活性位点由B[OHO(H)Si]2结构组成，其中包含孤立的硼物种。这些位点有效地激活分子氧和丙烷进行脱氢，同时阻止硼物种的完全水解，确保催化剂在水处理和长期测试过程中的稳定性。在沸石框架内的孤立硼物种可以经历水解生成更多B[OHO(H)Si]2组分，不仅增强了催化活性，而且可以逆向转化为SiOB连接，表明一种动态平衡支持催化剂的耐用性。

使用高级光谱技术，如11B魔角自旋核磁共振(NMR)光谱法和时间飞行质谱法(TOF-MS)，对BS-1的结构进行了表征。这些方法揭示了硼和氢物种在沸石框架内的空间排列，证实了存在包含两个羟基的孤立硼位点（B[OHO(H)Si]2），这对催化过程至关重要。催化剂的热力学参数，包括其与丙烷部分压力的第一阶速率依赖性，表明了独特的反应机制与传统支持硼和六方碳氮化物(h-BN)催化剂不同。

对BS-1催化剂的反应路径进行了密度泛函理论计算，考虑了沸石框架对反应动力学的影响。计算表明硼的两个羟基组分及其附近的硅醇基团在促进氧气和丙烷的协同转换、降低能量壁垒并增强反应效率方面的重要性。沸石微孔结构的约束效应进一步提高了反应活性，通过稳定中间物种并指导反应途径。

综上所述，表面和气相自由基反应之间的协同作用，由沸石框架内孤立硼物种的独特结构和属性增强，显著提高了硼基催化剂的ODHP性能。这些见解为设计高效脱氢催化剂提供了基础，整合硼位点到沸石框架中，并指出在从页岩天然气生产丙烯以减少石油来源依赖方面的潜在大规模应用潜力。

[14] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A)."
[15] "The fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."
[16] "An additional broad signal appeared at 15 to 20 ppm, which was observed on the borosilicate zeolite and assigned to the extra-framework boron species [e.g., B(OH)3] with close silanol and/or (H2O)n (35)."
[17] "Considering that dehydration of a portion of B[4] sites (H+[H2O]n removal) could form B[3] sites, which is a reversible and stochastic process, the B[3]B[4] spatial correlations would be inevitable if there were agglomerated boron species (e.g., BOB)."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This highlights the complexity of the overall reaction network, where surface reactions occur on the catalyst's active sites, while gas-phase reactions involve the activation and transformation of reactants in the atmosphere above the catalyst surface. The synergistic effects between these two dimensions contribute significantly to catalyst performance and efficiency, as they enable the effective use of both the catalyst's surface area for adsorption and the gas-phase reactions for product formation.

The implications of these synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization include the potential for enhancing selectivity, improving activity, and extending the catalyst's lifetime. By understanding how the catalyst's active sites interact with reactants and products at both the surface and in the gas phase, researchers can tailor the catalyst's composition, structure, and operating conditions to maximize these interactions. This includes optimizing the coordination environment around the boron species, as demonstrated by the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the BS-1 catalyst. This structure not only facilitates the activation of oxygen and propane but also inhibits the full hydrolysis of boron species, leading to improved water tolerance and durability.

Furthermore, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the isolated boron sites plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These hydroxyl groups act as active species for the reaction, contributing to the high activity of the catalyst. Moreover, they hinder full hydrolysis and dissolution, thereby ensuring the catalyst's stability during the reaction process. The isotope-labeled experiments confirm the importance of these hydroxyl groups, supporting their role in the reaction pathway.

In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, underscores the complexity of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects between these dimensions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, particularly in terms of enhancing selectivity, improving activity, and extending catalyst lifetime. Understanding and exploiting these synergies can lead to the development of more efficient and durable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应机制的多维特性涉及催化剂表面和气相自由基反应两个维度，这凸显了整体反应网络的复杂性。表面反应在催化剂活性位点上发生，而气相反应则涉及到大气层中反应物的激活和产物形成。这两种维度之间的协同作用对催化剂性能和优化具有重要意义，因为它们能够有效利用催化剂的表面积吸附反应物以及通过气相反应形成产品。

这些协同作用对于催化剂性能和设计优化的含义包括增强选择性、提高活性并延长催化剂寿命的可能性。通过理解催化剂活性位点如何与表面和气体中的反应物和产物相互作用，研究人员可以调整催化剂的组成、结构和操作条件，以最大化这些相互作用。这包括优化围绕硼物种的配位环境，正如BS-1催化剂中所展示的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构那样。这种结构不仅促进了氧气和丙烷的活化，而且抑制了硼物种的完全水解，从而提高了催化剂对水分的耐受性和持久性。

此外，孤立硼位点上的羟基的存在在反应机制中起着关键作用。这些羟基作为反应活性物种发挥作用，并支持催化剂的高活性。同时，它们阻碍了完全水解和溶解，从而确保催化剂在反应过程中保持稳定性。同位素标记实验证实了这些羟基的重要性，支持它们在反应途径中的作用。

总之，ODHP反应机制的多维特性，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，强调了整体反应网络的复杂性。这些协同作用对于催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义，特别是在提高选择性、增强活性和延长催化剂寿命方面。通过理解并利用这些协同作用，可以开发出更高效和耐用的催化剂用于氧化脱氢化丙烷。
