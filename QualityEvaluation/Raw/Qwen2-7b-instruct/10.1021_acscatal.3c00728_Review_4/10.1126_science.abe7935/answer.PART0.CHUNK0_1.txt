[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology."
[4] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy."
[5] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."
[6] "Further identification was performed by the 2D 11B11B proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD) homonuclear correlation spectrum."
[7] "Considering that dehydration of a portion of B[4] sites (H+[H2O]n removal) could form B[3] sites, which is a reversible and stochastic process, the B[3]B[4] spatial correlations would be inevitable if there were agglomerated boron species (e.g., BOB)."
[8] "In addition, the structure of BS-1 was investigated using gas-phase cluster analysis from the solid structure, which is bombarded from the catalyst and randomly formed to contain compositional and structural information."
[9] "Time-of-flight mass spectra (ToF-MS) showed different gas-phase clusters from the BS-1 (with metallic Cu as sample support), where the boron-containing clusters of BO2 and BO3 and a variety of borosilicate ions [SizB1OyHx, z = 1, 2] were detected."
[10] "The signals at 3.5 and 2.1 ppm should be coproduced from the hydrolysis of the SiOB linkage in zeolite framework."
[11] "Compared with as-synthesized BS-1, the used sample exhibited enhanced signal intensity at (3.5, 5.6) ppm and (2.1, 5.6) ppm."
[12] "This phenomenon is reasonably related to the further hydrolysis of SiOB bonds during the ODHP to form more spatially correlated BOH and SiOH species (e.g., isolated B[OHO(H)Si]2), which should be crucial for the high activity of BS-1 zeolite."
[13] "The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the SiOB linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere."
[14] "The kinetic parameters of B-Beta were in good agreement with those of BS-1."
[15] "In addition, even if a small amount of B(OH)3 species exists on BS-1, such a species would not contribute to propane conversion."
[16] "The first-order rate dependence might suggest a different reaction behavior on BS-1 compared with the generally supported boron and h-BN."
[17] "The catalyst framework was taken into account by the extended cluster model with isolated boron functionalized with one or two hydroxyl groups."
[18] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction."
[19] "In this case, the constructed eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds benefits the synergistic conversion of O2 (3Σg) and propane through the decreasing of energy barriers."
[20] "By contrast, the catalyst with monohydroxyl group on boron formed a weaker interaction between BOH and O2."
[21] "In the reaction over dihydroxyl group model, the intermediate (Int) was formed with a barrier (TS1) of 1.583 eV through the proton transfer from propane to BOH with C3H7 intermediate formation."
[22] "Finally, C3H6 and H2O2 were desorbed in sequence. H2O2 is an unstable intermediate at the reaction temperature, which should quickly transform into H2O and O2 in the practical reaction."
[23] "The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these reactions enhances catalyst performance by facilitating efficient activation of reactants and suppressing unwanted side reactions, such as overoxidation leading to the formation of COx. This synergy is crucial for optimizing catalysts, particularly those featuring isolated boron species in a zeolite framework, which maintain high activity and selectivity under humid conditions, thus improving water tolerance.

The active sites identified in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) consist of B[OHO(H)Si]2 structures with isolated boron species. These sites efficiently activate molecular oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation while hindering complete hydrolysis of boron species, ensuring the catalyst's robustness against water treatment and long-term testing. The isolated boron species in the zeolite framework can undergo hydrolysis to generate more B[OHO(H)Si]2 groups, which not only boosts catalytic activity but also reverses back into the SiOB linkage, demonstrating a dynamic equilibrium that supports the catalyst's durability.

The structure of BS-1 was characterized using advanced spectroscopic techniques, including 11B magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF-MS). These methods revealed the spatial arrangement of boron and hydrogen species within the zeolite framework, confirming the presence of isolated boron sites with dihydroxyl groups (B[OHO(H)Si]2) that play a critical role in the catalytic process. The kinetic parameters of the catalyst, including its first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, suggest a unique reaction mechanism that differs from conventional supported boron and hexagonal carbon nitride (h-BN) catalysts.

The reaction pathway over the BS-1 catalyst was elucidated through density functional theory calculations, which considered the influence of the zeolite framework on the reaction dynamics. The calculations demonstrated the importance of boron's dihydroxyl groups and nearby silanol species in promoting the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane, reducing energy barriers and enhancing reaction efficiency. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure further contributed to the reaction activity by stabilizing intermediate species and guiding the reaction pathways.

In summary, the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase radical reactions, facilitated by the unique structure and properties of isolated boron species in the zeolite framework, significantly enhance the performance of boron-based catalysts for ODHP. These insights provide a foundation for the rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework, and highlight the potential for scalable applications in the production of propene from shale gas, thereby reducing dependence on petroleum sources.

对BS-1催化剂的反应路径进行了密度泛函理论计算，考虑了沸石框架对反应动力学的影响。计算表明硼的两个羟基组分及其附近的硅醇基团在促进氧气和丙烷的协同转换、降低能量壁垒并增强反应效率方面的重要性。沸石微孔结构的约束效应进一步提高了反应活性，通过稳定中间物种并指导反应途径。

综上所述，表面和气相自由基反应之间的协同作用，由沸石框架内孤立硼物种的独特结构和属性增强，显著提高了硼基催化剂的ODHP性能。这些见解为设计高效脱氢催化剂提供了基础，整合硼位点到沸石框架中，并指出在从页岩天然气生产丙烯以减少石油来源依赖方面的潜在大规模应用潜力。
