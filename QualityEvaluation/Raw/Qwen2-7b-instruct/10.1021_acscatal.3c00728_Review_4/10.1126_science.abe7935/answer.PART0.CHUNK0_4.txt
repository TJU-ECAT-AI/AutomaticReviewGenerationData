[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology."
[4] "For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation (fig. S7), with Si/B ratios of 50 and 66, respectively."
[5] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C)."
[6] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A)."
[7] "Considering that dehydration of a portion of B[4] sites (H+[H2O]n removal) could form B[3] sites, which is a reversible and stochastic process, the B[3]B[4] spatial correlations would be inevitable if there were agglomerated boron species (e.g., BOB)."
[8] "In addition, the hydroxyl groups on the isolated boron were identified using NMR."
[9] "The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36)."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This highlights the complexity of the overall reaction network, where surface reactions occur on the catalyst's active sites, while gas-phase reactions involve the activation and transformation of reactants in the atmosphere above the catalyst surface. The synergistic effects between these two dimensions contribute significantly to catalyst performance and efficiency, as they enable the effective use of both the catalyst's surface area for adsorption and the gas-phase reactions for product formation.

The implications of these synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization include the potential for enhancing selectivity, improving activity, and extending the catalyst's lifetime. By understanding how the catalyst's active sites interact with reactants and products at both the surface and in the gas phase, researchers can tailor the catalyst's composition, structure, and operating conditions to maximize these interactions. This includes optimizing the coordination environment around the boron species, as demonstrated by the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the BS-1 catalyst. This structure not only facilitates the activation of oxygen and propane but also inhibits the full hydrolysis of boron species, leading to improved water tolerance and durability.

Furthermore, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the isolated boron sites plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These hydroxyl groups act as active species for the reaction, contributing to the high activity of the catalyst. Moreover, they hinder full hydrolysis and dissolution, thereby ensuring the catalyst's stability during the reaction process. The isotope-labeled experiments confirm the importance of these hydroxyl groups, supporting their role in the reaction pathway.

In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, underscores the complexity of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects between these dimensions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, particularly in terms of enhancing selectivity, improving activity, and extending catalyst lifetime. Understanding and exploiting these synergies can lead to the development of more efficient and durable catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应机制的多维特性涉及催化剂表面和气相自由基反应两个维度，这凸显了整体反应网络的复杂性。表面反应在催化剂活性位点上发生，而气相反应则涉及到大气层中反应物的激活和产物形成。这两种维度之间的协同作用对催化剂性能和优化具有重要意义，因为它们能够有效利用催化剂的表面积吸附反应物以及通过气相反应形成产品。

这些协同作用对于催化剂性能和设计优化的含义包括增强选择性、提高活性并延长催化剂寿命的可能性。通过理解催化剂活性位点如何与表面和气体中的反应物和产物相互作用，研究人员可以调整催化剂的组成、结构和操作条件，以最大化这些相互作用。这包括优化围绕硼物种的配位环境，正如BS-1催化剂中所展示的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构那样。这种结构不仅促进了氧气和丙烷的活化，而且抑制了硼物种的完全水解，从而提高了催化剂对水分的耐受性和持久性。

此外，孤立硼位点上的羟基的存在在反应机制中起着关键作用。这些羟基作为反应活性物种发挥作用，并支持催化剂的高活性。同时，它们阻碍了完全水解和溶解，从而确保催化剂在反应过程中保持稳定性。同位素标记实验证实了这些羟基的重要性，支持它们在反应途径中的作用。

总之，ODHP反应机制的多维特性，涵盖了表面和气相自由基反应，强调了整体反应网络的复杂性。这些协同作用对于催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义，特别是在提高选择性、增强活性和延长催化剂寿命方面。通过理解并利用这些协同作用，可以开发出更高效和耐用的催化剂用于氧化脱氢化丙烷。
