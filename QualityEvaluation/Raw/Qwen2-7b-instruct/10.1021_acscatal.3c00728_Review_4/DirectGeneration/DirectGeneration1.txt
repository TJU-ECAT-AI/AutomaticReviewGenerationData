The operation of organic dihydrogen phosphate (ODHP) in B-based catalysts is a complex process that unfolds across multiple dimensions, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This multidimensional nature is crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic performance and the synergistic effects that enhance the efficiency of the chemical reactions involved. The surface reactions primarily occur on the catalyst's active sites, where ODHP molecules undergo adsorption, activation, and subsequent transformations facilitated by the boron-based structure. Meanwhile, gas-phase reactions involve the interaction of radicals generated on the catalyst surface with surrounding gases, playing a significant role in the overall reaction dynamics. These gas-phase interactions can significantly influence the selectivity and yield of desired products. The integration of these surface and gas-phase processes is essential for optimizing the catalyst's activity and stability, as it allows for a more efficient conversion of reactants into products. Understanding this complex interplay not only aids in the design of more effective B-based catalysts but also opens avenues for the development of new strategies to enhance catalytic performance through the exploitation of synergistic effects between different reaction pathways.
