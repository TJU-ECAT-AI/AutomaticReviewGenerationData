[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts."
[4] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst. Based on our experimental characterizations (IR and XPS) and previous studies of boron nitride catalysts under ODHP reaction conditions, the active phase of the catalyst can be characterized as an amorphous boron oxide layer with B(OH)xO3x sites."

How does the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contribute to our understanding of the overall reaction network, and what are the implications of their synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization?

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network by revealing the dual pathways through which products are formed. The surface-mediated reactions primarily generate propene from the cleavage of propane's CH bonds, while the gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. This dual mechanism allows for a more comprehensive insight into how the catalysts operate under ODHP conditions.

The synergistic effects of these surface and gas-phase pathways have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Firstly, they suggest that the catalysts exhibit a versatile capability to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes, with the ability to selectively produce specific products based on the reaction conditions. Secondly, the identification of gas-phase methyl radicals and the confirmation of their role in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by B-based catalysts opens new avenues for optimizing catalyst design. This includes potentially enhancing the catalyst's selectivity, improving the reaction efficiency, and reducing unwanted byproducts such as COx.

Furthermore, the detailed understanding of the reaction pathways derived from the DFT calculations and experimental evidence provides a robust foundation for tailoring the catalyst's active sites to optimize the desired product distribution. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient catalysts by focusing on enhancing the surface activity for CH activation or improving the conditions for the formation of specific gas-phase radicals. Additionally, it highlights the importance of considering both surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions in the design of B-based catalysts for ODHP, aiming to maximize the yield of desired products and minimize energy consumption and environmental impact.

ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上的多维特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，极大地丰富了我们对整体反应网络的理解。这种多维度特性通过揭示产物形成过程中的双路径，为我们提供了深入理解催化剂操作方式的新视角。表面介导的反应主要通过丙烷的CH键断裂产生丙烯，而气相反应则通过表面介导和气相途径共同贡献于C1和C2产品的形成。这种双重机制允许对催化剂在ODHP条件下的运行有更全面的洞察。

这些表面和气相路径的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化具有深远的影响。首先，它们表明催化剂具有灵活的能力，能够高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃，并根据反应条件选择性地生成特定产品。其次，识别气相甲基自由基并确认其在B基催化剂上催化ODHP反应中的作用，为优化催化剂设计开辟了新途径。这包括可能增强催化剂的选择性、提高反应效率以及减少如COx等副产品的产生。

此外，从密度泛函理论计算和实验证据中得出的详细反应路径提供了坚实的基础，用于调整催化剂的活性位点以优化所需产品的分布。这可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，通过着重增强表面活性以促进CH激活或改善特定气相自由基形成的条件来实现。此外，它强调了在设计B基催化剂时同时考虑表面化学和气相相互作用的重要性，旨在最大化目标产物的产率并降低能耗和环境影响。
