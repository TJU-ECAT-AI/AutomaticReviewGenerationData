The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by revealing a complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes. This synergy implies that the reaction proceeds through multiple pathways, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts. The identification of gas-phase methyl radicals provides direct evidence for the involvement of radical chemistry in the ODHP reaction, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts. The coupling of kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations enables the proposal of detailed reaction pathways for various products, highlighting the role of surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions in the formation of propene and C1/C2 products. This understanding is crucial for the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.
