[1] "The ODHP reaction catalyzed by both h-BN and supported boron oxide catalysts involves the gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways with unambiguously identified gas-phase methyl radicals by using the SVUV-PIMS."
[2] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts."
[3] "Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual pathway approach reveals that propene formation primarily occurs through surface reactions, specifically the cleavage of CH bonds in propane. Simultaneously, C1 and C2 products are generated via both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions. The synergy between these pathways implies that optimizing catalyst performance and design requires careful consideration of both surface and gas-phase interactions. This insight is crucial for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation, enhancing efficiency and selectivity in the production of valuable olefins.
