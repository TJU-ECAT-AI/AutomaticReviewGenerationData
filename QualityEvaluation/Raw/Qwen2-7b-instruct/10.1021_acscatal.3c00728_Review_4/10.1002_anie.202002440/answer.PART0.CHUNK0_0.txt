[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual pathway approach allows for a comprehensive view of how different products are formed, providing insights into the synergistic effects between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions. These insights are crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they suggest that enhancing either pathway could potentially improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process. The coupling of kinetic studies, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations enables a detailed understanding of the reaction pathways, leading to the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.
