[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
[5] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual pathway approach allows for the formation of propene primarily through surface reactions involving the cleavage of CH bonds in propane. Simultaneously, C1 and C2 products can emerge from both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions. The synergy between these pathways enhances catalyst performance and provides a basis for optimizing catalyst design by considering both surface and gas-phase interactions. This insight is crucial for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维度特性，包括表面和气体相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解起到了重要作用。这种双路径方法允许丙烯主要通过表面反应产生，涉及丙烷中CH键的断裂。同时，C1和C2产物可以从表面介导和气体相反应中形成。这两种途径的协同作用提高了催化剂性能，并为优化催化剂设计提供了基础，考虑了表面和气体相交互作用。这些见解对于开发高度选择性的烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂至关重要。
