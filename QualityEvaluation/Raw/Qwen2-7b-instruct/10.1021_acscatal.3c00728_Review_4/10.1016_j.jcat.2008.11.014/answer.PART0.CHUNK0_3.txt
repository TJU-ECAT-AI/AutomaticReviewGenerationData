<p>The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study</p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function.</p>
<p>At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species.</p>
<p>Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.</p>
<p>Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr).</p>

The study aimed to provide insights into the nature and distribution of chromium species in catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It was found that at 1 wt% chromium loading, SBA-15 supports predominantly isolated chromium(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, whereas γ-Al2O3 supports a mix of oligomers including dimers along with isolated species. γ-Al2O3 predominantly supports oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species, with no Cr2O3 particles detected. Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those with exclusively isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) showed higher activity and selectivity compared to those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). Isolated Cr species on SBA-15 exhibited higher intrinsic activity than those on γ-Al2O3. For xCrAl2O3, catalysts with predominantly oligomeric species demonstrated the highest activity, highlighting the crucial role of these species in the reaction.

该研究旨在为丙烷脱氢催化剂中的铬物种的性质和分布提供新的见解。研究发现，在1 wt%的铬负载下，SBA-15主要支持孤立的铬(VI)物种在四面体配位中，而γ-Al2O3则支持混合的寡聚物，包括二聚体，以及孤立的物种。γ-Al2O3主要支持具有不同核度的寡聚物以及一小部分孤立物种，并未检测到Cr2O3粒子。在xCrSBA-15催化剂中，仅含孤立Cr物种（1 wt% Cr）的催化剂显示出与Cr负载相比更高的活性和选择性。SBA-15上的孤立Cr物种的内在活性高于γ-Al2O3。对于xCrAl2O3，主要由寡聚物组成的催化剂显示出最高的活性，这强调了这些物种在反应中的关键作用。
