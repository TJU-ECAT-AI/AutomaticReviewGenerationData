The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the importance of both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. These reactions work synergistically, influencing catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species on SBA-15, with tetrahedral coordination, and oligomers on γ-Al2O3, with different degrees of nuclearity, are key factors. The isolated Cr species on SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 exhibit distinct activities and stabilities, with SBA-15 showing higher activity and selectivity for DHP compared to γ-Al2O3. The presence of crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles on SBA-15 and the absence of Cr2O3 particles on γ-Al2O3 are crucial in determining the catalytic activity. Isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are found to be more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Oligomeric Cr species on γ-Al2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr species, indicating that the nature and distribution of Cr species significantly impact the catalytic performance.

ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上的多维性质对整体反应网络的理解至关重要，强调了表面反应和气体相自由基反应的协同作用。这些反应相互影响，共同决定了催化剂性能和设计优化。具体来说，SBA-15上仅存在的孤立的Cr(VI)物种（四面体配位）和γ-Al2O3上存在的不同核度的寡聚物是关键因素。SBA-15上的孤立Cr物种和γ-Al2O3表现出不同的活性和稳定性，其中SBA-15在DHP方面的活性和选择性高于γ-Al2O3。SBA-15上存在晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒，而γ-Al2O3上不存在Cr2O3颗粒，这是确定催化活性的关键。SBA-15上的孤立Cr(III)物种与结晶Cr2O3表面的Cr物种相比，协调数大于四时，显示出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。γ-Al2O3上的寡聚Cr物种比孤立的Cr物种更活跃和选择性，表明Cr物种的性质和分布显著影响催化性能。

The study aimed to provide insights into the nature and distribution of chromium species in catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It was found that at 1 wt% chromium loading, SBA-15 supports predominantly isolated chromium(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, whereas γ-Al2O3 supports a mix of oligomers including dimers along with isolated species. γ-Al2O3 predominantly supports oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species, with no Cr2O3 particles detected. Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those with exclusively isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) showed higher activity and selectivity compared to those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr).

The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

All these characterization techniques indicate that, at 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species. At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.

Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr).

Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction.

In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.
