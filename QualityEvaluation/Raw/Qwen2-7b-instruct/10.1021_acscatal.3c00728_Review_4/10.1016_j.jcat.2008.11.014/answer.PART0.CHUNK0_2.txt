[1] "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."
[2] "Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."
[3] "Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr)."
[4] "In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."
[5] "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3."
[6] "In xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites."
[7] "From this it also appears that the rearrangement of Cr species in oligomers compared to that in crystals has a greater influence on the catalytic property."
