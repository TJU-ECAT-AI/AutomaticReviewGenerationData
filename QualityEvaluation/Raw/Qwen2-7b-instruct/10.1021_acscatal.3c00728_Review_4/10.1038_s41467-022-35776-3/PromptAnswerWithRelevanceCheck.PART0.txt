[1] "During the ODH reaction catalyzed by h-BN, the in-situ formed olefins, which were generally considered chemically inert in boron-based catalytic systems17,23,24, played a crucial role in promoting parent alkane conversion and cracking of C-C bonds."
[2] "We conducted a series of characterizations to investigate the state of catalysts before and after ODH reaction under different atmospheres."
[3] "The synergistic effect between alkane and olefin in co-feeding atmosphere was evaluated through catalytic tests with various pC2H6/pC3H6 (the ratio of partial pressure of ethane to partial pressure of propylene)."
[4] "The key species in the ODH reaction system were illustrated through temperature-programmed experiments with C2H6C3H6 feeding mode."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the intricate pathways and mechanisms that govern the transformation of reactants into products. This includes the identification of key intermediates, such as hydroperoxyl and alkoxyl radicals, and their interactions with olefins. The synergistic effects of these reactions are crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and design. For instance, the presence of olefins accelerates the conversion of parent alkanes and promotes the cracking of C-C bonds, enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic process. This understanding allows for the development of strategies that leverage these synergies, such as the co-feeding of alkane and olefin mixtures, to achieve higher conversion rates at lower temperatures. The characterization of catalyst states and the evaluation of reaction dynamics through various experimental techniques provide insights into the stability and reactivity of the catalyst under different conditions, further aiding in the optimization of reaction parameters for improved performance.
