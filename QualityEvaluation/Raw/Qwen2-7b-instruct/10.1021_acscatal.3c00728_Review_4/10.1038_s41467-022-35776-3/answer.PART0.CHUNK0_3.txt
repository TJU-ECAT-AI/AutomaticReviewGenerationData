[1] "The in-situ formed olefins played a vital role in accelerating the conversion of parent alkanes in the ODH reaction over BN catalysts."
[2] "The isotope tracer studies reveal the cleavage of C-C bond in propylene when co-existing with propane, directly evidencing the deep-oxidation of olefins occur in the ODH reaction over BN."
[3] "This unusual observation motivated us to assume that olefins generated from propane could trigger the CH bond activation of ethane at a lower temperature."
[4] "The synergistic effect of the two hydrocarbons occurred in the gas-phase and was enhanced by BN."
[5] "The in-situ formed olefins were the most likely products to enhance the oxidation of alkane."
[6] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels."
[7] "The presence of propane promoted the generation of CO, reducing the selectivity of ethylene."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface-mediated radical formation and gas-phase reactions. This synergy leads to the generation of reactive intermediates that can accelerate alkane conversion and olefin formation. The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant, as it suggests that by carefully controlling the composition of the reaction mixture and the reaction conditions, one can maximize the efficiency of alkane conversion and olefin selectivity. This understanding can guide the development of more effective catalysts and reaction pathways tailored to specific industrial needs, potentially leading to more environmentally friendly and economically viable olefin production methods.
