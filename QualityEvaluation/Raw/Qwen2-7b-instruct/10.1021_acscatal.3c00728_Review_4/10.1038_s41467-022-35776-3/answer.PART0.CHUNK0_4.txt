1. The tandem reaction system involving two fixed bed reactors (R1 and R2) utilizes the exhaust from R1, which contains residual reactants and nascent products from the ODH reaction, to enhance alkane conversion in R2.

2. In the co-feeding process, one gas acts as the main reactant (CH4, C2H6, or C3H8) while the other introduces olefins (C2H4, C3H6, CO, or CO2) at a lower flow rate, demonstrating the synergy between alkane and olefin.

3. Olefins generated in situ are identified as key factors in accelerating the oxidation of alkane during the ODH reaction.

4. By co-feeding propane and ethane, the temperature requirement for ethane activation is reduced by approximately 35°C compared to ethane single-feed conditions.

5. At 530°C, the conversion of ethane reaches 13.0% with an ethylene productivity of 0.90 gC2H4 gcat<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, showcasing a fivefold increase over ethane single-feed conditions.

6. Supplementary Fig. 31 illustrates the selectivity of ethane-derived ethylene in relation to ethane conversion across the two feeding modes.

7. In the cyclic experiments, propylene exhibited a faster change in alkane conversion compared to water, highlighting differences in their impact on alkane activation routes.

1. 双固定床反应器（R1和R2）串联系统中，R1排放物含有剩余反应物（C3H8和O2）以及新生ODH产物（C3H6、C2H4、CO和CO2），被用于在R2反应器中增强烷烃转化。

2. 在共供气过程中，一种气体作为主要反应物（CH4、C2H6或C3H8）提供，另一种引入烯烃（C2H4、C3H6、CO或CO2），流量较低，显示出烷烃与烯烃之间的协同作用。

3. 生成的烯烃被确认为加速烷烃氧化的关键因素，在ODH反应中。

4. 通过共供丙烷和乙烷，乙烷激活所需的温度比单一乙烷供气条件下降低了约35°C。

5. 在530°C下，乙烷的转化率达到13.0%，乙烷产物的产率为0.90 gC2H4 gcat<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>，相比于单一乙烷供气条件，显示了近五倍的增加。

6. 补充图31展示了两种供气模式下乙烷衍生乙烷的选型与乙烷转化率的关系。

7. 在循环实验中，丙烯表现出比水更快的烷烃转化变化，突出了它们在烷烃激活途径中的不同影响。
