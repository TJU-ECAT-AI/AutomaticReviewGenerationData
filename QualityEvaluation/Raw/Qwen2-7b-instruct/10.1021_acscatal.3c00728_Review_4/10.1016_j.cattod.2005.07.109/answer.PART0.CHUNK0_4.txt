[1] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand."
[2] "Currently, about 70% of propylene worldwide production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and 2% from specific on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis and others."
[3] "Although capacity of propylene on-purpose processes is going to be quadrupled in the next 5 years, it will still cover only a small part of the propylene demand, and other sources have to be developed."
[4] "It is well known that increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units. Likewise, propylene production may be increased by using olefins selective catalysts or by incorporating ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives into the catalytic system."
[5] "With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced, which would facilitate downstream upgrading."
[6] "Experiments were carried out over a mixture of 95 wt.% of a commercial low rare earth Y zeolite-based catalyst and 5 wt.% of ZSM-5 zeolite-based additive, using light FCC naphtha (LCN) and vacuum gas oil as feeds."
[7] "Conversion is defined as the sum of dry gas, LPG and coke when cracking naphtha. In the case of simultaneous cracking of gas oil and naphtha, conversion is defined as the sum of liquid products boiling below 489 K, gases and coke."
[8] "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
[9] "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
[10] "Notice that site density may be decreased either by dealumination (irreversible) or coking (reversible) of the catalyst."
[11] "As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins."
[12] "Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular)."
[13] "The balance between mono- and bimolecular mechanism will depend on the surface coverage by carbenium ion."
[14] "This second mechanism explains the formation of heavier compounds than those present in the feed, as well as and the hydrogen-transfer reaction."
[15] "Finally, the carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, thus, restoring the initial active site."
[16] "Notice that site density may be decreased either by dealumination (irreversible) or coking (reversible) of the catalyst."
[17] "At high temperature (923 K), the high propylene yield and the decrease of all paraffin yields indicate that cracking is the predominant reaction."
[18] "The same conversion towards gas and coke can be reached using a lower space velocity in a fixed bed (LCN 5), but the selectivity is different than those encountered with regenerated catalyst and transported bed."
[19] "Paraffinic gasoline yield is lower and light olefins yield is higher with coke-on-catalyst, which clearly demonstrates that it reduces the ratio of hydrogen-transfer reaction rate over cracking reaction rate."
[20] "This can be achieved in two ways. The Y zeolite may be more deactivated than the ZSM5 zeolite, thus, favoring the conversion of the LCN on this late, more selective to cracking."
[21] "Also, the coke may decrease the site density on Y zeolite, which will decrease the reaction rate for bimolecular reactions like hydrogen transfer."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. These reactions involve the generation of surface carbenium ions through addition of a proton on a double bond or a saturated molecule, followed by cracking to produce a carbenium ion and a paraffin. The carbenium ion can then undergo further reactions, including cracking into olefins and hydrogen transfer, leading to the formation of heavier compounds. The balance between monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms depends on the surface coverage by carbenium ions, which can be influenced by factors such as site density and temperature. Site density can be decreased through irreversible dealumination or reversible coking of the catalyst. The hydrogen-transfer reaction plays a crucial role in the transformation of olefins and naphthenes into heavier compounds. The overall reaction network of the ODHP mechanism exhibits synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions, contributing to enhanced catalyst performance and optimized design. The implications of these synergistic effects include improved selectivity, increased propylene production, and reduced olefin content in the FCC naphtha.
