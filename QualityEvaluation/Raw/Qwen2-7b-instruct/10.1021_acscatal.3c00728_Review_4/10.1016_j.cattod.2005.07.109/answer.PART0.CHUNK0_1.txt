[1] "Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units."
[2] "With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced."
[3] "Thus, parameters, such as site density or temperature will have an influence on the cracking probability."
[4] "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
[5] "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
[6] "As shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that at moderate temperature (723 and 823 K, transported bed), the hydrogen-transfer ability of the Y zeolite is the governing reaction."
[7] "The major operational drawback of this operation would be the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics. This understanding reveals how the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions optimize catalyst performance and enable design optimizations aimed at enhancing selectivity and efficiency. For instance, the mechanism demonstrates that the reactivity of olefins is notably higher than that of paraffins under FCC cracking conditions, which influences the direction of the reaction towards propylene production. Moreover, the reactivity of shorter-chain olefins is lower compared to longer-chain olefins, affecting the yield and selectivity of olefins and naphthenes conversion. These insights into the reaction kinetics and mechanisms guide the development of more effective catalysts and processing strategies for optimizing propylene yield in FCC units.
