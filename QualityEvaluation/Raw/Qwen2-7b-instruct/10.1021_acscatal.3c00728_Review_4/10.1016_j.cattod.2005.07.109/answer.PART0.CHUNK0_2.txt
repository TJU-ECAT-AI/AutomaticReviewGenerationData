It is well known that increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units. Likewise, propylene production may be increased by using olefins selective catalysts or by incorporating ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives into the catalytic system. Yet another emerging option to increase propylene yield is by reprocessing FCC naphtha. With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced, which would facilitate downstream upgrading.

Answer: The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. These synergistic effects enhance catalyst performance and enable optimization for enhanced propylene yield and selectivity.
