3.1. Reactions governing the cracking of naphtha
It has been well established that the conversion of light hydrocarbons occurs via carbenium ion chemistry. First, a carbenium ion is generated, either by addition of a proton on a double bond or by the addition of a proton on a saturated molecule, forming a pentacoordinated ion, which immediately cracks yielding a carbenium ion and a paraffin [12] . Then, the carbenium ion cracks yielding olefins and a smaller carbenium ion (monomolecular mechanism) or acts as an active site by reacting with a feed molecule (bimolecular mechanism) forming a larger molecule that further cracks. This second mechanism explains the formation of heavier compounds than those present in the feed, as well as and the hydrogen-transfer reaction [13] . Finally, the carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, thus, restoring the initial active site. This mechanism, called chain mechanism, has been useful to explain the conversion of small paraffins [14] ,[15] and can be applied in the same way to the conversion of the other classes of hydrocarbons present in the naphtha feed, with the difference that, for olefins, the carbenium ion generation is much easier. The balance between mono- and bimolecular mechanism will depend on the surface coverage by carbenium ion. Thus, parameters, such as site density or temperature will have an influence on the cracking probability. Notice that site density may be decreased either by dealumination (irreversible) or coking (reversible) of the catalyst. On the other hand, a small pore size will favour the monomolecular mechanism since the bimolecular reaction intermediary cannot be formed in narrow pores, which was observed with the conversion of C5C9 olefins on ZSM5 zeolite [16] . As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins. Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular). This second step can lead to a paraffin together with a more dehydrogenated carbenium ion (hydrogen transfer) or form a C10C14 carbenium ion that can then cycle and lead after cracking and dehydrogenation to a C7C11 aromatic and a corresponding amount of hydrogen or paraffins (dimerization-cracking).

Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown [19] that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation. Thus, a bimolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to the formation of aromatics from the naphthenes, since the carbenium may be directly formed from the feed molecule through a hydride transfer, while a monomolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to short olefins. Then, the balance between hydrogen-transfer reactions and cracking reactions will be critical in orienting the selectivity of olefins and naphthenes conversion towards either propylene or gasoline-range aromatics and paraffins.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interplay between carbenium ion chemistry, hydrogen-transfer reactions, and cracking mechanisms. The synergistic effects of these reactions on catalyst performance and design optimization are crucial. Specifically, the balance between monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms, influenced by factors such as site density and temperature, affects cracking probability. Dealumination and coking of the catalyst can alter site density, impacting reaction rates. Additionally, the small pore size preference for the monomolecular mechanism indicates that catalyst pore architecture plays a role in determining reaction pathways. These insights highlight the importance of considering multiple reaction pathways simultaneously to optimize catalyst performance. For instance, the conversion of naphtha range olefins follows a chain mechanism, where olefins can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins or react with an existing carbenium ion, leading to hydrogen transfer or aromatic formation. Naphthenes, on the other hand, preferentially undergo hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation, favoring aromatic products. Balancing hydrogen-transfer reactions with cracking reactions is essential for controlling the selectivity of olefins and naphthenes toward propylene or gasoline-range products, demonstrating the complexity and multidimensionality of the ODHP process over B-based catalysts.

多维度的ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上的表面和气相自由基反应，通过阐明碳正离子化学、氢转移反应和裂解机制之间的复杂相互作用，有助于我们理解整体反应网络。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化至关重要。具体而言，单分子和双分子机制之间的平衡，受因素如位点密度和温度的影响，影响裂解概率。催化剂的去铝化和焦炭沉积可以改变位点密度，从而影响反应速率。此外，小孔径偏好单分子机制，表明催化剂孔隙结构决定了反应路径。这些见解强调同时考虑多个反应途径的重要性以优化催化剂性能。例如，naphtha范围的烯烃遵循链机制，其中烯烃可以生成一个碳正离子并裂解成LPG范围的烯烃，或者与现有的碳正离子反应，导致氢转移或芳香族形成。另一方面，naphthenes倾向于通过氢转移反应或直接脱氢形成芳香族产品，这有利于芳香族产品的形成。平衡氢转移反应与裂解反应对于控制烯烃和naphthenes向丙烯或汽油范围产物的选择性至关重要，这说明了ODHP过程在B基催化剂上的复杂性和多维性。
