[1] "It has been well established that the conversion of light hydrocarbons occurs via carbenium ion chemistry."
[2] "First, a carbenium ion is generated, either by addition of a proton on a double bond or by the addition of a proton on a saturated molecule, forming a pentacoordinated ion, which immediately cracks yielding a carbenium ion and a paraffin."
[3] "Then, the carbenium ion cracks yielding olefins and a smaller carbenium ion (monomolecular mechanism) or acts as an active site by reacting with a feed molecule (bimolecular mechanism) forming a larger molecule that further cracks."
[4] "Finally, the carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, thus, restoring the initial active site."
[5] "This mechanism, called chain mechanism, has been useful to explain the conversion of small paraffins."
[6] "As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins."
[7] "Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular)."
[8] "This second step can lead to a paraffin together with a more dehydrogenated carbenium ion (hydrogen transfer) or form a C10C14 carbenium ion that can then cycle and lead after cracking and dehydrogenation to a C7C11 aromatic and a corresponding amount of hydrogen or paraffins (dimerization-cracking)."
[9] "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
[10] "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
[11] "Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation."
[12] "Thus, a bimolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to the formation of aromatics from the naphthenes, since the carbenium may be directly formed from the feed molecule through a hydride transfer, while a monomolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to short olefins."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by detailing the pathways and mechanisms through which various hydrocarbons undergo conversion. The synergistic effects of these mechanisms imply that the performance of B-based catalysts can be optimized by controlling factors such as temperature, catalyst composition, and feedstock characteristics. This detailed understanding allows for the design of catalysts and reaction conditions that enhance the efficiency of the conversion process, particularly in terms of propylene yield. The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization include the ability to tailor the reaction network to maximize the production of desired products, such as propylene, while minimizing unwanted side reactions and waste products. This leads to enhanced selectivity and productivity in the overall process, potentially enabling significant improvements in the economics and environmental impact of petrochemical manufacturing.
