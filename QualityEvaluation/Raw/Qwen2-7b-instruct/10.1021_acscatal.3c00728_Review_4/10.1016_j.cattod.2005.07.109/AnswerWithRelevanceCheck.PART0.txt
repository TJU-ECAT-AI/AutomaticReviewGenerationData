          "Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units."
          "With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced."
          "Thus, parameters, such as site density or temperature will have an influence on the cracking probability."
          "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
          "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
          "As shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that at moderate temperature (723 and 823 K, transported bed), the hydrogen-transfer ability of the Y zeolite is the governing reaction."
          "The major operational drawback of this operation would be the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes to understanding the overall reaction network by highlighting the role of surface and gas-phase reactions in influencing the probability of cracking. The reactivity of olefins relative to paraffins under realistic conditions, along with the impact of parameters such as site density and temperature, plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of B-based catalysts and enhancing propylene yield. The ability of certain catalysts, like Y zeolite, to govern hydrogen-transfer reactions under specific conditions also provides insights into optimizing the reaction network. However, the operation faces a major drawback in the substantial increase in dry gas yield due to thermal cracking.

          在基于B的催化剂上的ODHP反应机制的多维特性，通过强调表面和气相反应在影响裂解概率方面的作用，有助于理解整体反应网络。在现实条件下，烯烃相对于烷烃的高反应性，以及参数如位点密度和温度的影响，在优化B型催化剂性能和提高丙烯产量方面起着关键作用。某些催化剂（如Y沸石）在特定条件下主导氢转移反应的能力也提供了优化反应网络的见解。然而，该操作面临的主要问题是由于热裂解导致的干气产量大幅增加。

          "It has been well established that the conversion of light hydrocarbons occurs via carbenium ion chemistry."
          "First, a carbenium ion is generated, either by addition of a proton on a double bond or by the addition of a proton on a saturated molecule, forming a pentacoordinated ion, which immediately cracks yielding a carbenium ion and a paraffin."
          "Then, the carbenium ion cracks yielding olefins and a smaller carbenium ion (monomolecular mechanism) or acts as an active site by reacting with a feed molecule (bimolecular mechanism) forming a larger molecule that further cracks."
          "Finally, the carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, thus, restoring the initial active site."
          "This mechanism, called chain mechanism, has been useful to explain the conversion of small paraffins."
          "As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins."
          "Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular)."
          "This second step can lead to a paraffin together with a more dehydrogenated carbenium ion (hydrogen transfer) or form a C10C14 carbenium ion that can then cycle and lead after cracking and dehydrogenation to a C7C11 aromatic and a corresponding amount of hydrogen or paraffins (dimerization-cracking)."
          "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
          "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
          "Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation."
          "Thus, a bimolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to the formation of aromatics from the naphthenes, since the carbenium may be directly formed from the feed molecule through a hydride transfer, while a monomolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to short olefins."

          The ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. It explains the conversion of light hydrocarbons through carbenium ion chemistry, starting with the generation of a carbenium ion by adding a proton to a double bond or a saturated molecule, leading to immediate cracking and the formation of a paraffin. Subsequent reactions, including monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms, involve the cracking of the carbenium ion into olefins and smaller carbenium ions, or acting as an active site by reacting with a feed molecule to form larger molecules that further crack. The carbenium ion can desorb as an olefin, restoring the initial active site. This chain mechanism is useful in explaining the conversion of small paraffins. The mechanism also accounts for the preferential cracking of naphthenes into smaller olefins and the formation of aromatics from methylcyclohexene through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation. The balance between monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms is influenced by factors such as site density and temperature, affecting the probability of cracking.

          在基于B的催化剂上的ODHP反应机制包含了表面和气相自由基反应。它通过碳正离子化学解释了轻烃的转换，从在双键或饱和分子上添加质子生成碳正离子开始，导致立即裂解和形成烷烃。后续反应包括单分子和双分子机制，涉及碳正离子裂解成烯烃和较小的碳正离子，或作为活性中心通过与馈料分子反应形成进一步裂解的较大分子。碳正离子可以作为烯烃脱附，恢复初始活性中心。这种链机制在解释小烷烃的转换方面很有用。该机制还考虑了naphthenes的优先裂解成较小的烯烃以及通过氢转移反应或直接脱氢从methylcyclohexene形成芳香族的机制。单分子和双分子机制之间的平衡受到位点密度和温度等因素的影响，影响裂解的概率。
