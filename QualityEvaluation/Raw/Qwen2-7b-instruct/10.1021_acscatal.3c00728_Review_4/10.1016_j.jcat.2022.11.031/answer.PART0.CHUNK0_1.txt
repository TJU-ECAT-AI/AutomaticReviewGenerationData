<p>Boron-containing zeolites have been proven potential in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process and the boron sites in open coordination are considered as the active center.</p>
<p>By considering the diversity and adjustability in the crystal structure of zeolite, there is a great opportunity to further tune the activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>An 20 % improvement in propylene selectivity is achieved at propane conversion of 21.5 % at 540 C, with propylene productivity nearly an order of magnitude higher compared with crystalline MFI-type borosilicate zeolite.</p>
<p>Combined with kinetic measurements, the reaction in the gas phase initiated by the active boron sites is mainly responsible for the high catalytic performance in ODH of propane reaction.</p>
<p>The designed experiment indicates the strengthened gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in the increase of reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30.</p>

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual approach allows for a more comprehensive exploration of reaction pathways and their interactions, leading to insights into how these pathways influence catalyst performance and design optimization. The synergistic effects of these reactions enhance the efficiency of the catalytic process, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity and productivity. By identifying the active boron sites responsible for initiating reactions in the gas phase, researchers can tailor catalyst structures to maximize the contribution of gas-phase reactions, thereby boosting the activation of reactants and increasing the reaction order. This synergy not only improves the selectivity for propylene but also optimizes the catalytic performance of B-based catalysts, providing a new direction for the development of highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP process.
