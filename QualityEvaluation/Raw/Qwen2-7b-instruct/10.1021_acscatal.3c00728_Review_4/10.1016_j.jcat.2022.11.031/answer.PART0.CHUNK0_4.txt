Herein, the embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) was prepared and used for investigating the ODHP reaction. Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction.
Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size. The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites.
In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these two pathways implies that enhancing one can boost the performance of the other, leading to a more efficient catalyst. The implications of their synergistic effects are profound for catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the presence of H-bonded BOH groups in defect-rich borosilicate zeolites facilitates the activation of propane both on the surface and in the gas phase. This dual activation mechanism, combined with the large microporosity of embryonic borosilicate zeolites, enhances mass transfer and improves the accessibility of active sites. Consequently, the catalysts can achieve higher reaction rates and selectivities, particularly for propylene production, through optimized surface and gas-phase reactions.

多维度的ODHP反应机制，包括表面和气体相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解有着重要意义。这两种路径之间的协同作用表明，增强一种可以提升另一种的性能，从而实现催化剂的高效性。它们协同效应的含义对于催化剂性能和设计优化具有深远影响。具体来说，在缺陷丰富的硼硅酸盐沸石中，通过氢键连接的BOH基团在表面和气体相中促进丙烷的活化。这种双激活机制，结合了胚胎型硼硅酸盐沸石的大微孔结构，提高了物质传递效率并改善了活性位点的可接近性。因此，通过优化表面和气体相反应，催化剂能够实现更高的反应速率和选择性，特别是丙烯的生产。
