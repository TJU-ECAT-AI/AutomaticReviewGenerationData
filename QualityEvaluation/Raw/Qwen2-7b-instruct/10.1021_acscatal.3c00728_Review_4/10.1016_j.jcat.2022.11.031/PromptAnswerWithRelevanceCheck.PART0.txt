Herein, the embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) was prepared and used for investigating the ODHP reaction. Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction.
In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these two pathways imply that optimizing the balance between surface reactions and gas-phase reactions can enhance catalyst performance. Specifically, the presence of highly exposed active boron centers and the enhancement of gas-phase reactions are crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This synergy suggests that catalyst design should focus on creating conditions that facilitate both efficient surface activation of propane and effective gas-phase reactions to maximize the yield of propylene.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual approach allows for a more comprehensive exploration of reaction pathways and their interactions, leading to insights into how these pathways influence catalyst performance and design optimization. The synergistic effects of these reactions enhance the efficiency of the catalytic process, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity and productivity. By identifying the active boron sites responsible for initiating reactions in the gas phase, researchers can tailor catalyst structures to maximize the contribution of gas-phase reactions, thereby boosting the activation of reactants and increasing the reaction order. This synergy not only improves the selectivity for propylene but also optimizes the catalytic performance of B-based catalysts, providing a new direction for the development of highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP process.
