The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions lead to enhanced catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the formation of boron sites in open coordination derived from the defect-rich structure of embryonic borosilicate zeolite ensures ample exposure of the active center. Kinetic measurements reveal that the reaction in the gas phase initiated by these active boron sites is crucial for the high catalytic performance in ODH of propane. The strengthened gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, increasing the reaction order of propane. This results in improved catalytic performance, particularly in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity, compared to traditional MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalysts.

ODHP反应机制中，基于硼基催化剂的多维特性，包括表面和气体相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解至关重要。这两种反应的协同作用促进了催化剂性能的提升和设计优化。具体来说，从胚胎型硼硅酸盐沸石的缺陷丰富的结构中形成的硼位点确保了活性中心的充分暴露。动力学测量表明，由这些活性硼位点引发的气相反应对于丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的高催化性能至关重要。加强的气相反应有助于丙烷的活化，从而增加丙烷的反应级数。这导致了增强的催化性能，特别是在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面，与传统的MFI型硼硅酸盐沸石催化剂相比。
