Herein, the embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) was prepared and used for investigating the ODHP reaction. Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction.
In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these two pathways imply that optimizing the balance between surface reactions and gas-phase reactions can enhance catalyst performance. Specifically, the presence of highly exposed active boron centers and the enhancement of gas-phase reactions are crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This synergy suggests that catalyst design should focus on creating conditions that facilitate both efficient surface activation of propane and effective gas-phase reactions to maximize the yield of propylene.

多维性质的ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上，既包括表面反应也包括气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解至关重要。这两条路径的协同效应表明，优化表面反应和气相反应之间的平衡可以提高催化剂性能。具体来说，高暴露活性硼中心的存在和增强的气相反应对于实现丙烷氧化脱氢的高效性至关重要。这种协同作用暗示，在设计催化剂时，应着重于创造既能有效激活表面丙烷又能高效进行气相反应的条件，以最大化丙烯的产率。
