[1] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."
[2] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."
[3] "In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts."
[4] "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane."
[5] "It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions imply that enhancing the accessibility of active sites and improving mass transfer can lead to optimized catalyst performance. Specifically, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and the enhancement of gas-phase reactions are feasible strategies for developing highly active and selective ODHP catalysts. This synergy facilitates the activation of propane, increasing the reaction order and enabling improved catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
