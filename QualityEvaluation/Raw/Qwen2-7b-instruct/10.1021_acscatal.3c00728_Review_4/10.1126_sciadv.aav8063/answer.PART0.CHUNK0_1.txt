Answer: The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions has profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as it allows for a more comprehensive view of the reaction pathways and intermediates involved. By considering these dual aspects, researchers can better tailor catalysts to enhance selectivity, efficiency, and stability, leading to improved product yields and reduced environmental impact.
