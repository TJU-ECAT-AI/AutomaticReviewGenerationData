Answer: The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by revealing the intricate interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics. This synergy facilitates a more comprehensive insight into how these processes interact, affecting product selectivity, yield, and reaction kinetics. The implications of these synergistic effects on catalyst performance and design optimization are profound, as they enable the development of catalysts with enhanced activity, stability, and efficiency. By elucidating the roles of both surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can tailor catalysts to maximize desired outcomes, such as increasing the formation of high-value products while minimizing byproducts.
