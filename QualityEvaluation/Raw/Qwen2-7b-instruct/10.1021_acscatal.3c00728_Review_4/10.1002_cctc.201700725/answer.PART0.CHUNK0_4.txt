[1] "Our observations with operando spectroscopy offered important messages towards the understanding of the ODH reaction and the rational design of catalysts, particularly those of the nonmetal category: O2 adsorption but not dissociation is key to a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction."
[2] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."
[3] "In such a case, O2 only comes into play for the preliminary activation toward the edges of BN to form BOH active sites."
[4] "Likewise, kinetic measurements with ethylene as a reactant show that the consumption of gaseous O2 (O2 order=0.57) is indispensable for ethylene conversion."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These mechanisms highlight the importance of O2 adsorption but not dissociation for a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction. Specifically, the active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, facilitating the dehydrogenation of ethane. The presence of ethane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN, leading to the formation of BO sites. These BO sites abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2, ultimately completing the dehydrogenation cycle. The synergistic effects of these surface and gas-phase reactions are crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and design. Kinetic measurements confirm that the consumption of gaseous O2 is indispensable for ethylene conversion, underscoring the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in this reaction.

多维的ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解提供了重要的见解。这些机制强调了吸附O2而不是解离对于无燃烧石蜡ODHP反应的关键性。具体而言，BO(H)活性位点在BN边缘由乙烷的辅助形成，促进了乙烷的脱氢作用。乙烷能够促进吸附于BN边缘的O2的初步激活，形成BO位点。这些BO位点通过O2的帮助从乙烷中提取氢原子，最终完成脱氢循环。表面化学与气相动力学之间的这种协同作用对于优化催化剂性能和设计至关重要。动力学测量证实了气体态O2的消耗对于乙烯转化是必不可少的，这凸显了表面化学和气相动力学之间复杂相互作用在这一反应中的重要性。
