[1] "Our observations with operando spectroscopy offered important messages towards the understanding of the ODH reaction and the rational design of catalysts, particularly those of the nonmetal category: O2 adsorption but not dissociation is key to a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction."
[2] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions is crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, O2 adsorption without dissociation enables a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction. Active BO(H) sites are formed at the BN edges with the aid of ethane, allowing for the efficient abstraction of a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2. These findings offer insights into the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, guiding the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkanes' oxidative dehydrogenation.
