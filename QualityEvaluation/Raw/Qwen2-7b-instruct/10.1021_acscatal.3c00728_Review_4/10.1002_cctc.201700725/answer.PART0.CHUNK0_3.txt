[1] "Our observations with operando spectroscopy offered important messages towards the understanding of the ODH reaction and the rational design of catalysts, particularly those of the nonmetal category: O2 adsorption but not dissociation is key to a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction."
[2] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between surface reactions and gas-phase radical reactions optimizes catalyst performance and enables the rational design of catalysts. Specifically, the formation of active sites BO(H) at the edges of the catalyst by the aid of ethane plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. These sites abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of adsorbed O2, leading to the formation of olefins. The key to achieving a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction lies in the adsorption of O2 without its dissociation.

多维度的ODHP反应机制，涵盖了催化剂表面和气体相自由基反应，对理解整个反应网络具有重要意义。表面反应与气体相自由基反应之间的协同作用优化了催化剂性能，并促进了催化剂的理性设计。具体而言，在催化剂边缘形成活性位点BO(H)通过乙烷的作用，对于烷烃的脱氢至关重要。这些位点在吸附的O2辅助下从乙烷中抽取氢原子，从而生成烯烃。实现无燃烧烷烃ODH反应的关键在于吸附O2而不使其分解。
