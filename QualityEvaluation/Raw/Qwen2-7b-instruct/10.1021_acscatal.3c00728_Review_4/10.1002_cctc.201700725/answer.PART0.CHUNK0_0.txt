[1] "Our observations with operando spectroscopy offered important messages towards the understanding of the ODH reaction and the rational design of catalysts, particularly those of the nonmetal category: O2 adsorption but not dissociation is key to a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction."
[2] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron nitride (B-based) catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. These reactions contribute to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating how the catalyst surface activates the substrate and how gas-phase reactions complement the surface chemistry. The synergistic effects of these processes are crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the key insights include the importance of O2 adsorption without dissociation for a combustion-free reaction, the formation of active BO(H) sites at the edges of boron nitride nanosheets facilitated by ethane, and the ability of these sites to abstract hydrogen atoms from ethane with the assistance of O2. These findings offer a comprehensive view of the reaction mechanism, guiding the development of efficient and selective catalysts for paraffin conversion.
