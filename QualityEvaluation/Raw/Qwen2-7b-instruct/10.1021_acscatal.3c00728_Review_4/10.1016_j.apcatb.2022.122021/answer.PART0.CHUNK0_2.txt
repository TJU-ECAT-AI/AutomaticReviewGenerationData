[1] "In this work, physical mixtures of Ni NPs and porous h-BN support (NipBN) were used in methane oxidation reaction."
[2] "The classical SMSI state is formed in the NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation where the selectivity can be reversed from CO2 to CO at 600  due to encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support (Ni@BOxpBN)."
[3] "Adding pBN as a diluent to Al2O3 supported Ni catalyst (Ni/Al2O3pBN) further reduces the contact area between Ni NPs and pBN, while the SMSI effect can still occur under the same reaction condition."
[4] "Based on ex-situ and in-situ characterizations, it has been revealed that both high reaction temperature and generated water product are indispensable for the formation and vapor migration of BOx or B(OH)x species from pBN onto Ni NPs."
[5] "Our study reveals a novel mechanism for the formation of encapsulation overlayers on metal nanoparticles under the SMSI state."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these mechanisms implies that the performance of catalysts can be optimized by considering the interplay between surface reactions and gas-phase processes. For instance, the encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support during the methane oxidation reaction demonstrates how surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions can influence product selectivity. By reducing the contact area between Ni NPs and pBN, the SMSI effect can still occur, highlighting the importance of reaction conditions in facilitating vapor migration of boron-containing species. Furthermore, the study reveals that high reaction temperatures and the presence of water are crucial factors for the formation and vapor migration of BOx or B(OH)x species, which are key steps in the SMSI mechanism. These insights into the formation of encapsulation overlayers on metal nanoparticles under the SMSI state offer new avenues for catalyst design and optimization, aiming to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上的多维特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解具有重要意义。这些机制之间的协同作用表明，通过考虑表面反应和气相过程之间的相互作用，可以优化催化剂性能。例如，在甲烷氧化反应中Ni NPs由pBN来源的BOx层包覆，显示了表面化学和气相相互作用如何影响产物选择性。通过减少Ni NPs与pBN的接触面积，即使在相同条件下也能发生SMSI效应，这突出了高温和水存在对于形成和蒸气迁移BOx或B(OH)x物种的重要性。此外，研究揭示了高温和水分对于形成和迁移BOx或B(OH)x物种至关重要，这是SMSI机制的关键步骤。这些关于金属纳米颗粒下SMSI状态下形成封装层的新见解提供了催化剂设计和优化的新途径，旨在提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性。
