[1] "The classical SMSI state is formed in the NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation where the selectivity can be reversed from CO2 to CO at 600 due to encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support (Ni@BOxpBN)."
[2] "Adding pBN as a diluent to Al2O3 supported Ni catalyst (Ni/Al2O3pBN) further reduces the contact area between Ni NPs and pBN, while the SMSI effect can still occur under the same reaction condition."
[3] "It has been revealed that both high reaction temperature and generated water product are indispensable for the formation and vapor migration of BOx or B(OH)x species from pBN onto Ni NPs."
[4] "Our study reveals a novel mechanism for the formation of encapsulation overlayers on metal nanoparticles under the SMSI state."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by illustrating how different components interact. This understanding allows for the identification of synergistic effects between surface reactions and gas-phase processes. The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. By recognizing these interactions, researchers can tailor catalyst properties to enhance efficiency, selectivity, and stability. The encapsulation of metal nanoparticles by boron-containing species under the SMSI state is a novel mechanism that highlights the importance of temperature and water vapor in facilitating the vapor migration of boron-containing species. This insight suggests that by controlling reaction conditions, one can optimize catalyst performance and potentially discover new, more efficient catalysts for specific reactions.
