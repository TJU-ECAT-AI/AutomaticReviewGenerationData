[1] "In this work, physical mixtures of Ni NPs and porous h-BN support (NipBN) were used in methane oxidation reaction. The classical SMSI state is formed in the NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation where the selectivity can be reversed from CO2 to CO at 600 due to encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support (Ni@BOxpBN)."
[2] "The encapsulation structure has been produced under oxidation or other specific reaction conditions."
[3] "For example, Liu et al. reported that Au NPs supported on ZnO nanorods could be encapsulated by zinc oxide (ZnOx) overlayers under oxidation conditions at mild temperatures, in which the formation of Au-O-Zn bonds plays a key role in ZnOx migration onto the surface of Au NPs."
[4] "Upon the formation of the SMSI state in these systems, the metal NPs are in close contact with the supports and thus support-derived species are supposed to migrate along the metal nanoparticle surface to form the ultrathin encapsulation overlayers."
[5] "It is known that both BN and BOx species are very difficult to evaporate for direct gas phase migration."
[6] "Considering that the boron oxides can form volatile boric acid in the presence of high temperature water vapor."
[7] "As a comparison, pBN powder was first treated in O2 at 600 for 12h and its mass was increased by 5.4 % due to the oxidation of pBN into BOx."
[8] "Then, the oxidized pBN powder was further treated in H2O/Ar at 600C for 20h and its mass was decreased by 12.2 %."
[9] "The control experiments indicate that BOx species on the pBN surface can form volatile B(OH)x species in the presence of high temperature water vapor."
[10] "In the initial stage of the reaction, the combustion reaction of methane preferentially occurs on Ni/Al2O3 to generate CO2 and water vapor."
[11] "At the same time, the pBN surface is partially oxidized to generate a large amount of BOx species, which further react with the generated water vapor to produce volatile B(OH)x."
[12] "As the reaction time increases, the volatile B(OH)x can gradually migrate onto the surface of Ni NPs supported on Al2O3 to form encapsulation overlayers, which continues to act as active sites to activate CH4 and O2."
[13] "Interestingly, the BOx overlayers migrated onto the Ni NPs of Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst have better activity and stability than the BOx species on the pBN during the reaction at 600C."
[14] "Therefore, Ni helps dissociate CH4 to generate CHx and H, and H adsorbs onto BOx species to form B-O-H active sites."
[15] "Then, CHx reacts with B-O-H to generate CHxOH, which is further decomposed to CO and H2."
[16] "So, Ni NPs may work synergistically with the BOx/B(OH)x species in the methane oxidation reaction."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interactions between metal nanoparticles and boron-containing species. This understanding allows for a more comprehensive view of how catalyst performance can be optimized. Specifically, the encapsulation of metal nanoparticles by BOx overlayers derived from boron nitride supports, facilitated by the vapor migration of boron-containing species, demonstrates the synergistic effects between different components of the catalyst system. The ability of Ni NPs to help dissociate CH4 and adsorb H, forming active B-O-H sites, highlights the cooperative role of Ni and boron oxides in the methane oxidation process. This synergy is crucial for achieving efficient and selective conversion of methane to CO, as evidenced by the observed changes in product selectivity from CO2 to CO. Furthermore, the control experiments confirming the formation of volatile B(OH)x species upon the reaction of boron oxides with water vapor at high temperatures provide insights into the dynamic migration processes that enable the formation of the SMSI state. These findings underscore the importance of considering both surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions in the design and optimization of catalysts for complex multi-step reactions like the ODHP.

ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上的多维特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解具有重要意义。它揭示了金属纳米颗粒与硼含物种之间复杂相互作用的细节，为我们提供了优化催化剂性能的全面视角。特别是，Ni NPs通过与硼氮化物支持材料产生的BOx层的封装，以及由高温度水蒸气引发的硼含物种的气态迁移现象，表明了催化剂体系中不同组成部分之间的协同效应。Ni NPs帮助分解CH4生成CHx和H，并吸附H形成活性B-O-H位点，这凸显了Ni与硼氧化物在甲烷氧化过程中的合作角色。这种协同作用对于实现高效和选择性地将甲烷转化为CO至关重要，正如观察到的产品选择性从CO2转变为CO所证明的那样。此外，控制实验确认了在高温下水蒸气与硼氧化物反应生成挥发性B(OH)x物种的重要性，这为理解动态迁移过程提供了见解，这些过程能够形成强金属-支持相互作用状态（SMSI）。这些发现强调了在设计和优化复杂多步反应如ODHP的催化剂时，考虑表面化学和气相交互作用的重要性。
