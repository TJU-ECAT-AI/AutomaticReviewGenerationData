[1] "In this work, physical mixtures of Ni NPs and porous h-BN support (NipBN) were used in methane oxidation reaction."
[2] "The SMSI state is formed in the NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation where the selectivity can be reversed from CO2 to CO at 600 due to encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support (Ni@BOxpBN)."
[3] "Based on ex-situ and in-situ characterizations, it has been revealed that both high reaction temperature and generated water product are indispensable for the formation and vapor migration of BOx or B(OH)x species from pBN onto Ni NPs."
[4] "Our study reveals a novel mechanism for the formation of encapsulation overlayers on metal nanoparticles under the SMSI state."

The multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, including both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating how different pathways interact. These interactions imply that the synergistic effects of surface reactions and gas-phase reactions can significantly impact catalyst performance and design optimization. For instance, the encapsulation of Ni nanoparticles by BOx overlayers derived from the porous h-BN support demonstrates how the vapor migration of boron-containing species from the support to the metal surface can lead to the formation of encapsulation structures under the Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) state. This mechanism highlights the importance of considering both surface chemistry and gas-phase processes in the development of efficient catalysts for methane oxidation. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can design catalysts with optimized performance, stability, and selectivity, tailored to specific reaction conditions and requirements.

反应机制的多维特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对于理解整体反应网络具有重要意义。这些交互作用表明，表面反应和气相反应之间的协同效应可以显著影响催化剂性能和设计优化。例如，Ni纳米颗粒被pBN支持衍生的BOx覆盖层所封装，展示了在强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI）状态下，从支持物到金属表面的硼含物种蒸汽迁移如何导致形成封装层结构。这一机制强调了在发展甲烷氧化催化剂时考虑表面化学和气相过程的重要性。通过理解这些机制，研究者可以设计出性能、稳定性和选择性都得到优化的催化剂，适应特定的反应条件和需求。
