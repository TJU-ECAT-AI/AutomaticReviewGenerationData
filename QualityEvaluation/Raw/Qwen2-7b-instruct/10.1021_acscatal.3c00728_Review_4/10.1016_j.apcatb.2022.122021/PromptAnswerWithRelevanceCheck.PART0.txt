[1] "The classical SMSI state is formed in the NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation where the selectivity can be reversed from CO2 to CO at 600 due to encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support (Ni@BOxpBN)."
[2] "Adding pBN as a diluent to Al2O3 supported Ni catalyst (Ni/Al2O3pBN) further reduces the contact area between Ni NPs and pBN, while the SMSI effect can still occur under the same reaction condition."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between these mechanisms implies that the performance of catalysts can be optimized by considering the interplay between surface reactions and gas-phase processes. For instance, the encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support during the methane oxidation reaction demonstrates how surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions can influence product selectivity. By reducing the contact area between Ni NPs and pBN, the SMSI effect can still occur, highlighting the importance of reaction conditions in facilitating vapor migration of boron-containing species. Furthermore, the study reveals that high reaction temperatures and the presence of water are crucial factors for the formation and vapor migration of BOx or B(OH)x species, which are key steps in the SMSI mechanism. These insights into the formation of encapsulation overlayers on metal nanoparticles under the SMSI state offer new avenues for catalyst design and optimization, aiming to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

[1] "In this work, physical mixtures of Ni NPs and porous h-BN support (NipBN) were used in methane oxidation reaction. The classical SMSI state is formed in the NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation where the selectivity can be reversed from CO2 to CO at 600 due to encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support (Ni@BOxpBN)."
[2] "The encapsulation structure has been produced under oxidation or other specific reaction conditions."
[3] "For example, Liu et al. reported that Au NPs supported on ZnO nanorods could be encapsulated by zinc oxide (ZnOx) overlayers under oxidation conditions at mild temperatures, in which the formation of Au-O-Zn bonds plays a key role in ZnOx migration onto the surface of Au NPs."
[4] "Upon the formation of the SMSI state in these systems, the metal NPs are in close contact with the supports and thus support-derived species are supposed to migrate along the metal nanoparticle surface to form the ultrathin encapsulation overlayers."
[5] "It is known that both BN and BOx species are very difficult to evaporate for direct gas phase migration."
[6] "Considering that the boron oxides can form volatile boric acid in the presence of high temperature water vapor."
[7] "As a comparison, pBN powder was first treated in O2 at 600 for 12h and its mass was increased by 5.4 % due to the oxidation of pBN into BOx."
[8] "Then, the oxidized pBN powder was further treated in H2O/Ar at 600C for 20h and its mass was decreased by 12.2 %."
[9] "The control experiments indicate that BOx species on the pBN surface can form volatile B(OH)x species in the presence of high temperature water vapor."
[10] "In the initial stage of the reaction, the combustion reaction of methane preferentially occurs on Ni/Al2O3 to generate CO2 and water vapor."
[11] "At the same time, the pBN surface is partially oxidized to generate a large amount of BOx species, which further react with the generated water vapor to produce volatile B(OH)x."
[12] "As the reaction time increases, the volatile B(OH)x can gradually migrate onto the surface of Ni NPs supported on Al2O3 to form encapsulation overlayers, which continues to act as active sites to activate CH4 and O2."
[13] "Interestingly, the BOx overlayers migrated onto the Ni NPs of Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst have better activity and stability than the BOx species on the pBN during the reaction at 600C."
[14] "Therefore, Ni helps dissociate CH4 to generate CHx and H, and H adsorbs onto BOx species to form B-O-H active sites."
[15] "Then, CHx reacts with B-O-H to generate CHxOH, which is further decomposed to CO and H2."
[16] "So, Ni NPs may work synergistically with the BOx/B(OH)x species in the methane oxidation reaction."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by elucidating the complex interactions between metal nanoparticles and boron-containing species. This understanding allows for a more comprehensive view of how catalyst performance can be optimized. Specifically, the encapsulation of metal nanoparticles by BOx overlayers derived from boron nitride supports, facilitated by the vapor migration of boron-containing species, demonstrates the synergistic effects between different components of the catalyst system. The ability of Ni NPs to help dissociate CH4 and adsorb H, forming active B-O-H sites, highlights the cooperative role of Ni and boron oxides in the methane oxidation process. This synergy is crucial for achieving efficient and selective conversion of methane to CO, as evidenced by the observed changes in product selectivity from CO2 to CO. Furthermore, the control experiments confirming the formation of volatile B(OH)x species upon the reaction of boron oxides with water vapor at high temperatures provide insights into the dynamic migration processes that enable the formation of the SMSI state. These findings underscore the importance of considering both surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions in the design and optimization of catalysts for complex multi-step reactions like the ODHP.
