[1] "Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown."
[2] "The ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process."
[3] "From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism."
[4] "Mechanism studies about the hexagonal BN are first explored. (25) Kinetic analysis showed that the consumption rate of propane followed partial order in PO2, while it followed the second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 over the h-BN catalyst."
[5] "In situ IR spectroscopy demonstrated that the intensity of BOH vibration continually weakened with the introduction of O2 to the propane atmosphere."
[6] "The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction (Figure 8a)."
[7] "For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual-process approach reveals the complex interplay between surface catalysis and gas-phase radical reactions, offering insights into the activation of alkanes and the intricate interactions between different intermediates. The synergistic effects between the surface and gas-phase reactions play a pivotal role in optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the propene selectivity during the ODHP process. The surface reactions primarily involve the formation of reactive species like BO· and ·OOH, which abstract hydrogen from propane to produce propene. Meanwhile, the gas-phase radical reactions, particularly those involving alkyl radicals, contribute to the formation of olefin products and compete with the surface reactions for alkyl radical elimination. The efficiency of these reactions and their coupling are critical for achieving high activity and propene selectivity. Factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the intrinsic catalytic properties of B-based catalysts significantly influence the performance of the ODHP reaction. Optimizing these factors can lead to more effective B-based catalytic systems tailored for enhanced ODHP performance.
