The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual-process approach reveals the complex interplay between surface catalysis and gas-phase radical reactions, offering insights into the activation of alkanes and the intricate interactions between different intermediates. The synergistic effects between the surface and gas-phase reactions play a pivotal role in optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the propene selectivity during the ODHP process. The surface reactions primarily involve the formation of reactive species like BO· and ·OOH, which abstract hydrogen from propane to produce propene. Meanwhile, the gas-phase radical reactions, particularly those involving alkyl radicals, contribute to the formation of olefin products and compete with the surface reactions for alkyl radical elimination. The efficiency of these reactions and their coupling are critical for achieving high activity and propene selectivity. Factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the intrinsic catalytic properties of B-based catalysts significantly influence the performance of the ODHP reaction. Optimizing these factors can lead to more effective B-based catalytic systems tailored for enhanced ODHP performance.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding highlights the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, which together govern the selective formation of propene and other products. The synergistic effects between these two reaction domains are crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing propene selectivity.

By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into how reactant molecules activate, transform, and interact within the 3D space of the catalyst. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to achieve high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.

Optimizing catalyst design requires considering factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. By achieving synergy between these domains, it becomes possible to develop more effective B-based catalysts tailored for the ODHP reaction. This synergy allows for the efficient utilization of reactants, minimizes byproduct formation, and maximizes the production of desired products like propene, ultimately contributing to enhanced catalytic performance and economic efficiency in industrial applications.

3. Dimensional Understanding of the ODHP Reaction Mechanism over B-Based Catalysts

The whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown. With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process.

Surface Reaction Mechanism

Mechanism studies about the hexagonal BN are first explored. Kinetic analysis showed that the consumption rate of propane followed partial order in PO2, while it followed the second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 over the h-BN catalyst, which was evidently different from the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism of the traditional metal oxide catalysts.

Gas Radical Reaction Mechanism

The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction. Theoretically, the cleavage of the CC bond of propane will generate one C2 and one C1 fragment. If no further reaction exists, the carbon-based selectivity of C2/C1 products will be equal to 2. However, it is widely observed that the practical measured value of C2/C1 is larger than 2, which implies there must be one or more extra pathways that consume C1 to form C2 products in the ODHP reaction.

Reaction Networks of ODHP Reactions with Surface and Gas-Phase Radicals

For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different. According to the previous studies, the BOB (derived from BOx-based catalyst) and {BB} (derived from the oxygen functionalization of BN-based catalyst) are the basic precursors for the B active site on the catalyst surface. They could convert to the commonly accepted surface-active site of BO· after oxygen functionalization with the formation of the important gas radical ·OOH.

Synergistic Effects

The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by revealing a complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes. This complexity highlights the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction are critical for achieving high activity and high propene selectivity in the ODHP process. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a comprehensive understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

Implications of their synergistic effects include the potential for enhancing catalyst efficiency through optimized mass and heat transfer configurations, improved mass-specific reaction rates, and the ability to manage radical transport and reactions across the surface and gas phases. Catalyst design must account for the dynamic exchange of free radicals between the surface and gas phase to achieve a balanced and efficient reaction network.

Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions such as partial pressures of reactants, reaction temperature, and WHSV (Weight Hourly Space Velocity), as well as the catalyst bed configuration. The choice of catalyst material, reactor dimensions, and gas composition can significantly impact the optimal configuration for maximizing reaction performance.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions occur not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. The synergistic effects of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. The reaction conditions, such as the partial pressure of reactants, reaction temperature, and WHSV, are critical factors influencing both surface and radical reactions. Catalyst bed configurations also impact the reaction rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing the catalyst's physical properties for enhanced performance.

The implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design optimization are substantial. By understanding the detailed activation manner of alkanes and the interplay between different intermediates, researchers can tailor catalysts to maximize propene production while minimizing byproducts like COx. The ability to control the transport and reaction of free radicals between the surface and gas phase through catalyst configuration suggests that designing catalysts with optimized geometry and composition can lead to more efficient and selective ODHP processes.

Furthermore, the discovery of the mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface initiates alkyl radical formation that further reacts in the gas phase, opens new avenues for enhancing reaction kinetics and product selectivity. This understanding not only deepens our knowledge of the ODHP reaction mechanism but also paves the way for the development of more effective B-based catalytic systems tailored to specific reaction conditions and desired end products.
