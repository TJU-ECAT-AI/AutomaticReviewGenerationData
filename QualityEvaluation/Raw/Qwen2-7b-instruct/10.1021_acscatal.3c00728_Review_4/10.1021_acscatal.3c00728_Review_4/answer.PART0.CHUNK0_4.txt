The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. These mechanisms reveal that the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. This spatial complexity involves intricate interactions between surface and gas-phase reactions, which are essential for the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP. The synergistic effects of these two processes are critical for optimizing catalyst performance and designing more effective B-based catalytic systems.

The surface reaction mechanism involves the hexagonal BN catalyst, where the oxygen bonded to the boron nitride surface stabilizes propyl intermediates through hydrogen abstraction. This leads to the formation of dipropoxyl intermediates, which are precursors to propene. The gas radical reaction mechanism is characterized by the radical reactions in the 3-D gas phase, which play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of the ODHP reaction. The radical species generated on the catalyst surface are capable of reacting with gas-phase reactants, contributing to the formation of C2 products.

The reaction networks involving surface and gas-phase radical reactions are interconnected and influence each other. The surface reaction rate affects the gas-phase free radical processes, while the gas-phase radical reaction impacts the surface reaction. This interplay is essential for achieving high activity and high propene selectivity in the ODHP reaction. By understanding the synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can design more effective B-based catalysts that optimize the ODHP reaction mechanism.

The proposed mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism highlights the role of the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the catalyst surface in initiating alkyl radical formation, which subsequently reacts in the gas phase. This mechanism underscores the importance of achieving the synergy between surface and gas radical reactions to enhance the ODHP reaction mechanism and develop more effective B-based catalytic systems. Catalyst bed configurations, reaction conditions, and intrinsic catalytic properties of B-based catalysts are crucial factors influencing the ODHP reaction, and optimizing these aspects is vital for improving catalyst performance.
