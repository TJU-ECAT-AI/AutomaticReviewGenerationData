3. Dimensional Understanding of the ODHP Reaction Mechanism over B-Based Catalysts

The whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown. With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process.

Surface Reaction Mechanism

Mechanism studies about the hexagonal BN are first explored. Kinetic analysis showed that the consumption rate of propane followed partial order in PO2, while it followed the second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 over the h-BN catalyst, which was evidently different from the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism of the traditional metal oxide catalysts.

Gas Radical Reaction Mechanism

The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction. Theoretically, the cleavage of the CC bond of propane will generate one C2 and one C1 fragment. If no further reaction exists, the carbon-based selectivity of C2/C1 products will be equal to 2. However, it is widely observed that the practical measured value of C2/C1 is larger than 2, which implies there must be one or more extra pathways that consume C1 to form C2 products in the ODHP reaction.

Reaction Networks of ODHP Reactions with Surface and Gas-Phase Radicals

For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different. According to the previous studies, the BOB (derived from BOx-based catalyst) and {BB} (derived from the oxygen functionalization of BN-based catalyst) are the basic precursors for the B active site on the catalyst surface. They could convert to the commonly accepted surface-active site of BO· after oxygen functionalization with the formation of the important gas radical ·OOH.

Synergistic Effects

The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by revealing a complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes. This complexity highlights the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction are critical for achieving high activity and high propene selectivity in the ODHP process. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a comprehensive understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.

Implications of their synergistic effects include the potential for enhancing catalyst efficiency through optimized mass and heat transfer configurations, improved mass-specific reaction rates, and the ability to manage radical transport and reactions across the surface and gas phases. Catalyst design must account for the dynamic exchange of free radicals between the surface and gas phase to achieve a balanced and efficient reaction network.

Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions such as partial pressures of reactants, reaction temperature, and WHSV (Weight Hourly Space Velocity), as well as the catalyst bed configuration. The choice of catalyst material, reactor dimensions, and gas composition can significantly impact the optimal configuration for maximizing reaction performance.
