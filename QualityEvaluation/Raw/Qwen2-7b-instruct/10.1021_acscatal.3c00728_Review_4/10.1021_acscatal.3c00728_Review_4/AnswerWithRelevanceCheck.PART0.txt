          "[1] Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown.
          [2] From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism.
          [3] Mechanism studies about the hexagonal BN are first explored.
          [4] The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction.
          [5] On the basis of the aforementioned research summary, we have attempted to plot the reaction networks to correlate the surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions, as shown in Figure 9.
          [6] For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different.
          [7] During the ODHP reaction, the dehydrogenation of propane mainly occurs via the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by the reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals.
          [8] The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction.
          [9] The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase.
          [10] Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding emphasizes the importance of considering both the surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics in the catalytic system. The synergistic effects between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes, which govern the selective formation of propene and other products. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to realize high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. Key factors affecting the surface and radical reactions include reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Optimizing catalyst performance and design requires a thorough understanding of how these two-dimensional processes interact and influence each other.
