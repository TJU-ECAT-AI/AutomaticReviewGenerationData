3.1.1. "Kinetic analysis showed that the consumption rate of propane followed partial order in PO2, while it followed the second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 over the h-BN catalyst, which was evidently different from the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism of the traditional metal oxide catalysts."

3.1.2. "This phenomenon suggested that the oxygen bonded to the boron nitride surface was relatively stable in the presence of propane."

3.1.3. "The surface-stabilized propyl intermediate [namely, >NOCH(CH3)2] was generated by the cleavage of the OO bond, creating the BO and NO species to accommodate H and secondary propyl radicals, respectively."

3.1.4. "After the desorption of propene, the >BOON< active sites were regenerated by cleaving the OH bond and oxygen extracting hydrogen."

3.2.1. "The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction."

3.2.2. "Wang et al. (108) designed experiments to verify the role of the oxidative coupling of the methane (OCM) reaction into C2 speciation on the h-BN catalyst."

3.2.3. "In the control and blank experiments in the presence of a catalyst at room temperature and without a catalyst at elevated temperatures, no radical signal was detected."

3.3.1. "For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different."

3.3.2. "The highly reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals formed by H abstraction of BOH by O2 could invoke the dehydrogenation of propane via the surface channel and gas channel, respectively."

3.3.3. "In addition, the latest study by the Lus group revealed that the in situ-formed propene under ODHP reactions actively accelerated the parent propane conversion by interacting with ·OOH and ·OC3H7 radicals and generated propene oxide (PO), which was further oxidized to ethene and CO."

3.4.1. "Venegas et al. (103) related the contributions of catalyst bed configuration to the observed reactivity of h-BN catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. These reactions occur not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. The synergistic effects of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction play a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during the ODHP process. The reaction conditions, such as the partial pressure of reactants, reaction temperature, and WHSV, are critical factors influencing both surface and radical reactions. Catalyst bed configurations also impact the reaction rates, highlighting the importance of optimizing the catalyst's physical properties for enhanced performance.

The implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design optimization are substantial. By understanding the detailed activation manner of alkanes and the interplay between different intermediates, researchers can tailor catalysts to maximize propene production while minimizing byproducts like COx. The ability to control the transport and reaction of free radicals between the surface and gas phase through catalyst configuration suggests that designing catalysts with optimized geometry and composition can lead to more efficient and selective ODHP processes.

Furthermore, the discovery of the mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface initiates alkyl radical formation that further reacts in the gas phase, opens new avenues for enhancing reaction kinetics and product selectivity. This understanding not only deepens our knowledge of the ODHP reaction mechanism but also paves the way for the development of more effective B-based catalytic systems tailored to specific reaction conditions and desired end products.

多维的ODHP反应机制，包括B基催化剂上的表面和气体相自由基反应，对总体反应网络的理解至关重要。这些反应不仅发生在1-和2-D表面活性位点上，而且在气体相中的三维空间中也发生。表面反应与气体自由基反应的协同作用在实现高活性和高丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用。反应条件，如反应物分压、反应温度和WHVS，是影响表面和自由基反应的关键因素。催化剂床配置也影响反应速率，强调优化催化剂物理性质对于提高性能的重要性。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响巨大。通过理解烷烃的详细激活方式以及不同中间体之间的相互作用，研究人员可以定制催化剂以最大化丙烯产量并减少COx等副产品的生成。通过控制表面和气体相之间自由基的传输和反应的能力，表明通过调整催化剂的几何形状和组成，可以导致更有效且选择性更高的ODHP过程。

此外，混合异质同质ODH机制的发现，其中催化剂表面的硼氧化物/羟基相启动烷基自由基的形成，然后在气体相中进一步反应，为增强反应动力学和目标产物的选择性开辟了新途径。这一理解不仅加深了我们对ODHP反应机制的理解，而且为定制特定反应条件和期望最终产品的更有效的B基催化系统铺平了道路。
