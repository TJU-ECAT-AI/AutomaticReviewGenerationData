[1] "Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown."
[2] "From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism."
[3] "The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction (Figure 8a)."
[4] "The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."
[5] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, incorporating both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding highlights the complex interplay between surface chemistry and gas-phase dynamics, which together govern the selective formation of propene and other products. The synergistic effects between these two reaction domains are crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing propene selectivity.

By integrating the surface reaction mechanism with the gas radical reaction mechanism, researchers gain insights into how reactant molecules activate, transform, and interact within the 3D space of the catalyst. This comprehensive view elucidates the pathways through which alkanes are dehydrogenated, providing a foundation for predicting and controlling product distribution. The interdependence of surface and gas-phase reactions underscores the importance of coupling these processes efficiently to achieve high activity and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.

Optimizing catalyst design requires considering factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst bed configuration, and the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. By achieving synergy between these domains, it becomes possible to develop more effective B-based catalysts tailored for the ODHP reaction. This synergy allows for the efficient utilization of reactants, minimizes byproduct formation, and maximizes the production of desired products like propene, ultimately contributing to enhanced catalytic performance and economic efficiency in industrial applications.
