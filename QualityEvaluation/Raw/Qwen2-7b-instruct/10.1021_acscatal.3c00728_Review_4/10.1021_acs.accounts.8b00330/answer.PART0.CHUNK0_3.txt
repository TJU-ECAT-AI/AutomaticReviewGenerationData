[1] "The reactivity of hBN seems inherently linked to oxygen activation under reaction conditions."
[2] "The critical role of activated oxygen during hBN-catalyzed ODH, as well as additional reactivity differences with vanadium oxide catalysts, was highlighted by the selectivity dependence on oxygen partial pressure."
[3] "The common conversion-selectivity trends found with all active borides suggest the presence of a common active site."
[4] "The differences in active site densities between boron-based catalysts could be due to surface area, surface area alone cannot explain the variations in reactivity."
[5] "Solid-state NMR has allowed us to probe the surface of hBN after ODH and find a complex surface with a distribution of oxidized boron species."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions implies that catalyst performance and design optimization should consider the interplay between these two domains. For instance, the enhanced reactivity of B-based catalysts might arise from the effective activation of oxygen species on the surface, which subsequently promotes the formation of alkyl radicals that undergo gas-phase reactions leading to olefin formation. The implications of these synergistic effects include the potential for designing catalysts that can efficiently manage both surface and gas-phase reactions, leading to improved selectivity and yield of olefins. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially for industrial applications.

多维性质的ODHP反应机制在B基催化剂上对整体反应网络的理解贡献巨大，因为它包含了表面和气相自由基反应两个维度。这两种反应之间的协同作用暗示，在设计催化剂时应该考虑表面和气相反应之间的相互作用。例如，B基催化剂增强的活性可能源自表面氧物种的有效激活，随后促进了烷基自由基的形成，这些自由基在气相中进行反应以生成烯烃。这些协同效应的含义包括有可能设计出既能高效管理表面和气相反应又能提高烯烃选择性和产率的催化剂。这种理解可以指导开发更高效的、选择性更好的催化剂用于烷烃的氧化脱氢，尤其是工业应用。
