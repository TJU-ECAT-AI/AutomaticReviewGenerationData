[1] "The product distribution during ODH differs greatly from that of metal oxide catalysts, which typically show significant amounts of overoxidation products."
[2] "We identified the formation of BOx species as critical to the observed catalysis via ex situ XPS, FTIR, and reaction kinetic measurements."
[3] "Initial computational simulations suggested BOON species as possible active sites on hBN, but the common conversion-selectivity trends of several borides suggest that further investigations to elucidate a common active site are critical to understand the high olefin selectivity of these materials."

During oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the product distribution varies significantly compared to metal oxide catalysts, which often exhibit substantial overoxidation products. We pinpointed the creation of BOx species as pivotal to the observed catalytic activity through ex situ XPS, FTIR, and reaction kinetic analyses. Initial computer simulations proposed BOON species as potential active sites on hBN, but the consistent conversion-selectivity patterns across multiple borides indicate the necessity for further research to uncover a shared active site mechanism, which is essential for grasping the high olefin selectivity of these materials.
