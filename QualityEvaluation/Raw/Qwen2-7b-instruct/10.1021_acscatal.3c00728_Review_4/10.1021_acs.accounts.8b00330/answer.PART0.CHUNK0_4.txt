[1] "The reactivity of hBN seems inherently linked to oxygen activation under reaction conditions."
[2] "We monitored the influence of reactant partial pressures on the rate of alkane consumption and found a second order rate dependence on alkane partial pressure and only a minor dependence on oxygen partial pressure."
[3] "The critical role of activated oxygen during hBN-catalyzed ODH, as well as additional reactivity differences with vanadium oxide catalysts, was highlighted by the selectivity dependence on oxygen partial pressure."
[4] "The lack of lattice oxygen in hBN suggests that oxygen must be directly involved during a catalytic turnover."
[5] "We identified the formation of BOx species as critical to the observed catalysis via ex situ XPS, FTIR, and reaction kinetic measurements."
[6] "While initial computational simulations suggested BOON species as possible active sites on hBN, the common conversion-selectivity trends of several borides suggests that further investigations to elucidate a common active site are critical to understand the high olefin selectivity of these materials."
[7] "Solid-state NMR has allowed us to probe the surface of hBN after ODH and find a complex surface with a distribution of oxidized boron species."
[8] "In situ characterization and chemisorption approaches will be important for elucidating the active sites of the working catalyst."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the synergistic effects of these processes on catalyst performance and design optimization. Specifically, the involvement of oxygen activation, the role of BOx species, and the complexity of the surface chemistry play crucial roles in the selective oxidation of alkanes to olefins. By elucidating these aspects, researchers can better tailor catalysts to achieve optimal product distributions and enhance reaction efficiency. This knowledge is essential for advancing the development of more effective and sustainable catalytic systems for alkane oxidation processes.
