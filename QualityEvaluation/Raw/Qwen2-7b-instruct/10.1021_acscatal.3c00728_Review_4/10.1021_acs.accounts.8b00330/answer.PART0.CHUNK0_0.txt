1. The main challenge in selective oxidation processes, especially in the context of propane oxidation, is to prevent the undesired overoxidation of propylene to carbon monoxide and dioxide. This requires careful control over the reaction conditions to ensure the product remains as the desired propylene.

2. Rational catalyst design has been effective in creating homogeneous catalyst systems, but its application in heterogeneous catalyst development is more limited. The complexity of heterogeneous catalysts, with their diverse surface terminations and bulk structures, often leads to serendipitous discoveries rather than deliberate design.

3. The significance of catalysis research is not just in the development of new catalysts but also in understanding the underlying principles of serendipity that can lead to unexpected discoveries. This highlights the importance of continued exploration and investigation in the field.

4. The catalysts investigated showed a higher propylene selectivity compared to metal oxide catalysts, indicating a unique property that distinguishes them in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process.

5. The role of oxygen activation during the oxidative dehydrogenation on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was critical. The selectivity of hBN towards the desired product was influenced by the oxygen partial pressure, highlighting the importance of oxygen in the catalytic process.

6. A notable observation was the common conversion-selectivity trend found across all active boron-based catalysts, regardless of the specific material used. This suggests a universal active site or mechanism that governs the ODH process.

7. The reactivity differences among boron-based catalysts could be attributed to variations in surface area, indicating that the density of active sites might depend on the surface area of the catalyst.

8. The crystal structures of boron-containing catalysts that showed activity in the ODH process featured large continuous boron networks, such as B12 icosahedra in elemental boron and hexagonal B layers in nickel boride (NiB) and titanium boride (TiB2).

9. The methodologies and findings of previous researchers, such as Buyevskaya et al. and Cucinieri Colorio et al., offer additional approaches that could be useful in characterizing boron-based catalysts in the future, complementing existing techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

1. 在选择性氧化过程中，尤其是丙烷氧化中，主要挑战在于防止所需产品的过度氧化，如丙烯转化为CO和CO2。这需要对反应条件进行精确控制，以确保产物保持为所需的丙烯。

2. 合理催化剂设计在同质催化剂系统中取得了成功，但在异质催化剂开发中的实际应用较为有限。异质催化剂的复杂性，包括其多样的表面终端和基体结构，往往导致偶然发现而非有意识的设计。

3. 催化剂研究的重要性不仅在于新催化剂的发展，还在于理解偶然性背后的科学原理，这种偶然性可以导致意外的发现。这强调了该领域持续探索和调查的重要性。

4. 所研究的催化剂显示出与金属氧化物催化剂相比更高的丙烯选择性，表明它们在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中的独特性质。

5. 在六方氮化硼（hBN）催化的氧化脱氢过程中，氧气激活的作用至关重要。丙烯选择性受到氧分压的影响，突显了氧气在催化过程中的重要性。

6. 一个值得注意的观察是所有活性硼基催化剂之间共有的转化-选择性趋势，无论具体材料如何使用。这表明在所有测试材料中可能存在一个通用的活性位点或机制来指导ODH过程。

7. 硼基催化剂的反应性差异可能归因于表面面积的变化，暗示活性位点密度可能依赖于催化剂的表面面积。

8. 显示出活性的硼化合物催化剂的晶体结构特征为大连续硼网络，例如元素硼中的B12二十面体和镍硼（NiB）或钛硼（TiB2）中的六边形B层。

9. 以前研究人员，如Buyevskaya等人和Cucinieri Colorio等人，的方法和发现提供了未来用于表征硼基催化剂的额外方法，补充现有的技术，如核磁共振（NMR）。
