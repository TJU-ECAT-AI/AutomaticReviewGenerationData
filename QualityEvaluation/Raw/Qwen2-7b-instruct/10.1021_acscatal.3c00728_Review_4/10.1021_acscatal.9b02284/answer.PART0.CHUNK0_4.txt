The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism on boron oxide catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This dual-dimensional characteristic contributes significantly to the overall reaction network by enabling synergistic effects among different reaction pathways. These interactions provide valuable insights into how boron oxide catalysts perform and how they can be optimized for better efficiency and selectivity in the dehydrogenation process.
