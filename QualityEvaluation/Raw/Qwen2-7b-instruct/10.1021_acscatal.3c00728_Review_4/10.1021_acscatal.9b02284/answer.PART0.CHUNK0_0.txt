The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides insights into the comprehensive reaction pathway. The synergistic effects of these processes lead to a deeper understanding of the overall reaction network. These effects have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, resulting in improved selectivity and activity.
