The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, such as silicon boride, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complexity involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, which work synergistically to enhance catalyst performance and optimize design. Surface reactions on the boron sites lead to the generation of reactive species like BOH groups, which can participate in the cleavage of the CH bond in alkanes to form olefins. Meanwhile, gas-phase reactions, involving the dissociation of molecular oxygen and its interaction with these surface species, facilitate the formation of active sites necessary for olefin production. The synergy between these surface and gas-phase processes enables the efficient conversion of alkanes to olefins with high selectivity and stability. This understanding provides insights into how boron-based catalysts, like silicon boride, can be designed and optimized for improved performance in industrial applications.
