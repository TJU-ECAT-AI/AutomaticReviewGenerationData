Silicon boride is an active metal-free catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to valuable olefins with high selectivity. When the conversion of ethane, propane, and isobutane reached 18.8%, 19.1%, and 6.0%, the selectivity of total olefins were up to 98.0%, 94.4%, and 96.4%, respectively. The light olefins productivity of 1.2-2.6 g/olefins/gcat/h were obtained. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability. Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding reveals the complex interplay between surface-bound boron species and molecular oxygen, leading to the generation of reactive intermediates that facilitate the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen bonds in alkanes. The synergistic effects of these surface and gas-phase reactions highlight the importance of both the surface chemistry of the catalyst and the kinetic properties of the reactants in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process.

The implications of these synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization are profound. They suggest that the development of boron-based catalysts should focus on enhancing the stability and reactivity of surface-bound boron species, particularly the boron-oxygen (BOH) groups, which are proposed to act as key catalytic sites. Additionally, strategies aimed at improving the interaction between molecular oxygen and the catalyst surface, such as the use of promoters or modifying the catalyst's microenvironment, could lead to enhanced selectivity and stability.

Furthermore, the identification of the boron-oxygen species as critical components of the catalytic process provides insights into how the catalysts can be optimized for specific reaction conditions. For instance, the use of precursors that readily form boron-oxygen groups or the incorporation of elements that enhance the formation of these species could potentially improve the catalyst's performance for ODHP. This knowledge also opens up avenues for the exploration of other boron-based catalysts and the development of novel synthetic routes to create catalysts with tailored properties for specific applications in the chemical industry.

In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts underscores the complexity of the process and the intricate relationship between the catalyst's surface chemistry, the kinetic properties of the reactants, and the catalytic activity. This understanding not only deepens our knowledge of the underlying chemical processes but also guides the rational design and optimization of catalysts for more efficient and selective ODHP reactions.
