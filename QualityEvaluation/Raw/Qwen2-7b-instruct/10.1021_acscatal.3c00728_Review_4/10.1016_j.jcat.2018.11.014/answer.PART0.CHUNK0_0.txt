<p>The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability.</p>
<p>Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The silicon boride's ability to resist oxidation at high temperatures contributes to its catalytic stability, allowing it to maintain consistent performance over extended periods.
2. The boron species on the surface of the metal-free catalyst, particularly the BOH groups formed from BO species with assistance from steam, are likely the active sites driving the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
