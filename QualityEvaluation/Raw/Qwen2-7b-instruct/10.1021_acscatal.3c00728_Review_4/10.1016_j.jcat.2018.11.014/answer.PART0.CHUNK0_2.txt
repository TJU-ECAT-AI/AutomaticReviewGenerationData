The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding reveals that the synergistic effects between these reactions are crucial for catalyst performance and design optimization. The surface reactions facilitate the formation of active sites, such as BOH groups, which play key roles in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, gas-phase radical reactions enable the efficient utilization of oxygen and the formation of olefin products. The interplay between these mechanisms ensures high selectivity and stability, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency and productivity. This knowledge can guide the development of more effective catalysts by optimizing the balance between surface and gas-phase activities, potentially improving the yield and purity of olefin products.
