The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, plays a crucial role in understanding the overall reaction network. This interplay between on-surface and off-surface processes provides insights into how these catalysts function. The synergistic effects of these processes have important implications for enhancing catalyst performance and optimizing their design.
