Answer: The multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface reactions and gas-phase radical reactions. This interplay contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network, revealing how these processes interact and influence one another. The synergistic effects of these interactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. By elucidating these mechanisms, researchers can tailor catalysts to enhance selectivity, efficiency, and stability, leading to improved process outcomes in chemical synthesis and catalysis.
