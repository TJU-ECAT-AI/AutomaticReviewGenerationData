[1] "Acids 3a3f (general procedure). A suspension of 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 3040 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 2025C until complete dissolution of the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to 05C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys- tallized from acetonitrile."

The synthesis of 2-{2-[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinyl}-4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids involves reacting 1-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-[(triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)hydrazinylidene]ethanone with 4-aryl(hetaryl)-2,4-dioxobutanoic acids. These acids then undergo cyclization to form 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]-hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones. The products were isolated as yellow crystalline substances and showed characteristic IR spectra bands. The IR spectra of the cyclized products contained absorption bands due to stretching vibrations of the C2=O carbonyl group in the furan ring (1790-1857 cm−1), adamantoyl carbonyl (1672-1692 cm−1), and C=C and C=N bonds (1584-1631 cm−1). The final compounds, 3E-3-{[(2Z)-2-(Adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethyli- dene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(het- aryl)furan-2(3H)-ones 4a4f, were isolated as orange crystalline substances with specific IR spectra bands.
