The initial acids can be synthesized through a reaction involving phosphazenes and specific butanoic acid derivatives. The compounds 3a3f exist as a mixture of Z- and E-isomeric enehydrazine tautomers, with structure A being predominant. Isomer B shows different spectral characteristics. These compounds undergo intramolecular cyclization in boiling acetic anhydride to form furan-2(3H)-ones. The purity and progress of the reactions are determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with specific eluents and detection under UV light.

The initial acids used in the synthesis process can be prepared through the reaction of phosphazenes with specific 4-aryl-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid derivatives. These acids were synthesized by cyclizing 2-hydrazinyl derivatives of 4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids, which incorporated a pharmacophoric adamantyl fragment. The isolated acids were characterized by their yellow crystalline appearance and exhibited specific infrared spectra. Upon undergoing intramolecular cyclization in boiling acetic anhydride, the synthesized compounds transformed into (3E)-3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones, which were identified as orange crystalline substances.

The synthesis of 2-{2-[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinyl}-4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids involves reacting 1-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-[(triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)hydrazinylidene]ethanone with 4-aryl(hetaryl)-2,4-dioxobutanoic acids. These acids then undergo cyclization to form 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]-hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones. The products were isolated as yellow crystalline substances and showed characteristic IR spectra bands. The IR spectra of the cyclized products contained absorption bands due to stretching vibrations of the C2=O carbonyl group in the furan ring (1790-1857 cm−1), adamantoyl carbonyl (1672-1692 cm−1), and C=C and C=N bonds (1584-1631 cm−1).
