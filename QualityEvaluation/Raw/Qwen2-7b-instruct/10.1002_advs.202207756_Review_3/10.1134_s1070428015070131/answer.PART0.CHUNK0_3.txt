The initial acids used in the synthesis process can be prepared through the reaction of phosphazenes with specific 4-aryl-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid derivatives. These acids were synthesized by cyclizing 2-hydrazinyl derivatives of 4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids, which incorporated a pharmacophoric adamantyl fragment. The isolated acids were characterized by their yellow crystalline appearance and exhibited specific infrared spectra. Upon undergoing intramolecular cyclization in boiling acetic anhydride, the synthesized compounds transformed into (3E)-3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones, which were identified as orange crystalline substances.

在合成过程中使用的初始酸可以通过磷酰胺与特定4-芳基-2,4-二氧丁酸衍生物的反应来制备。通过环化2-腙衍生物的4-芳基(杂环)-4-氧丁-2-烯酸，这些酸合成了一种包含药效学亚达曼坦基团的化合物，并以黄色结晶的形式被分离出来。这些酸在红外光谱中显示出特定的吸收峰。在沸点乙酸酐的作用下，合成的化合物经过内环化转化为(3E)-3-{[2-(3-R-亚达曼坦-1-基)-2-氧乙基双键]腙基}-5-芳基(杂环)呋喃-2(3H)-酮，这些产物被识别为橙色结晶物质。
