The initial acids can be synthesized through a reaction involving phosphazenes and specific butanoic acid derivatives. The compounds 3a3f exist as a mixture of Z- and E-isomeric enehydrazine tautomers, with structure A being predominant. Isomer B shows different spectral characteristics. These compounds undergo intramolecular cyclization in boiling acetic anhydride to form furan-2(3H)-ones. The purity and progress of the reactions are determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with specific eluents and detection under UV light.

初始酸可以通过反应磷化物和特定的丁二酸衍生物来合成。化合物3a3f以Z-和E-异构的烯基腙异构体混合存在，其中结构A为主导。异构体B显示出不同的光谱特征。这些化合物在沸点乙酸酐中进行分子内环化形成呋喃-2(3H)-酮。通过使用特定的洗脱剂和紫外光下检测，纯度和反应进展是通过薄层色谱（TLC）来确定的。
