[1] "A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as promoter."
[2] "A novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane is presented. The catalyst consists of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina."
[3] "The synergy between Ga and Pt results in a highly active and stable catalyst."
[4] "The recent exploration and production of hydrocarbons from shale basins in the USA such as in Barnett, Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford, has led to a rebound in its energy competitiveness."
[5] "Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome."
[6] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element."
[7] "It was found that the catalytic conversion varies strongly between the different catalyst materials. In case of the catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, this value is close to the equilibrium conversion (which is ca. 55% at 620C and 1atm pressure) for the first dehydrogenation cycle."
[8] "In the absence of K (PtGa), the darkening is a more gradual process that continues throughout the cycle."
[9] "A possible explanation is that Pt further dehydrogenates the carbon deposits, leading to a higher graphitic portion in the coke."
[10] "The only Pt-containing catalyst is almost inactive in the dehydrogenation reaction and the Pt dispersion drops severely after treatment under air at elevated temperatures, it is assumed that coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are responsible for the CH bond activation."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the structure and accessibility of gallium sites on the catalyst. The synergy between gallium and platinum leads to the formation of active gallium species, particularly coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species, which are crucial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The addition of potassium enhances propene selectivity and reduces coke deposition, indicating its role in improving catalyst stability. Platinum, while not the active dehydrogenation element in traditional systems, acts as a promoter in this context, assisting in the recombination of hydrogen atoms and making active sites available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles. The catalyst's structure-activity correlations are thus deeply intertwined with the interplay between gallium, platinum, and potassium, along with the physical properties of the zeolite framework.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度在改性沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物，这通过影响催化剂的结构和镓位点的可接近性来实现。镓与铂之间的协同作用导致活性镓物种的形成，特别是协调不饱和Ga3+物种，这是丙烷脱氢反应的关键。钾的添加提高了丙烯的选择性和减少了焦炭沉积，表明其在提高催化剂稳定性方面的作用。虽然在传统系统中，铂不是脱氢作用元素，但在这种情况下，它作为促进剂发挥作用，帮助氢原子的重组，并使活性位点可供后续脱氢循环使用。因此，催化剂的结构-活性相关性深刻地交织在镓、铂、钾之间的相互作用以及沸石骨架的物理属性之间。
