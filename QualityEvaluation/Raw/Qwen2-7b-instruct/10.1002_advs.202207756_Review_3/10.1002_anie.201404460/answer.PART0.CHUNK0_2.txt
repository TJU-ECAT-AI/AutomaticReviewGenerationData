[1] "A catalyst material consisting of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina has been presented."
[2] "We observed a synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst."
[3] "Ga performs the actual dehydrogenation reaction and Pt being a unique promoting element."
[4] "A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as promoter."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, specifically the presence of 3wt% gallium in the catalyst material, contributes to the formation of coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species, which are the active dehydrogenation species. The Pt/Al ratio, with 1000ppm of platinum, acts as a unique promoter that enhances the catalyst's activity and stability. The synergy between Ga and Pt results in a bifunctional active phase where Pt supports the dehydrogenation process facilitated by the Ga species.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
Ga/Al比例，特别是催化剂中3wt%的镓，有助于形成可配位不饱和的Ga3+物种，这些是实际脱氢反应的活性物种。Pt/Al比例，其中包含1000ppm的铂，作为独特的促进剂，提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。Ga与Pt之间的协同作用导致了一个双功能活性相，其中Pt支持由Ga物种促进的脱氢过程。
