<p>Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts.9 Indeed, a slight increase is observed in propene selectivity after addition of K to the Pt and Ga containing catalysts.</p>
<p>Finally, the bare support displays a very low activity and selectivity and is therefore regarded to be inactive. After the first PDH cycle, the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts does not drop, verifying that the catalysts are not deactivated. In fact, for the GaK, Ga, and 3Ga catalysts, the propane conversion even increases. This implies that these catalysts require an activation period, related to the exposure to oxygen at 750C. Indeed, by treating the catalyst with oxygen at 750C prior to the first propane dehydrogenation cycle, the conversion is increased from 14.7 to 20.5% for the GaK catalyst. Treating the GaK catalyst at 620C under air prior to reaction has a lower impact and the conversion is only 18.5% for the first propane dehydrogenation cycle. Apparently, the high temperature during the regeneration is required for the Ga to remain active in the PDH process.</p>
<p>In addition to the catalytic tests discussed in Figure1 and Table1, a long-term stability test consisting of approximately 150 cycles or 14days of operation, was performed on the very active Pt3GaK catalyst. The catalytic performance of the catalyst during this experiment is shown in Figure2. It was found that the PDH activity drops significantly during the first two days of testing, after which the catalyst performance remained stable during a twelve-day evaluation period, giving a propane conversion of 31.1% and a selectivity for propene of 92.6%, stressing the high stability of the catalyst material.</p>
<p>After the eighth cycle, the catalyst materials were not regenerated, but instead collected from the reactor and analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with on-line mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the coke deposits formed. The change of weight per temperature interval as a function of temperature is shown in FigureS5. In addition, during the combustion a distinct CO2 profile is observed for each catalyst by on-line MS analysis, which is shown in FigureS6. These profiles accurately describe the temperature where coke is combusted, which is between 300650C; the weight loss corresponding with this temperature interval is included in Table1. The amount of CO2 detected is very small for the catalyst containing only Pt, for the bare support, and for the catalysts containing K. Less coke is therefore deposited on these catalysts, in agreement with what was observed with operando UV/Vis spectroscopy. On the other hand, the absence of K and the presence of Ga results in significant amounts of coke on the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>Because metallic Ga is a liquid and Ga2O a volatile compound, it is important to consider the reducibility of Ga3+, especially because the dehydrogenation reaction is performed at high temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. Alternatively, a PtGa alloy may be formed by hydrogen spillover from the Pt, whereby Ga3+ is reduced to Ga0, which then forms the alloy.7,14 TPR and quasi-insitu XPS was employed to investigate the reducibility of the 3Ga and Pt3Ga catalysts. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiment showed that no hydrogen was being consumed while the catalyst was heated up to 700C under a constant hydrogen flow (FigureS8). For the XPS experiment, the catalyst was reduced in a reactor, after which it was loaded into the XPS apparatus without being exposed to air. Again, no reduced Ga species were detected (FigureS9).</p>

The addition of alkali metals like potassium (K) enhances propene selectivity and reduces coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts. The bare support demonstrates low activity and selectivity, indicating its inactivity. Exposure to oxygen at 750°C activates the catalysts, leading to an increase in propane conversion. A long-term stability test reveals that the Pt3GaK catalyst maintains stable performance over 14 days with a propane conversion of 31.1% and a propene selectivity of 92.6%. After the eighth cycle, the catalysts show some deactivation, but the presence of K helps maintain the catalyst's activity. The reducibility tests indicate that Ga3+ is not easily reduced under the conditions of the dehydrogenation reaction, suggesting that a PtGa alloy is unlikely to form.

添加碱金属如钾（K）可以提高丙烯选择性并减少焦炭沉积，通过毒化PDH催化剂中的Brnsted酸位点。裸露的支撑材料表现出低活性和选择性，表明其无活性。暴露于750°C的氧气可以激活催化剂，导致丙烷转化率增加。长期稳定性测试显示，Pt3GaK催化剂在14天内保持稳定的性能，丙烷转化率为31.1%，丙烯选择性为92.6%。在第八轮循环后，催化剂显示出一定的失活，但钾的存在有助于维持催化剂的活性。可还原性测试表明，在脱氢反应条件下，Ga3+不易还原，暗示PtGa合金不太可能形成。
