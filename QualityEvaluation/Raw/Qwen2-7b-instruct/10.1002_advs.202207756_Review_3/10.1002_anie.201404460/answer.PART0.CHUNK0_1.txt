[1] "A catalyst material consisting of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina has been presented."
[2] "We observed a synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst."
[3] "A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as a promoter."
[4] "Details of the catalyst characterization (X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX), and N2-physisorption) are given in the Supporting Information."
[5] "From these characterization data it is concluded that all the compounds are homogeneously and highly dispersed on the catalyst materials as there is no evidence for the presence of crystalline nanoparticles."
[6] "The catalytic performance of the prepared materials has been tested in a lab-scale reactor for eight successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[7] "Both Pt and Ga are required to obtain a highly active, selective, and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[8] "The catalysts show somewhat higher values for conversion at the start of a dehydrogenation cycle, which then slowly drop during the 15min cycle."
[9] "The presence of K results in less darkening of the catalyst material, due to less coke being deposited."
[10] "The specific nature of the gallium species present on the catalyst was investigated by collecting 71Ga MAS NMR (magic-angle spinning NMR) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra of the fresh Pt3Ga and 3Ga catalysts."
[11] "In the NMR spectra, two peaks with chemical shifts of 151 and 15ppm are observed (relative to the signal of Ga(NO3)3), corresponding to tetrahedrally (IV) and octahedrally (VI) coordinated Ga3+, respectively."
[12] "On the contrary, the apparent concentration of Pt is high on the surface (1.3wt% observed versus 1000ppm), suggesting that the Pt is well dispersed on the surface."
[13] "A combination of structural, morphological, and surface characterization reveals a complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character originating from the supported Ga and Pt moieties, with Ga performing the actual dehydrogenation reaction and Pt being a unique promoting element."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the structure of the catalyst. These relationships reveal that a higher concentration of Ga species leads to more active gallium hydrides, enhancing the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The synergy between Ga and Pt results in a highly active and stable catalyst, with Ga functioning as the active dehydrogenation species and Pt serving as a promoter. The homogeneous dispersion of Ga and Pt ensures effective dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles. The addition of K to the Pt and Ga containing catalysts increases propene selectivity and decreases coke deposition, indicating a positive impact on the catalyst's stability and efficiency. The detailed characterization methods, including XRD, TEM-EDX, and N2-physisorption, confirm the presence of active gallium species and the successful incorporation of metals onto the support material. The observed trends in the conversion and selectivity over dehydrogenation cycles highlight the catalyst's ability to maintain high activity and selectivity, even after multiple regeneration steps. The presence of Pt in the catalyst material affects the distribution and coordination state of Ga species, contributing to the catalyst's enhanced performance. The complex structure of the catalyst, with its synergistic and bifunctional character, originates from the interaction between the supported Ga and Pt moieties, with Ga playing a crucial role in dehydrogenation and Pt acting as an efficient promoter.
