[1] "A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as a promoter."
[2] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."
[3] "A combination of structural, morphological, and surface characterization reveals a complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character originating from the supported Ga and Pt moieties, with Ga performing the actual dehydrogenation reaction and Pt being a unique promoting element."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. The synergy between Ga and Pt leads to a complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character, where Ga performs the actual dehydrogenation reaction and Pt acts as a promoter. This relationship reveals structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions, indicating that the specific ratios and densities affect the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.

在Ga修饰沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和框架铝对数影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物。Ga与Pt之间的协同作用导致了一个复杂催化剂材料，具有协同和双功能特性，其中Ga执行实际的脱氢反应，而Pt作为促进剂发挥作用。这种关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构活性相关性，表明特定的比例和密度会影响催化剂的反应性和稳定性。
