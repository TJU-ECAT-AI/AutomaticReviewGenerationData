The kinetics of the consecutive H–D exchange reactions between
methane and deuterated acid FAU- and MFI-type zeolites was stud-
ied with on-line mass spectrometric product analysis, in the temper-
ature range 450 to 550◦C. On both zeolite types, the rate constant of
H–D exchange increases with decreasing Al content. At the same Al
content, the reaction rate constant of MFI is ca. three times larger
than that of FAU, showing that chemical composition and struc-
tural effects are important in determining the rate of exchange.
The apparent activation energy is in the range 122–150 kJ/mol, in-
dependent of the Al content and structure type. A kinetic isotope
effectofapproximately1.7wasfound,whichisindisagreementwith
the earlier proposed concerted reaction mechanism (G. J. Kramer,

INTRODUCTION
Bridging hydroxyl groups of the type Al–OH–Si are the
active sites of acid zeolite catalysts (2–4). The Brønsted
acid strength of these bridging hydroxyls is dependent on
the structure type and framework composition. Thus, max-
imum acid strength is reached when the bridging hydroxyl
is isolated, i.e., without Al atoms being present in next-
nearest-neighbor (NNN) positions in the framework (5, 6).
This NNN principle is based on spectroscopic and cata-
lytic observations. The O1–H stretching vibration in FAU
zeolites is shifted from 3660 cm−1 for a Si/Al ratio of 1.25 to
3610cm−1forSi/Alratios≥8,andthe 1Hchemicalshiftfrom
4.0 to 4.7 ppm (7, 8). These changes are thought to reﬂect
the increase in acid strength with increasing Si/Al ratio. In
the cracking of hexane over a series of dealuminated Y
zeolites, maximum activity is obtained for a zeolite with
30 Al atoms per unit cell or a Si/Al ratio of 5.4 (9, 10). In
the cracking of hexane over ZSM-5, the activity per site
is constant over a wide range, reﬂecting the uniformity of

the acid sites when they are highly diluted in the zeolite
(11).
Over the last few years, H–D exchange reactions of small
alkanes have been used to gain insight into the mechanisms
of alkane conversions over acid zeolites (12–17). Two essen-
tially different reaction mechanisms have been proposed.
The bimolecular route consists of a hydride transfer from
the incoming alkane to an adsorbed alkyl carbenium ion
(18, 19). In the monomolecular route, a proton is added to
the alkane, with the formation of an alkyl carbonium ion
(20–23).
Hydrogen–deuterium exchange between methane and
an acid zeolite is a model reaction that attracted much at-
tention from a theoretical viewpoint (24, 25). A concerted
reaction mechanism was proposed (1, 26), in which the hy-
drogen atom of the bridging hydroxyl group moves towards
the methane carbon atom, while at the same time, a deu-
terium atom from methane (CD4) moves towards an oxy-
gen atom of the zeolite. The reaction coordinate is almost
along the lines connecting the O–H–C and C–D–O atoms.
The transition state is obtained when the H and D atoms are
halfway between the oxygen and carbon atoms. Using this
transition state and a H3Si–O–Al(OH)2–OH–SiH3 cluster,
representing the zeolite, the activation energy for the reac-
tionwascalculatedtobe150 ± 20kJ/mol.Theexchangerate
was theoretically predicted using Eyring’s transition state
theory and found to be in reasonable agreement with the
experimental rates determined with in situ infrared spec-
troscopy.
When the transition state of the concerted reaction mech-
anism is frozen into the FAU and MFI structures, the inﬂu-
ence of chemical composition (Si/Al ratio) and structure
(MFI vs FAU) can be studied with the electronegativity
equalization method (EEM) (27, 28). This is a semiempiri-
cal density functional (DFT) method that requires two pa-
rameters for each atom type and exact knowledge of the
structure, i.e., the coordinates of the atoms in the structure.
They can be generated by the distance-least-squares (DLS)
method. It follows from these calculations that Al in NNN
positions hampers the reaction and that the inﬂuence of Al

content or chemical composition is more important by one
order of magnitude than that of structure type (29, 30).
In this paper the H–D exchange reaction between
methane and deuterated FAU- and MFI-type zeolites was
studied experimentally in a recirculation reactor using on-
line monitoring of the reaction products with a mass spec-
trometer. The goals of this study were to establish structural
(FAU vs MFI) and chemical (Si/Al ratio) effects on the
reaction kinetics and to validate results of the theoretical
calculations based on a concerted reaction mechanism.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Zeolites
The USY-type zeolites CBV712, CBV720, and CBV780
and the ZSM-5 zeolites CBV3020, CBV5020, and CBV8020
were from PQ (Table 1) and used as received. A detailed
characterization of these samples is provided by Remy et al.
(31). The sample Y1 was from Zeocat; the Y2 sample was
a gift from Exxon Chemical Europe.
The number of acid sites on dry zeolite weight basis was
calculated from the Si/Al ratios of Table 1, assuming all Al
atoms to be in lattice positions, except when stated differ-
ently. Zeolite samples in NH+
4 and H+ form were used as
such. NH+
4 exchange of the Na+ zeolites was performed
in NH4Cl solutions with 10-fold excess of NH+
4 with re-
spect to the cation exchange capacity at a solid : liquid ratio
of 1 g/dm3. The samples were exchanged overnight under
continuous stirring and washed with bidistilled water until
Cl−free. The procedure was repeated three times, to ensure
maximum exchange. After washing, the samples were dried
at 60◦C and stored over a saturated CaCl2 solution.
For the catalytic experiments, the proton and ammonium
exchanged zeolites were activated in an oxygen ﬂow at
500◦C for 8 h. The heating rate was 4◦C per minute.

H–D Exchange Experiments
The catalytic experiments were performed in a recircu-
lation reactor, connected via a variable leak to a MD800
mass spectrometer from Interscience. The capillary leak is
constructed from an inox tubing with an internal diameter
of 0.01 in. The ﬂow through the capillary was adjusted to
0.6 ml min−1 with a needle valve at the beginning of the
transfer line. The capillary leak is situated in the center of
the batch volume to ensure representative sampling. The
capillary is heated to 120◦C and ﬂushed with He to remove
all traces of molecules (mainly adsorbed water) that might
interfere with detection of the methane isotopomers. By
switching the transfer line between the reactor and the He
feed, it was found that the response time of the transfer line
was only a few seconds.
When the catalyst is brought into the reactor, it is ﬁrst
deuterated with a D2O saturated He ﬂow at 200◦C for
120 min. After deuteration, all remaining water was re-
moved by calcining the sample in a He ﬂow at 500◦C for
1 h. The catalyst was then brought to reaction tempera-
ture and the reactor was evacuated. After evacuation, the
desired amounts of helium and methane were added. The
amount of methane was controlled via its partial pressure
in the reactor. All experiments were performed at a total
pressure of 1000 mbar. The reactor was ﬁrst operated in
bypass mode, to obtain a good mixture of methane and he-
lium. During this bypass operation, there was no contact
between methane and the catalyst. This allowed determi-
nation of the background signal (mainly H2O at m/z = 18
and m/z = 17) and the methane fragmentation pattern. This
fragmentation pattern was necessary for further analysis of
the experimental data. The gas mixture was circulated by
a membrane pump at the rate of 2 liters min−1 to ensure
complete mixing of reagents and products.
Five reaction temperatures between 450 and 550◦C were
chosen, together with three methane concentrations be-
tween 0.5 and 2% methane in helium. The methane concen-
tration was kept under 2% to keep the amount of methane
hydrogen atoms at the same order of magnitude as the
amount of deuterium atoms present on the zeolite surface.
The upper limit of the reaction temperature was set by
the onset of methane pyrolysis and the lower temperature
limit by the duration of the experiment. At a leak rate of
0.6 ml/min and a total reactor volume of 1340 ml, the to-
tal duration of the experiment should not be longer than
200 min, to keep the amount of products lost for analysis
under 10% of the initial amount. During the reaction, the
m/z = 2–50 range was scanned with a scan time of 0.45 s and
a delay of 9.55 s between two successive scans.
The infrared measurements were performed on a Nicolet
730 FT-IR spectrometer, equipped with a DTGS detector
and 100 scans were accumulated for one spectrum at a res-
olution of 0.9 cm−1. The samples were pressed into thin
self-supporting wafers and placed in the high-temperature

IR cell. This IR cell with CaF2 windows allows measure-
ments at temperatures up to 580◦C. The sample can be ex-
posed to different gases and the cell can also be evacuated.
RESULTS
Deuteration of the Zeolites
To make H exchange reactions accessible to experimen-
tal investigation, it is necessary to label the reactant or the
catalyst with deuterium. When the fragmentation of the re-
actant molecule has to be taken into account, it is often
easier to use deuterated catalysts. For example in the case
of the H exchange of methane with a deuterated catalyst,
the isotopomers of methane at m/z = 16–20 can be moni-
tored without interference of the fragmentation peaks at
m/z = 12–15. When deuterated methane is used instead,
elaborate corrections are necessary to make the distinc-
tion between the molecular ion peaks of the different iso-
topomers and the intense fragmentation peaks at m/z = 16
and m/z = 18.
The deuteration is based on a procedure described by
Mota et al. (20). It gives samples that are fully deuterated
without loss of framework Al or crystallinity. This was ver-
iﬁed with infrared spectroscopy. The OH stretching vibra-
tions of the bridging hydroxyl groups and the silanol groups
(3500–3800 cm−1 region) decrease progressively, while new
absorption bands grow in the 2600–2800 cm−1 region. These
new bands are the O–D stretching vibrations of the bridging
hydroxyl and silanol groups. When, after 60 min, the O–H
stretching vibrations have disappeared, complete deutera-
tion has been achieved.
Subsequently, the sample was contacted with a mixture
of 2% CH4 in N2 at 500◦C and at given times, the IR cell was
evacuated and a spectrum was recorded. This allows the re-
action of CH4 with the surface O–D groups to be monitored
and the results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1. As
the contact time between the zeolite and methane increases,
O–H stretching vibrational bands are formed at 3550, 3630,
and 3740 cm−1, while the O–D bands gradually decrease at
2620, 2670, and 2750 cm−1. Thus, bridging hydroxyl groups
(2620 and 2670 cm−1) as well as silanol groups (2750 cm−1)
are available for H–D exchange with methane.
H–D Exchange Kinetics
Spectral corrections.
The isotopomers of methane,
CH4−xDx with x = 0–4, have their own characteristic frag-
mentation patterns, which overlap each other. To obtain
the pure molecular ion peaks of the methane isotopomers,
corrections have to be made for the fragmentation peaks
that contribute to the m/z signals.
Thereactant,methaneinHe,isrunoverabypasstodeter-
mine its fragmentation pattern (Eq. [7]). With this pattern
and with the hypothesis that the degree of fragmentation
of the isotopomers is identical, Eqs. [1]–[6] are obtained,
relating mass spectrometer signals to concentrations:

[7]
The application of these equations gives the disappear-
ance of CH4 and the formation of CH3D, CH2D2, CHD3,
and CD4 as a function of time. This type of correction
can also be extended to the m/z = 15 signal. Obviously,
the resulting [m/z = 15]corr will approximate zero, since it
consists entirely of fragmentation peaks. The approach of
the corrected m/z = 15 signal to zero is an indication for the
quality of the correction. In our experiments, the absolute
intensity of the corrected m/z = 15 signal was always less
than 5% of the original m/z = 15 signal, conﬁrming the
validity of the proposed data treatment.
Kinetic analysis.
Initially, the rate of transfer of deu-
terium from the zeolite to methane equals the rate of H
exchange, since every exchange reaction results in the trans-
fer of one deuterium atom. After some time, however, the
deuterium atoms that are now present on the methane will
also exchange. The exchange of deuterium on methane with
deuterium on the zeolite cannot be observed. Exchange of
deuterium of methane with a proton of the zeolite leads
even to a deuterium transfer from methane to the zeolite.
Thus, while the overall exchange rate remains constant, the
apparent deuterium transfer rate will decrease with time
and eventually become zero when equilibrium is achieved.
The hydrogen exchange reaction between methane and
an acid zeolite and the general form of the rate equa-
tion are expressed in Eq. [8] (Y represents the zeolite).
Similarly, for the hydrogen–deuterium exchange reaction

between methane and a deuterated zeolite, the initial reac-
tion and the exchange rate R can be written as in Eq. [9].
At any given time t after the start of the reaction, the over-
all exchange rate R is made up of the sum of the exchange
rates of 16 subreactions that are all occurring at their own
speciﬁc rates. These 16 subreactions with their respective
rate expressions, R1–R16, are presented in the Appendix.

Experimentally only the transfer of deuterium from the
zeolite to methane can be observed. The amount of deu-
terium X transferred from the zeolite to methane at time
t equals the total amount of deuterium present on the
methane or the total amount of hydrogen present on the ze-
olite (Eq. [10]). The mathematical expression for the trans-
fer of deuterium from the zeolite to the methane fraction,
in terms of the rates of the 16 subreactions, is presented in

The results of an experiment with a mixture of 0.5%
methane in helium and 1.5 g of a CBV5020 (H-ZSM-5
with Si/Al = 25) catalyst at 500◦C are presented in Fig. 2.
It shows the evolution with time of the m/z = 16–20 signals.
After spectral correction (Eqs. [1]–[7]) Fig. 3 is obtained.
The methane signal decreases with time and gives rise to
consecutive formation of deuterated products. The over-
all exchange rate can be calculated from the slope of the
straight line that is obtained when ln(8eq −8) is plotted

versus time (Fig. 4). The exchange rate per site is obtained
by dividing the overall exchange rate by the number of sites,
which is deﬁned as the number of Al atoms, assuming that
all Al is in the lattice.
To correlate these reaction rate data with the zeolite
properties, it is necessary to verify the absence of any in-
termolecular H–D exchange of methane in the gas phase.
Blank experiments in an empty reactor tube, performed
with a 50 : 50 mixture of CH4 and CD4, showed that at tem-
peratures up to 580◦C no measurable exchange occurs be-
tween CH4 and CD4.
The exchange rates per site for a series of FAU-type ze-
olites with different Si/Al ratios are presented in Fig. 5 as
a function of the Al/(Si + Al) ratio of the zeolites. The ex-
periments were performed with a mixture of 1% CH4 in He
and temperatures of 450, 475, and 500◦C. These data clearly
indicate that the exchange rate per site decreases with in-
creasing number of Al atoms per unit cell and tends to level
off at low as well as at high Al content. When the same ex-
periments are performed with a series of MFI-type zeolites
(Fig. 6), the same trends are observed, but the leveling off
takes place only at Al/(Al + Si) below 0.025 or Si/Al ratios
above 40. For the most siliceous samples, the exchange rate
per site even decreases below Al/(Si + Al) = 0.025. ZSM-5
samples with Si/Al ratios below 12 were not available to
verify the behavior at higher acid site densities.
The exchange rates for the MFI- and FAU-type catalysts
at 500◦C and 1% CH4 in He are compared in Fig. 7. These
data show that at the same Al/(Si + Al) ratio, the exchange
rate for MFI-type zeolites is higher than that for FAU-type

mining the activity per site.
Remy et al. made a quantitative analysis of the differ-
ent Al species in the FAU samples by 29Si and 27Al MAS
NMR. They considered the following Al species: Al(IV)
or tetrahedral framework Al, Al(VI) or octahedral extra-
framework Al; Al(x) is an Al species that belongs to the

framework and Al(I) is NMR-invisible Al, which accounts
for the difference in Al content determined by chemical
analysis and 27Al NMR. If bridging hydroxyls are associ-
ated with Al(IV) only, as determined by NMR, than the
activity per site is higher as shown by the full triangles of
Fig. 7. However, the general trend of an increase in activity
with decreasing Al/(Si + Al) ratio remains valid.

For both FAU- and MFI-type zeolites, experiments were

H–D exchange reaction was calculated using the Arrhenius
equation. The experimental values for the apparent activa-
tion energy were found to be in the range of 122–150 kJ/mol

tio. To obtain the true activation energy, the adsorption en-
ergy of methane, which is around −15 kJ/mol on both FAU
and MFI type zeolites (32–34), has to be accounted for. This
results in a true activation energy of 137–165 kJ/mol.
In addition, experiments were performed using deuter-
ated methane (CD4) and a H+-zeolite. Now, the decrease in
the amount of CD4 (m/z = 20) and the increase in CHD3,
CH2D2, CH3D, and CH4 signals is followed as a function

of time. The experimental data are treated analogously to
those of the exchange between CH4 and D+-zeolites. The
results show that the exchange rate with CD4 is higher than
that of CH4. This is indicative for a kinetic isotope effect,
represented as kH/kD, where kH is the rate constant for the
exchange between CD4 and H+-zeolites and kD is the rate
constant for the exchange between CH4 and D+-zeolites.
The ratio kH/kD for MFI-type zeolites is 1.6–1.7 (Table 3).
Modeling of the Reaction Kinetics
The H–D exchange between methane and Brønsted acid
sites can be modeled by a consecutive reaction (CH4 →
CH3D →CH2D2 →CHD3 →CD4). A consecutive mecha-
nism implies that the adsorption and desorption are fast
compared with the exchange reaction. A single methane
molecule will adsorb and desorb multiple times before it
will undergo an exchange reaction.

The model uses the 16 possible exchange reactions be-
tween methane and the zeolite as a starting point (see Ap-
pendix). These 16 reactions are subdivided into ﬁve groups,
representing the ﬁve different isotopomers of methane,
based on whether they take part in the formation or
disappearance of that respective isotopomer. Using the
rate equations of the 16 subreactions, one obtains a sys-
tem of ﬁve differential equations, representing the forma-
tion and disappearance of the ﬁve isotopomers. For ex-
ample in the case of the isotopomer CH3D, d[CH3D]/

These equations were solved with the mathematical soft-
ware package MAPLEV Release4, using a fourth- and ﬁfth-
order Runge–Kutta method.
For a boundary condition equivalent to an experiment
with a CBV5020 and 0.5% methane, this system was solved
and a graphical representation is given in Fig. 8. The results
from the modeling correspond well with the experimental
data, indicating that a consecutive exchange mechanism is
a good model to describe the experimental data. The fact
that a heterogeneous catalyzed H–D exchange reaction can
be described with a simple model for a gas-phase reaction
indicates that the reaction is the rate-determining step. That
there is no single-step perdeuteration can also be seen from
the low initial intensity of mass 20 in the chromatogram.
DISCUSSION
The Zeolites
The H–D exchange of methane on H-form zeolites is an
acid-catalyzed reaction that neatly runs without side reac-
tions in the temperature frame 450–550◦C. Therefore, it is a
good reaction to test structure–activity relationships and to

experimentally observe the effects of chemical composition
on activity. Ideally, this would require the use of “perfect”
catalysts containing only bridging hydroxyls, all the Al in
tetrahedral coordination in the lattice, no defects, and ab-
sence of silanols. Real catalysts contain some extra-lattice
Al and defect sites such as silanols.
Silanol groups are considered weakly acidic or nonacidic.
Do they take part in the reaction? Under the conditions of
the present experiments, no exchange was observed on sil-
ica. However, in the IR cell, silanols of zeolites are deuter-
ated and take part in the exchange reaction with methane
(Fig. 1). Thus, either the silanols of silica have a different
reactivity from those of zeolites, or under the exchange con-
ditions the various hydroxyl groups form one pool of hy-
drogens on the surface.
Bridging hydroxyls are associated with structural Al,
which is in tetrahedral coordination. Other types of Al
might also be associated with hydroxyl groups. However,
they are not well characterized and their acidity is un-
known. We have therefore taken either the total Al content
or the tetrahedral Al content to calculate the activity per
site. The data on FAU in Fig. 7 indicate that the general
trend of activity increase with decreasing Al/(Si + Al) ratio
does not change. On the other hand, there is no correlation
between the activity per site and the amount of extra-lattice
Al, with an NMR signal characteristic of octahedral Al. It is
concludedthattheH–DexchangebetweenCH4anddeuter-
ated zeolites is a Brønsted acid-catalyzed reaction. Total as
well as tetrahedral Al can be used to estimate the number
of active sites from which the activity per site is obtained.
Reaction Mechanism
The H–D exchange reaction is a stepwise reaction,
wherein a CH4 molecule exchanges one H at a time with
the D of a bridging deuteroxyl group. Thus, CH3D, CH2D2,
CHD3, and CD4 are formed consecutively. Both the exper-
imental results and the modeling conﬁrm this picture. The
transition state is a penta-coordinated carbonium ion with
one H and one D in interaction with two neighboring oxy-
gens of the zeolite lattice:
The experimental values of the activation energy (137–
165 kJ/mol) are in good agreement with the theoretical
value of 150 ± 20 kJ/mol that was calculated based on
a concerted reaction mechanism. A concerted reaction
mechanism means that the transition state of the reac-
tion CH4 + ≡Al–OD–Si≡is exactly the same as that of
CD4 + ≡Al–OH–Si≡. This holds true if the following two
hypotheses are valid: (1) the two oxygens of the lattice tak-
ing part in the reaction must be crystallographically equiv-
alent; (2) the reaction coordinate contains the atoms O–D–
C–H–O only. No kinetic isotope effect will be measured.
The experimentally observed kinetic isotope effect of 1.7
indicates that the concerted reaction mechanism is invalid.
For a reaction in the FAU supercages the two structural
oxygens taking part in the reaction are O1 and O4. Further-
more, the theoretically calculated intrinsic reaction coordi-
nate contains a small contribution from the CH3 fragment
of methane (29). The reason for the theoretically proposed
concerted mechanism is that in the theoretical calculations
a mirror plane was imposed on the transition state (1, 26).
When it is removed, preliminary calculations at the AM1
level show that the reaction does not occur via a concerted
mechanism (35).
Structure–Activity Relationships
The ultimate goal of catalysis research is the establish-
ment of the relation between structure and composition of
a catalyst, on one hand, and activity and selectivity of the re-
action it catalyzes, on the other hand. In the case of the H–D
exchange of methane with acid zeolites, selectivity effects
are absent and structure/composition–activity relationships
can be discussed.
According to the NNN principle, a constant maximum
activity per site is expected when the bridging hydroxyls or
lattice Al are separated by at least two Si tetrahedra (5, 6,
29). Such a phenomenon is observed for MFI (Fig. 6) and
for FAU (Fig. 5). For FAU, maximum activity is reached at
a Si/Al ratio of about 15 or Al/(Si + Al) = 0.06. Such a value
is in agreement with the NNN principle and the statement
thatAlatomsatalongermutualdistancehavenosigniﬁcant
inﬂuence on activity. For MFI, maximum activity per site is
reached only at Si/Al = 40 or Al/(Si + Al) = 0.024.
If a random distribution of Al is assumed, the Si/Al ratios
of 15 and 40 correspond to 1.2 and 2.2 nm3/Al in the FAU
and MFI frameworks, respectively. Thus, the distance be-
tween Al tetrahedra necessary to obtain a constant activity
per site is larger in MFI than in FAU. This can be related to
the higher T-atom density of MFI (17.9 T/1000 ˚
A3) than that
of FAU (12.7 T/1000 ˚
A3) (36). The conclusion is that struc-
ture (density of T atoms) and chemical composition (NNN
principle) determine the activity per site. The same param-
eters determine the acid strength of the bridging hydroxyls.
Thus, both for FAU and for MFI the acid strength increases
with decreasing Al/(Si + Al) ratio. The acid strength of the
bridging hydroxyl of MFI is higher than that of the bridg-
ing hydroxyl in FAU. One can then use the activity per site
in the H–D exchange as a measure of acidity of bridging
hydroxyl groups.
Theoretical calculations tend to indicate that local prop-
erties of the active site are more important than long-range
effects. Local properties are usually related to chemical

composition, long-range effects to structure. Our results
show that chemical composition and structure are both im-
portant and cannot be separated.
To reﬁne the relative importance of chemical composi-
tion and structure, additional experiments have to be de-
signed to reveal the inﬂuence of silanol groups, defects, and
impurities on the reaction under study. From the theoretical
viewpoint powerful ab initio methods must be available to
study structural effects. Up to now these structural effects
can be taken into account with the EEM method only. How-
ever, one has to calculate theoretically a transition state
and freeze it in the zeolite to perform such EEM calcula-
tions. Structure relaxation is not accounted for in the EEM
calculations.
CONCLUSIONS
Both structure and composition determine the activity
of the bridging hydroxyl group in the H–D exchange re-
action with methane over acid aluminosilicate zeolites of
FAU and MFI structure type. A composition effect is evi-
denced in the change of the activity per site with changing
Al content. A constant and maximum activity per site is
observed in FAU samples with Si/Al ratio exceeding 15, as
predicted by the NNN principle. For MFI, constant activity
is reached only at Si/Al above 40. The structural effect is ev-
idenced by the much higher activity of a bridging hydroxyl
in MFI than in FAU zeolites. The observed kinetic isotope
effect is in disagreementwithH–Dexchangeproceedingvia
a concerted reaction mechanism. The apparent activation
energies of 122–150 kJ/mol, independent of structure and
chemical composition, do agree with a previously reported
theoretical value of 150 kJ/mol (1). The inﬂuence of silanol
groups, defects, and impurities remains to be investigated
in more detail to reﬁne the presently observed composition
and structure effects.
APPENDIX
Sixteen exchange reactions can occur between the bridg-
ing hydroxyl groups of a zeolite and the isotopomers of
methane, CH4, CH3D, CH2D2, CHD3, and CD4. The re-
spective rate equations can be expressed as fractions of the
global exchange rate R. The global exchange rate R is the
sum of the exchange rates of the 16 subreactions.
