<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships indicate how the catalyst's structure correlates with its activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
