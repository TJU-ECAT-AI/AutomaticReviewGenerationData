[1] "Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction40. However, undesired side reactions that occur during the alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis,isomerization and coke formation, are structure sensitive reac- tions, requiring more than one Pt atom41."
[2] "It is worth noting that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state41."
[3] "Xiong et al. reported that single Pt atoms on CeO2 can only promote the cleavage of CC bonds of hydrocarbons with no observed selec- tivity toward dehydrogenation42. Therefore, SAAs attract our attention, where the catalytically active metal is atomically dis- persed in the surface layer of the more inert host metal and exists in the metallic state, distinguishing from single atoms positively charged on metal oxides26,43."
[4] "The deep dehydrogenation thus becomes strongly endothermic over Pt/Cu SAA with a significant free energy barrier (>2 eV),compared with the same step over Pt(111) with a surmountable barrier (<1 eV), leading to a much higher propylene selectivity over Pt/Cu SAA (Fig. 1d)."
[5] "DFT results also identify that the exposed isolated surface Pt atoms within Cu(111) facets of Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles (larger than 2.1 nm in diameter) are thermodynamically more stable than other types of Pt species: (1) isolated subsurface Pt atoms,(2) single Pt atoms within Cu(100) facets, (3) single Pt atoms at low coordinated step edge and corner sites, and (4) surface dimers within Cu(111) (Supplementary Tables 24)."
[6] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (Fig. 1b)."
[7] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[8] "The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g1Pt h1 is presented (dash line)."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts do not seem to be directly addressed in the provided literature. The focus is on the synthesis and characterization of Pt/Cu single atom alloys for propane dehydrogenation. No information is provided regarding how these specific zeolite properties correlate with the formation and nature of active gallium species, or their impact on the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Answer: The literature does not provide information on how the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, or reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
