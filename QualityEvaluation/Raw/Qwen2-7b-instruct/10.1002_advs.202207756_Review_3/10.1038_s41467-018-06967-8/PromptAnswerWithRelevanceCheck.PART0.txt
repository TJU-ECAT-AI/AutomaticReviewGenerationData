[1] "Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction40. However, undesired side reactions that occur during the alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis,isomerization and coke formation, are structure sensitive reac- tions, requiring more than one Pt atom41."
[2] "It is worth noting that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state41."
[3] "Xiong et al. reported that single Pt atoms on CeO2 can only promote the cleavage of CC bonds of hydrocarbons with no observed selec- tivity toward dehydrogenation42. Therefore, SAAs attract our attention, where the catalytically active metal is atomically dis- persed in the surface layer of the more inert host metal and exists in the metallic state, distinguishing from single atoms positively charged on metal oxides26,43."
[4] "The deep dehydrogenation thus becomes strongly endothermic over Pt/Cu SAA with a significant free energy barrier (>2 eV),compared with the same step over Pt(111) with a surmountable barrier (<1 eV), leading to a much higher propylene selectivity over Pt/Cu SAA (Fig. 1d)."
[5] "DFT results also identify that the exposed isolated surface Pt atoms within Cu(111) facets of Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles (larger than 2.1 nm in diameter) are thermodynamically more stable than other types of Pt species: (1) isolated subsurface Pt atoms,(2) single Pt atoms within Cu(100) facets, (3) single Pt atoms at low coordinated step edge and corner sites, and (4) surface dimers within Cu(111) (Supplementary Tables 24)."
[6] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (Fig. 1b)."
[7] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."

[2] "It is worth noting that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state41."
[3] "Such SAAs have been widely used as a strategy for selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the selective hydrogenation of styrene, acetylene, and 1,3-butadiene26,29."
[4] "Recently, Pt/Cu SAAs were suggested as an approach to coke-resistant CH activation chemistry and exam- ined in the systems of methyl groups, methane, butane, and propane37."
[5] "However, no stable SAA under reducing environment at high temperatures (>400 C) has been reported so far."
[6] "This raises the question whether SAAs are capable of breaking the restriction of the scaling relationship for PtM alloys and cata- lyzing dehydrogenation reactions at high temperatures stably."
[7] "Due to the existence of the scaling relationship for Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals), low dehydrogenation barrier (i.e., high PDH activity) accompanies with strong CPt interaction, leading to strong propene adsorption (i.e., low propene selectivity) (Fig. 1a)."
[8] "However, isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu nanoparticles maintain a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time display a quite high selectivity, which is reflected by the low binding strength of propylene and high deep dehydrogenation barrier (Fig. 1a)."
[9] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (Fig. 1b)."
[10] "The binding strength of π adsorbed propylene over Pt/Cu SAA (0.57 eV) is also weaker than the di- σ ones over Pt3Cu(111) (0.88 eV) and Pt(111) (1.10 eV),further facilitating propylene desorption over Pt/Cu SAA."
[11] "The exposed isolated surface Pt atoms within Cu(111) facets of Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles (larger than 2.1 nm in diameter) are thermodynamically more stable than other types of Pt species."
[12] "Therefore, isolated Pt atoms within Cu(111) facets are thermodynamically preferred in the case with high Cu to Pt molar ratio, which maximizes the utilization of Pt atoms."
[13] "For the catalysts after reduction, the diffraction line of Cu(111) becomes apparent as the content of Cu increases to 6.7 wt%, demonstrating the formation of Cu nanoparticles on alumina."
[14] "When treated under H2-rich condition at 600 C for 1 h, the oxide species of Pt and Cu on γ-alumina can be fully reduced since the highest reduction peak temperature for PtCu bimetallic catalysts is below 200 C."
[15] "For the catalysts after reduction, the diffraction line of Cu(111) becomes apparent as the content of Cu increases to 6.7 wt%, demonstrating the formation of Cu nanoparticles on alumina."
[16] "The lattice spacing of Pt/Cu SAA is 0.21 nm, which is in good consistence with the lattice spacing of Cu(111), indicating dilute dispersion of Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles."
[17] "Single Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles are repeatedly observed in different regions of the reduced 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, and no clusters or nanopar- ticles of Pt on γ-alumina are found."
[18] "In terms of Pt nanoparticles, the Pt nanoparticles are dispersed on γ-alumina with an average particle size of about 2.3 nm."
[19] "The coordination of Pt and Cu in monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtCu catalysts was revealed through in situ EXAFS performed at the Pt-LIII edge and CuK edge."
[20] "At the Pt-LIII edge, there are 6.8 PtCu bonds at 2.53 Å and no PtPt coordination is detected in the fully reduced 0.1Pt6.7Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, providing direct evidence for the isolated Pt atoms in the bimetallic PtCu catalysts at high Cu to Pt molar ratios."
[21] "The CH activation starts at about 188 C on Pt nanoparticles, 204 C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 C on Cu nanoparticles, respectively."
[22] "Moreover, according to the Pt dispersion (Supplementary Table 8) and the specific activity at 520 C (Supplementary Table 9), the calculated TOF is 0.72 s1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 and 0.56 s1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3."
[23] "During the PDH at 520 C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12 h on stream."
[24] "As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12 h on stream."
[25] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[26] "The initial activity of the catalyst can be largely restored after regeneration at 600 C."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the structure and reactivity of the catalyst. Higher Ga/Al ratios typically lead to greater incorporation of gallium into the zeolite framework, potentially enhancing the formation of gallium hydrides and improving the catalyst's activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The Si/Al ratio affects the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, which can influence the stability and distribution of gallium species. Higher Si/Al ratios might increase the basicity, which could affect the desorption of propylene and the further dehydrogenation barrier, thus impacting the selectivity towards propylene. Framework aluminum pair density is crucial for maintaining the pore structure and stability of the catalyst, which in turn affects the accessibility of reactants and products. Higher pair densities could improve the diffusion of reactants and products, contributing to the catalyst's performance. The specific relationships between these ratios and the nature of gallium species are complex and depend on the interplay between gallium incorporation, acidity/basicity, and pore structure. Detailed characterization techniques, such as in situ DRIFTS, EXAFS, and TEM, are used to elucidate these relationships and correlate them with the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
