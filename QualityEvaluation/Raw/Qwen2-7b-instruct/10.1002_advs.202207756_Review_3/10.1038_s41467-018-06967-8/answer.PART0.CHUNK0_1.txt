1. The ultimate goal of researchers in the development of catalysts is to achieve simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity.

2. The catalytic properties of PtM alloys are restricted by the scaling relationship, which leads to enhanced selectivity towards propylene but suppresses the intrinsic dehydrogenation activity of propane.

3. The scaling relationship between the first dehydrogenation barrier and propylene desorption barrier/deep dehydrogenation barrier for Pt3M alloy systems is illustrated.

4. The screening of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is presented.

5. The binding energy difference and structures of dehydrogenated intermediates C3Hx (where x = 7, 6, 5) over pure Pt surfaces and Pt/Cu SAA surfaces are provided.

6. Energy profiles of PDH over Pt/Cu SAA, Pt3Cu(111), and Pt(111) are shown.

7. The initial conversion of propane increases up to 6.7 wt% of Cu content and remains constant with further increase to 15 wt%.

8. The structure of Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina is confirmed through CO-DRIFTS, AC-HAADF-STEM images, and EXAFS spectra.

9. The lattice spacing of Pt/Cu SAA matches with that of Cu(111), indicating the dilute dispersion of Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles.

10. The thermodynamic conversion is presented as a function of time in moles per gram of Pt per hour.
