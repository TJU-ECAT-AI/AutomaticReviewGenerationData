[1] "Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction."
[2] "However, isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu nanoparticles maintain a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time display a quite high selectivity."
[3] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH."
[4] "Compared with Pt(111), Pt/Cu SAA only"
[5] "We simply synthesized the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina by means of atomic dilution."

1. The structure of the platinum particles does not significantly affect the dehydrogenation reaction of alkanes, as single atoms of platinum can effectively catalyze this process.
2. Isolated platinum atoms distributed on copper nanoparticles maintain a moderate dehydrogenation activation barrier while showing a high selectivity.
3. Our computational predictions demonstrate that the Pt/Cu SAA system breaks the scaling relationship for PtM alloys during propane dehydrogenation, unlike conventional Pt alloys.
4. The Pt/Cu SAA exhibits a slightly higher dehydrogenation barrier compared to Pt(111), but it still maintains a similar level of activity.
5. The Pt/Cu SAA catalysts were easily synthesized by applying an atomic dilution technique.
