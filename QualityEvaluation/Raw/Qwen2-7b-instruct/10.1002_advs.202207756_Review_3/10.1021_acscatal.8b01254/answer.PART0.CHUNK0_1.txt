[1] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density were varied to understand their impact on the formation and nature of active gallium species."
[2] "The results showed that increasing the Ga/Al ratio led to a higher concentration of gallium hydrides."
[3] "A higher Si/Al ratio was associated with a decreased formation of gallium hydrides."
[4] "Framework aluminum pair density had a moderate effect on the formation of gallium hydrides."
[5] "These relationships revealed strong structure-activity correlations in the propane dehydrogenation reactions."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. Increasing the Ga/Al ratio leads to a higher concentration of gallium hydrides, while a higher Si/Al ratio decreases their formation. Framework aluminum pair density moderately affects the formation of gallium hydrides. These relationships indicate strong structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对对对在Ga修饰沸石催化剂中显著影响活性镓物种，包括镓氢化物的形成和性质。提高Ga/Al比例导致镓氢化物浓度增加，而较高的Si/Al比例则减少了镓氢化物的形成。骨架铝对对对密度对形成镓氢化物有适度的影响。这些关系表明丙烷脱氢反应中的强结构-活性相关性。
