<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by determining the structure of the catalyst. These relationships indicate that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are significantly affected by the aforementioned parameters.
