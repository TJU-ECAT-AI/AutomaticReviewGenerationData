[1] "In this work, we study the role of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The results show that the Ga/Al ratio has a significant impact on the formation of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides."
[3] "The Si/Al ratio also plays a crucial role in determining the nature of these active species."
[4] "Furthermore, the framework aluminum pair density influences the structure-activity correlations in the catalyst."
[5] "These relationships suggest that optimizing these parameters can lead to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions."
