<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts play a crucial role in determining the formation and characteristics of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. These factors correlate closely with the structure-activity relationships observed during propane dehydrogenation reactions.
