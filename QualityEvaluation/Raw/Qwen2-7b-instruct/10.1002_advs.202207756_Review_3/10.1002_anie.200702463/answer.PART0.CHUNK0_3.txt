[1] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
[2] "For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."
[3] "However, Table2 shows that the energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom."
[4] "We propose that multinuclear Ga sites are formed."
[5] "On the other hand, the cluster with 14 Tatoms is large enough to account for all significant interactions between the cationic species and the zeolite framework as well as to describe activation of small molecules such as H2 and H2O."
[6] "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol−1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol−1)."
[7] "Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate."
[8] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. Higher Ga/Al ratios and lower Si/Al ratios favor the formation of binuclear gallium sites, while a higher framework aluminum pair density promotes the stabilization of hydroxyl-bridged gallium-containing cationic reaction intermediates, facilitating hydrogen desorption and enhancing propane dehydrogenation activity.
