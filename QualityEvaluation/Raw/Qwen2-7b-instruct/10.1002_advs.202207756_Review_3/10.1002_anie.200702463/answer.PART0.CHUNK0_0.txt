The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. Higher Si/Al ratios and a denser framework aluminum pair density tend to promote the formation of binuclear gallium species, such as the Ga2O2 core structure, which are more active in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The structure-activity correlations in these catalysts highlight the importance of the zeolite framework in stabilizing gallium species and facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和框架铝对密度影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。较高的Si/Al比例和更密集的框架铝对密度倾向于促进二核镓物种（如Ga2O2核心结构）的形成，这些物种在丙烷脱氢反应中更为活跃。这些催化剂的结构-活性相关性强调了沸石骨架在稳定镓物种和促进脱氢过程中的重要性。
