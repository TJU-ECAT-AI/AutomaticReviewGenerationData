The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. Higher Si/Al ratios and a denser framework aluminum pair density tend to promote the formation of binuclear gallium species, such as the Ga2O2 core structure, which are more active in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The structure-activity correlations in these catalysts highlight the importance of the zeolite framework in stabilizing gallium species and facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the structure and stability of the gallium clusters within the zeolite framework. The presence of framework aluminum pairs is crucial for stabilizing the gallium clusters, particularly the binuclear gallium species. These relationships reveal that a higher concentration of framework aluminum pairs facilitates the formation of more stable gallium clusters, leading to enhanced activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The gallium hydrides, such as GaO+, are stabilized by the zeolite framework, especially through the coordination of oxygen atoms from the framework to the gallium cations, forming a Ga2O2 core. This structure is energetically favorable for hydrogen recombination, which is essential for the catalytic cycle in propane dehydrogenation. The presence of water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, lowering the energy barrier for hydrogen recombination and facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The structure-activity correlations highlight the importance of the zeolite framework's architecture in determining the efficiency of propane conversion over Ga-modified zeolite catalysts.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例以及改性沸石催化剂中的框架铝对簇中镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有影响，从而影响丙烷脱氢反应的活性。框架铝对的存在对于稳定镓簇至关重要，尤其是二核镓物种。这些关系表明，框架铝对的浓度越高，形成的镓簇越稳定，从而在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性。镓氢化物，如GaO+，通过框架氧原子与镓离子的配位形成，形成一个Ga2O2核心，这有利于氢重组，这是催化循环的关键步骤。水的存在促进了活性部分水解的镓物种的形成，降低了氢重组的能量壁垒，促进了脱氢过程。结构-活性相关性强调了沸石骨架架构的重要性，在Ga改性沸石催化剂中确定了丙烷转化的效率。

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species. Higher Si/Al ratios and lower Ga/Al ratios tend to favor the formation of gallium hydrides, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The structure-activity correlation reveals that the presence of framework aluminum pairs, particularly when they are in close proximity, enhances the stability and reactivity of gallium species. This leads to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as evidenced by increased activity and selectivity towards propylene formation. The EXAFS analysis confirms the presence of gallium-oxygen clusters, indicating the role of gallium hydrides in the catalytic cycle.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. These relationships highlight the importance of the catalyst's structure in determining its activity for propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the enhanced activity observed with the addition of water to the feed suggests that water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The quantum-chemical cluster calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for hydrogen recombination decreases significantly when the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring gallium cation, facilitating the desorption of hydrogen. Furthermore, the EXAFS spectra provide structural information about the gallium species present in Ga/ZSM-5, indicating the presence of a Ga2O2 core structure coordinating to the zeolite oxygen anions. This core structure aligns with the DFT calculations, offering insights into the structure-activity correlations of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.
