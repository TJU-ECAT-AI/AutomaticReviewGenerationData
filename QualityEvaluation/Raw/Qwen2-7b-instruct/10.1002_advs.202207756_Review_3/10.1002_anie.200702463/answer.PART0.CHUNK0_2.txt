[1] "Recent experimental58 and computational913 studies have contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites."
[2] "As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered."
[3] "Quantum-chemical calculations13 showed that CH bond activation by reduced Ga/ZSM-5 proceeds over the Lewis acidbase pair formed by the Ga+ ion and a zeolite-framework basic oxygen anion (Ga+ZO)."
[4] "Earlier studies6,10 have shown that H2O formation [Eq.(4)] is energetically favored over H2 desorption [Eq.(3)] catalyzed by these mononuclear GaO+ species."
[5] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."
[6] "Table 3 lists the EXAFS fit parameters for a model catalyst obtained by oxidation of Ga+/ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide at 473K that shows a high initial activity in propane conversion."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species. Higher Si/Al ratios and lower Ga/Al ratios tend to favor the formation of gallium hydrides, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The structure-activity correlation reveals that the presence of framework aluminum pairs, particularly when they are in close proximity, enhances the stability and reactivity of gallium species. This leads to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as evidenced by increased activity and selectivity towards propylene formation. The EXAFS analysis confirms the presence of gallium-oxygen clusters, indicating the role of gallium hydrides in the catalytic cycle.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种的形成和性质。较高的Si/Al比和较低的Ga/Al比倾向于促进镓氢化物的形成，这对于烷烃脱氢至关重要。结构-活性相关性表明，当它们靠近时，框架铝对的存在可以增强镓物种的稳定性和反应性。这导致丙烷脱氢反应性能的改进，表现为活性和丙烯选择性的增加。EXAFS分析证实了镓氧簇的存在，这表明镓氢化物在催化循环中的作用。
