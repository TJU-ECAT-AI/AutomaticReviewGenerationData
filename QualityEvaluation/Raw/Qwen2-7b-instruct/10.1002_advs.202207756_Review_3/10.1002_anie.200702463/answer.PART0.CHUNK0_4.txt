The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. These relationships highlight the importance of the catalyst's structure in determining its activity for propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the enhanced activity observed with the addition of water to the feed suggests that water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The quantum-chemical cluster calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for hydrogen recombination decreases significantly when the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring gallium cation, facilitating the desorption of hydrogen. Furthermore, the EXAFS spectra provide structural information about the gallium species present in Ga/ZSM-5, indicating the presence of a Ga2O2 core structure coordinating to the zeolite oxygen anions. This core structure aligns with the DFT calculations, offering insights into the structure-activity correlations of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对在Ga修饰沸石催化剂中的作用显著影响活性镓物种，尤其是镓氢化物的形成和性质。这些关系强调了催化剂结构对于丙烷脱氢反应活性的重要性。特别是，水的添加导致的活性提升表明水促进了活性部分水解镓物种的形成。量子化学簇计算显示，当羟基团与相邻的镓原子配位时，氢重组的能量壁垒明显降低，从而促进氢的释放。此外，X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱提供了Ga/ZSM-5中镓物种的结构信息，表明存在一个与骨架氧阴离子协调的Ga2O2核心结构。这一核心结构与DFT计算结果一致，为Ga修饰沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的结构-活性相关性提供了见解。
