<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly impact the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. These factors determine how effectively the catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation and cracking processes. The specific relationships elucidate the structure-activity correlations within these catalysts, providing a deeper understanding of their operational efficiency in such reactions.
