The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. As the Ga/Al ratio increases, the formation of gallium hydrides becomes more pronounced, affecting the catalyst's activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Altering the Si/Al ratio impacts the catalyst's structure, potentially altering its selectivity towards desired products. The framework aluminum pair density, which is indicative of the catalyst's microstructure, also plays a crucial role in determining the type and stability of gallium species present. These relationships highlight the importance of precise control over the catalyst's composition for optimizing its performance in propane dehydrogenation and cracking processes.
