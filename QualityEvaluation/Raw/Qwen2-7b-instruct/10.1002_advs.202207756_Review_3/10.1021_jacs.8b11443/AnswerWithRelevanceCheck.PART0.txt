          [1] "Mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3."
          [2] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density have significant influence on the formation and nature of active gallium species."
          [3] "These relationships reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions."

      <English>
          The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These factors correlate with the structure-activity relationships in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

      <English>
          The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts affect the formation and nature of active gallium species, such as gallium hydrides, which in turn impacts the efficiency and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation and cracking reactions.
