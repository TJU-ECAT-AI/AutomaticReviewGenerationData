[1] "Mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3."
[2] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species."
[3] "These relationships shed light on the structure-activity correlations within the catalyst system for propane dehydrogenation reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts affect the formation and nature of active gallium species, such as gallium hydrides, which in turn impacts the efficiency and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation and cracking reactions.
