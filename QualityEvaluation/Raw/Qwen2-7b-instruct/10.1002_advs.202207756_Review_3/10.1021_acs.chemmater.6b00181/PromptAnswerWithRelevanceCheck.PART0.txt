<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, such as gallium hydrides, through their roles in determining the structure and activity of the catalyst. Specifically, the Ga/Al ratio significantly affects the formation of gallium hydrides, while the Si/Al ratio contributes to the structure and activity of the catalyst. Additionally, the framework aluminum pair density impacts the stability and reactivity of the gallium species. These relationships highlight the importance of achieving an optimal balance among these parameters to maximize the formation of active gallium species in the context of propane dehydrogenation reactions.
