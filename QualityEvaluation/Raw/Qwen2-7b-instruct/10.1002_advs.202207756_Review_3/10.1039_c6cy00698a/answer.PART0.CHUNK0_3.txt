[1] "The reported appearance of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has led some authors to conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for al- kane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mecha- nism."

[3] "The synthesis and XANES characterization of a series of molecular and surface-bound organometallic model compounds designed to provide insight into (non-re- dox) ligand effects on gallium K edge XANES spectra."
[4] "The results in Fig. 3a suggest that the equilibrium between species C and D is shifted strongly toward D at high temperatures, at lower temperatures species C is expected to predominate."

1. Some authors argue that Ga+ is crucial for the catalytic cycle in alkane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation occurring through oxidative addition/reductive elimination processes. 
2. Gallium+ compounds are mainly found in artificially created organometallic complexes meant for studying gallium in exceptional oxidation states.
3. Researchers synthesized and characterized a series of molecular and surface-bound organometallic model compounds to investigate the effects of ligands on gallium K edge XANES spectra without redox reactions.
4. At higher temperatures, species D predominates over species C, but at lower temperatures, species C is anticipated to be more prevalent.
5. The spectrum of GaR3 grafted to zeolite H-BEA matches closely with that of [GaCH2SiMe3)2(OSiPh3)]2 as shown in Figure S7.

1. 一些作者认为，Ga+是烷烃脱氢反应催化循环中必不可少的物种，烷烃活化通过氧化插入/还原消除机制进行。
2. Ga+化合物主要存在于专门设计用于研究在非典型氧化状态下的镓的有机金属复合物中。
3. 研究人员合成了并表征了一系列分子和表面附着的有机金属模型化合物，以无还原性作用的方式提供对镓K边缘XANES光谱中配体效应的见解。
4. 在较高温度下，D物种占主导地位，而在较低温度下，预计C物种会更占优势。
5. GaR3附着到H-BEA沸石上的光谱与GaCH2SiMe3)2(OSiPh3)]2的光谱相匹配，如图S7所示。
