[1] "The reported appearance of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has led some authors to conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for al- kane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mecha- nism."
[2] "However, a change in oxidation state is not the only factor that can give rise to a change in the XANES spectrum."
[3] "We demonstrate that changes in the identity and number of gallium nearest neighbors can give rise to changes in XANES spectra similar to those attributed in literature to changes in oxidation state."
[4] "In order to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts, we have synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic Ga species and compared their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions."
[5] "The study of alkane dehydrogenation on supports such as silica that lack strong Brnsted acid sites provides a useful complement to study of Ga-zeolite catalysts by enabling the dehydrogenation reaction to be investigated directly without interference from subsequent proton-catalyzed oligomeriza- tion and aromatization reactions."
[6] "We believe it is likely that Ga3+ does not undergo reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehy- drogenation, and that CH bond activation on Ga3+ catalysts instead proceeds via non-redox, heterolytic cleavage or sigma- bond metathesis mechanisms involving Ga3+ alkyl and hy- dride intermediates."

2. A change in oxidation state isn't the only factor that can cause a change in the XANES spectrum.
3. We show that changes in the identity and number of gallium nearest neighbors can lead to XANES spectra similar to those attributed to changes in oxidation state.
4. We synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic gallium species to compare their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions, aiming to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts.
5. Studying alkane dehydrogenation on silica supports without strong Brnsted acid sites complements the study of Ga-zeolite catalysts by allowing direct investigation of the dehydrogenation reaction without interference from subsequent proton-catalyzed oligomerization and aromatization reactions.
6. Based on the findings, it is likely that Ga3+ does not undergo reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehydrogenation, and CH bond activation on Ga3+ catalysts proceeds via non-redox, heterolytic cleavage or sigma-bond metathesis mechanisms involving Ga3+ alkyl and hydride intermediates.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. In the study, the acid form of zeolite beta with a Si : Al ratio of 25 was selected, and impregnated with gallium nitrate to create a catalyst containing 3.4 wt% Ga. The XANES spectra of this catalyst, collected while heating in hydrogen from room temperature to 500°C, show changes that are indicative of the nature of the gallium species involved in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
