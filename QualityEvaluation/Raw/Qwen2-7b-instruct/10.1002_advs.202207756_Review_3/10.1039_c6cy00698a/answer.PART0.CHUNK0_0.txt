[1] "The reported appearance of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has led some authors to conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for al- kane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mecha- nism."
[2] "However, a change in oxidation state is not the only factor that can give rise to a change in the XANES spectrum."
[3] "We demonstrate that changes in the identity and number of gallium nearest neighbors can give rise to changes in XANES spectra similar to those attributed in literature to changes in oxidation state."
[4] "In order to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts, we have synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic Ga species and compared their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions."
[5] "The study of alkane dehydrogenation on supports such as silica that lack strong Brnsted acid sites provides a useful complement to study of Ga-zeolite catalysts by enabling the dehydrogenation reaction to be investigated directly without interference from subsequent proton-catalyzed oligomeriza- tion and aromatization reactions."
[6] "We believe it is likely that Ga3+ does not undergo reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehy- drogenation, and that CH bond activation on Ga3+ catalysts instead proceeds via non-redox, heterolytic cleavage or sigma- bond metathesis mechanisms involving Ga3+ alkyl and hy- dride intermediates."

1. Some authors conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for alkane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mechanism, based on the appearance of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts.
2. A change in oxidation state isn't the only factor that can cause a change in the XANES spectrum.
3. We show that changes in the identity and number of gallium nearest neighbors can lead to XANES spectra similar to those attributed to changes in oxidation state.
4. We synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic gallium species to compare their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions, aiming to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts.
5. Studying alkane dehydrogenation on silica supports without strong Brnsted acid sites complements the study of Ga-zeolite catalysts by allowing direct investigation of the dehydrogenation reaction without interference from subsequent proton-catalyzed oligomerization and aromatization reactions.
6. Based on the findings, it is likely that Ga3+ does not undergo reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehydrogenation, and CH bond activation on Ga3+ catalysts proceeds via non-redox, heterolytic cleavage or sigma-bond metathesis mechanisms involving Ga3+ alkyl and hydride intermediates.

1. 一些作者基于在Ga-沸石催化剂中还原条件下出现Ga+的现象，得出结论：Ga+是烷烃脱氢反应催化循环中的关键物种，烷烃激活通过氧化加成/还原消除机制进行。
2. 改变氧化状态不是引起XANES谱变化的唯一因素。
3. 我们表明，改变镓原子周围邻居的身份和数量可以导致与氧化状态改变相关的XANES谱变化。
4. 我们合成了系列分子模型化合物并嫁接表面有机金属镓物种，与在还原条件下获得的镓基催化剂的XANES谱进行了比较，旨在更好地理解工作催化剂的XANES谱。
5. 对于缺乏强Brnsted酸位点的硅基支持物上进行的烷烃脱氢研究，为直接研究脱氢反应提供了补充，而无需干扰随后的质子催化缩合和芳构化反应。
6. 根据发现，很可能是Ga3+在烷烃脱氢过程中不会还原到Ga+，而是在Ga3+烷基和氢中间体参与下，通过非氧化还原、异裂或σ键互换机制进行CH键活化。
