[1] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides."
[2] "For the most heavily studied catalyst, Ga-ZSM-5, a variety of active site structures have been proposed. These include Ga3+ species associated with zeolite [AlO4] anions such as isolated gallyl cations [GaO]+, gallium hydrides [GaH2]+ or [GaH]2+, or a reduced Ga+ species stabilized by the negative charge of the zeolite framework."
[3] "Alternately, alkane dehydrogenation has been proposed to take place on gallium oxide particles outside of the zeolite pores."
[4] "Given the long-standing interest in understanding and exploiting mechanisms for selective functionalization of alkanes, it is of significance to establish whether the mechanism of CH bond activation is redox or non-redox in nature."
[5] "In order to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts, we have synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic Ga species and compared their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions."
[6] "We report here the synthesis and XANES characterization of a series of molecular and surface-bound organometallic model compounds designed to provide insight into (non-redox) ligand effects on gallium K edge XANES spectra."
[7] "The results in Fig. 6 and Table 1 clearly illustrate that significant changes in XANES edge energy can arise entirely due to changes in the coordination environment around gallium, without a change in formal oxidation state."
[8] "No molecular reference compound examined in the present study provides as close a match for the XANES spectrum of GaH-BEA in hydrogen at 500 C as the spectra of (6) and (4-1) provide for GaSiO2 in hydrogen at 650 C."

1. 镓/铝比例、硅/铝比例和骨架铝对的比例在镓改性沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物。
2. 镓改性沸石催化剂中的活性镓物种可能包括与沸石[AlO4]离子相关的Ga3+，如孤立的甘油离子[GaO]+，镓氢化物[GaH2]+或[GaH]2+，或者由沸石框架负电荷稳定的一种减少的Ga+物种。
3. 烷烃脱氢也可能发生在沸石孔外的镓氧化物颗粒上。
4. 确定CH键活化机制是还原还是非还原对于理解并利用烷烃选择性功能化至关重要。
5. 对分子模型化合物的合成和XANES表征进行了研究，以了解镓K边缘XANES光谱中的配体效应。
6. 合成了分子模型化合物以提供关于镓K边缘XANES光谱中配体效应的信息。
7. 单纯由于镓周围的配位环境变化即可引起XANES边沿能量的显著变化，而无需改变其形式的氧化状态。
8. 在氢气中加热至500°C时，GaH-BEA的XANES光谱最好与在650°C下氢气中加热的GaSiO2的光谱相匹配，这两者分别由(6)和(4-1)提供。
