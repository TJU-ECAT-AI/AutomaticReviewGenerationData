www.rsc.org/catalysis Organometallic model complexes elucidate the active gallium species in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts based on ligand effects in Ga K-edge XANES"

"The conventional gallium-based alkane aromatization catalyst is prepared by impregnation of an acidic zeolite with an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate, followed by calcination in air. In the present study, the acid form of zeolite beta (Si : Al 25) was chosen, and impregnated with gallium nitrate to produce a catalyst containing 3.4 wt% Ga (confirmed by elemental analysis)."

"In order to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts, we have synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic Ga species and compared their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions."

"The reported appearance of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has led some authors to conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for alkane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mechanism."

"In the present study, the acid form of zeolite beta (Si : Al 25) was chosen, and impregnated with gallium nitrate to produce a catalyst containing 3.4 wt% Ga (confirmed by elemental analysis). XANES spectra of this catalyst were then collected while heating in hydrogen from RT to 500 C. The results are shown in Fig. 1a. The corresponding ΔXANES, generated by subtraction of the room temperature spectrum, are shown in Fig. 1b."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. In the study, the acid form of zeolite beta with a Si : Al ratio of 25 was selected, and impregnated with gallium nitrate to create a catalyst containing 3.4 wt% Ga. The XANES spectra of this catalyst, collected while heating in hydrogen from room temperature to 500°C, show changes that are indicative of the nature of the gallium species involved in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between catalyst structure and activity in propane dehydrogenation processes.

在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。研究中选择了Si：Al比为25的酸性沸石β的形式，并通过浸渍氯化镓溶液并进行空气煅烧制备了含3.4 wt% Ga的催化剂。收集了该催化剂在氢气氛围下从室温加热至500°C的XANES光谱，结果表明这些变化反映了参与烷烃脱氢反应的镓物种的性质。这些结果有助于理解丙烷脱氢过程中的催化剂结构与活性之间的关系。
