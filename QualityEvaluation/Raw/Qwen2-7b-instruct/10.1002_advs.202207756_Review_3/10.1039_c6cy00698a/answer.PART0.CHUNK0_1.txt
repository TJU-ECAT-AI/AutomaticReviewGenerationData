Gallium-modified zeolites are known catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, reactivity that finds industrial application in the aromatization of light alkanes by Ga-ZSM5. While the role of gallium cations in alkane activation is well known, the oxidation state and coordination environment of gallium under reaction conditions has been the subject of debate.

Gallium-modified zeolites are recognized as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, a process utilized industrially for the aromatization of light alkanes through Ga-ZSM5. The function of gallium ions in alkane activation is understood, yet the oxidation state and coordination environment of gallium under reaction conditions are subjects of discussion.

Edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have long been interpreted as evidence for reduction of GaIII) to GaI). However, a change in oxidation state is not the only factor that can give rise to a change in the XANES spectrum.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Under reaction conditions, shifts in the Ga K-edge XANES spectra have traditionally been seen as proof of gallium reduction from GaIII to GaI. Yet, a change in oxidation state is not the sole cause for alterations in the XANES spectrum.
