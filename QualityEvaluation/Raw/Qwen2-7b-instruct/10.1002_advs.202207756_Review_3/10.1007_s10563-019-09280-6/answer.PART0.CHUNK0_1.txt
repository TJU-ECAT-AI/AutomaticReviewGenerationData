The reaction conditions, such as temperature, residence time, steam to oil ratio, catalyst to oil ratio, and partial pressure, significantly influence the yield of light olefins in steam catalytic cracking. The temperature requirements depend on the type of catalyst, feedstock, and the expected product slate. Steam substitution for nitrogen increases light olefin yield. Metal oxide catalysts typically require higher temperatures, whereas molecular sieve catalysts operate at lower temperatures. The reaction mechanism in steam catalytic cracking varies with catalyst and technology. Steam enhances the product distribution, and the product yields are consistent with changes in operating conditions. Molecular sieve-based catalysts in steam catalytic cracking operate at lower temperatures, offering energy savings compared to conventional steam cracking.

反应条件，如温度、停留时间、蒸汽与油的比例、催化剂与油的比例和部分压力，显著影响蒸汽催化裂解中轻烯烃的产率。温度要求取决于催化剂类型、原料和预期产物系列。将氮气替换为蒸汽可以增加轻烯烃的产率。金属氧化物催化剂通常需要更高的温度，而分子筛催化剂在较低温度下运行。蒸汽催化裂解的反应机制随催化剂和技术而变化。蒸汽不仅充当稀释剂和流化气体的功能，还能影响产品分布。随着操作条件的变化，产品的产率保持一致。基于分子筛的催化剂在蒸汽催化裂解中运行于较低温度，相比传统蒸汽裂解提供节能效果。
