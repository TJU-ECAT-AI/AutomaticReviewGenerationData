The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product.
The very nature of the FCC unit means that it will also struggle to process light feeds such as naphtha, which require relatively high cracking temperatures than heavy feeds.
Also the use of light feeds need to be accompanied by suitable active and selective catalysts to ensure the production of light olefins.
The nature of the pores in an FCC catalyst particle gives rise to a hierarchical pore architecture spanning from the macro- to meso- to microporosity.

1. The use of ethane-based feeds in steam crackers has shifted towards maximizing ethylene production, resulting in reduced propylene yield.
2. Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) units face difficulties processing light feeds like naphtha due to their higher required cracking temperatures compared to heavier feeds.
3. To produce light olefins from light feeds, suitable active and selective catalysts are essential.
4. The structure of FCC catalyst particles includes a hierarchical pore architecture ranging from macro to meso to micropores.
