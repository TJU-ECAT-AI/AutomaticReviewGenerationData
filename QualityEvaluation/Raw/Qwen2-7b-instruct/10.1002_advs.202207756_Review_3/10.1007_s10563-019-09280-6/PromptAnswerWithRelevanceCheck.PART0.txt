The reaction conditions, such as temperature, residence time, steam to oil ratio, catalyst to oil ratio, and partial pressure, significantly influence the yield of light olefins in steam catalytic cracking. The temperature requirements depend on the type of catalyst, feedstock, and the expected product slate. Steam substitution for nitrogen increases light olefin yield. Metal oxide catalysts typically require higher temperatures, whereas molecular sieve catalysts operate at lower temperatures. The reaction mechanism in steam catalytic cracking varies with catalyst and technology. Steam enhances the product distribution, and the product yields are consistent with changes in operating conditions. Molecular sieve-based catalysts in steam catalytic cracking operate at lower temperatures, offering energy savings compared to conventional steam cracking.

The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product.
The very nature of the FCC unit means that it will also struggle to process light feeds such as naphtha, which require relatively high cracking temperatures than heavy feeds.
Also the use of light feeds need to be accompanied by suitable active and selective catalysts to ensure the production of light olefins.
The nature of the pores in an FCC catalyst particle gives rise to a hierarchical pore architecture spanning from the macro- to meso- to microporosity.

The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC),while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydroge- nation contributed 19%.

Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The type of feedstock used in steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce less propylene, as illustrated in Table1 [2].

A major alternative to the steam cracker as a source of propylene is the FCC where the use of catalysts leads to much lower operating temperatures than those in steam crackers [4]. By employing a catalyst, it is also possible to tilt the selectivity in favor of propylene instead of ethylene.

The FCC was originally designed to upgrade low value feeds such as vacuum gas oil (VGO) and atmospheric residue to gasoline, and as such, a suitable catalyst is required if light olefins are to form a major part of the product slate. The very nature of the FCC unit means that it will also struggle to process light feeds such as naphtha, which require relatively high cracking temperatures than heavy feeds. Also the use of light feeds need to be accompanied by suitable active and selective catalysts to ensure the production of light olefins.

Other challenges associated with the use of light feed such as naphtha are lower coke yield, lower regenerator temperature and elevated catalyst circulation rates to account for higher endothermic heat of reaction since catalyst is the main heat carrier in the FCC. Therefore, more active catalysts are required to generate sufficient coke yields to close the FCC energy balance in support of stable operations. It is, therefore important to develop a technology that is capable of processing light feed like naphtha with the aim of maximizing light olefin production.

Therefore, a new route to convert light feeds such as naphtha into value added light olefins is required, and steam catalytic cracking is an alternative technology that combines useful aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to increase the yield of both ethylene and propylene at relatively lower temperatures than in steam cracking [3, 5]. The use of temperatures higher than those in FCC, but lower than those in steam crackers, in combination with a suitable cata- lyst can help ensure that light olefins are the main products as illustrated in Table2. The amount of steam used in steam catalytic cracking will hydrothermally deactivate conven- tional FCC catalysts, therefore, special catalyst capable of withstanding high temperatures and high amount of steam need to be developed for commercial applications.

The literature discusses how the shift to lighter, ethane-based feeds has reduced propylene production from steam crackers, leading to a need for alternative technologies to produce more propylene. It highlights that fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) offers lower operating temperatures compared to steam crackers and can be tuned to favor propylene production over ethylene. However, the FCC struggles with processing light feeds like naphtha, requiring specific catalysts for light olefin production. Steam catalytic cracking combines elements of catalytic and steam cracking to produce ethylene and propylene at lower temperatures than steam cracking, offering a potential solution for maximizing light olefin production from light feeds. Special catalysts capable of withstanding high temperatures and steam are needed for commercial applications in steam catalytic cracking.

文献指出，由于轻质乙烷基原料的使用导致蒸汽裂解装置的丙烯产量降低，因此需要开发替代技术来增加丙烯产量。文献强调，催化裂化（FCC）可以提供比蒸汽裂解更低的操作温度，并可以通过催化剂调整来优化丙烯的生产。然而，FCC在处理如石脑油这类轻质原料时存在困难，需要特定催化剂以促进轻烯烃的生产。蒸汽催化裂解结合了催化裂解和蒸汽裂解的优点，在比蒸汽裂解更低的温度下生产乙烯和丙烯，为从轻质原料中最大化生产轻烯烃提供了可能解决方案。对于商业应用而言，需要开发能够承受高温和高蒸汽量的特殊催化剂。
