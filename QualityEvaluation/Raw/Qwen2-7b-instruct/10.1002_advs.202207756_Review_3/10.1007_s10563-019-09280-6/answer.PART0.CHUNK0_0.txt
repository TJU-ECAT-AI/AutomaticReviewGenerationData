1. Traditional methods accounted for 81% of propylene production, with 50% coming from steam cracking and 31% from Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC).

2. The extent to which steam catalytic cracking affects light olefin yield is dependent on several operational parameters, including reaction temperature, residence time, steam-to-oil weight ratio, catalyst-to-oil weight ratio, and partial pressure.

3. The use of steam in steam catalytic cracking can lead to the hydrothermal deactivation of conventional FCC catalysts, necessitating the development of special catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and high steam content for commercial use.

4. In steam catalytic cracking, the residence time or space time is crucial and varies based on reactor design.

5. The feedstock's aromaticity can be evaluated using the BMCI (Boiling Point Median Index), a correlation index created by the U.S. Bureau of Mines.

6. The product distribution in steam catalytic cracking is significantly influenced by the mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

1. 传统的工艺占到了81%的丙烯产量，其中蒸汽裂解贡献了50%，流化催化裂解（FCC）贡献了31%。

2. 蒸汽催化裂解对轻烯烃产率的影响程度依赖于反应温度、停留时间、蒸汽与油质量比、催化剂与油质量比以及部分压力等操作参数。

3. 在蒸汽催化裂解中，蒸汽的使用可能会导致传统FCC催化剂的热水性失活，因此需要开发能够承受高温和高蒸汽量的特殊催化剂以供商业应用。

4. 对于蒸汽催化裂解而言，停留时间和空间时间是一个重要参数，其取决于反应器配置。

5. 邻苯二甲酸酐指数（BMCI，由美国矿业局制定），可以用来评估进料的芳烃含量。

6. 蒸汽催化裂解的产物分布主要受到反应机制路径的影响。
