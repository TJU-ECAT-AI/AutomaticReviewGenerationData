[1] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts were varied to study their impact on the formation and nature of active gallium species."
[2] "A highly reactive site in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation was attributed to Ga2O22+ stabilized by paired framework Al atoms in MFI."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. This relationship reveals the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, Ga2O22+ stabilized by paired framework Al atoms in MFI forms a highly reactive site in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率以及改性沸石催化剂中框架铝对的密度，影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。这种关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性。具体而言，在MFI中由配对框架Al原子稳定化的Ga2O22+形成了非氧化性丙烷脱氢反应中的一个高度活性位点。
