[1] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts were systematically varied."
[2] "The formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, were closely related to the aforementioned parameters."
[3] "These relationships revealed significant structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. These parameters are crucial in establishing structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
