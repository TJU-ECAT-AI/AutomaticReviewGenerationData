[1] "The influence of the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on the formation and nature of active gallium species, such as gallium hydrides, was extensively explored."
[2] "These parameters were found to have significant effects on the structure-activity correlations of the catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly impact the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides, within Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. These factors play a crucial role in determining the structure-activity correlations of the catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process.
