[1] "Starting from the molecular side, we used accurate ab initio calculations to study the reaction between methane and a molecular zeolite cluster."
[2] "Perturbation of these clusters could be used to assess the effects of the heterogeneity of proton affinity (acidity) between different sites in a zeolite."
[3] "Combining both, we were able to predict both the reaction rate itself as well as the difference in reaction rates between these two zeolites."
[4] "It was found that the reaction rate is determined by differences in acidity between the two oxygen sites involved in the exchange process, and the absolute acidity does not play a role."
[5] "Finally, the theoretical results compare favorably with experimental data, showing that with present day computational capabilities it is possible to shed light on zeolite-catalyzed reactions."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are closely tied to the specific ratios and densities mentioned. The ab initio calculations allowed for the prediction of reaction rates and differences between zeolites, demonstrating that the reaction rate is determined by the differences in acidity between oxygen sites, rather than their absolute acidity. The theoretical predictions matched experimental findings, validating the use of computational methods in understanding zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和骨架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。这些关系表明，丙烷脱氢反应的结构-活性相关性紧密依赖于所提到的具体比例和密度。从第一原理计算允许预测反应速率和两种沸石之间的差异，表明反应速率是由参与交换过程的氧位点间的酸度差异决定的，而不是它们的绝对酸度。理论预测与实验结果相匹配，验证了使用计算方法理解沸石催化反应的有效性。
