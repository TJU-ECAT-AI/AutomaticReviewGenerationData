[1] "The problem was approached from two different perspectives. Starting from the molecular side, we used accurate ab initio calculations to study the reaction between"
[2] "We then estimated these proton affinity differences for FAU and MFI by means of force field calculations on periodic lattices."
[3] "Combining both, we were able to predict both the reaction rate itself as well as the difference in reaction rates between these two zeolites."
[4] "It was found that the reaction rate is determined by differences in acidity between the two oxygen sites involved in the exchange process, and the absolute acidity does not play a role."

The reaction rate in the D/H exchange between deuterated methane and zeolites FAU and MFI is determined by the differences in acidity between the two oxygen sites involved, not by their absolute acidity. The reaction rate can be predicted using ab initio calculations and force field estimations of proton affinity differences.

在FAU和MFI这两种沸石中，二甲基与氢交换反应速率由参与交换过程的两个氧原子位点之间的酸性差异决定，而不是绝对酸性。通过使用分子层面的原初计算和周期结构上的力场估计来预测质子亲和力差异，可以预测出这两种沸石中的反应速率。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
