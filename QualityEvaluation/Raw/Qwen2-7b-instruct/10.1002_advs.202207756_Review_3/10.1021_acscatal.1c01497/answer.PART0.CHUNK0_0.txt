The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts affect the formation and nature of active gallium species, such as gallium hydrides. This relationship reveals how these structural parameters correlate with the catalyst's activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
