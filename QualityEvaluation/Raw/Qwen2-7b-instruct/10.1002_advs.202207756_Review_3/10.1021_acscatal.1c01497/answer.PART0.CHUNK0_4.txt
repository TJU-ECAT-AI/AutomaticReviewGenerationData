[1] "The correlation between Ga speciation and propane dehydrogenation activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts has been extensively studied."
[2] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species."
[3] "In particular, the presence of gallium hydrides is closely related to the aforementioned parameters."
[4] "Understanding these relationships is crucial for optimizing the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions."
