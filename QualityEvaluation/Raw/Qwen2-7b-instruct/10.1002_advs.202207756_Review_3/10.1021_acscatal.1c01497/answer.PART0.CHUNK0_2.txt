[1] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts were systematically varied to study their influence on the formation and nature of active gallium species."
[2] "It was found that increasing the Ga/Al ratio led to a higher concentration of gallium hydrides."
[3] "The Si/Al ratio had a minor effect on the formation of gallium species, but high values of Si/Al ratio could decrease the activity due to the formation of less stable gallium sites."
[4] "Framework aluminum pair density was crucial in determining the stability of gallium species; higher densities led to more stable gallium sites."
[5] "These relationships revealed strong structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions, indicating that precise control over the composition of Ga/Al, Si/Al, and aluminum pair density in zeolites can significantly enhance catalytic performance."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. Increasing the Ga/Al ratio results in a higher concentration of gallium hydrides, whereas the Si/Al ratio has a minor impact but can decrease activity if too high, leading to less stable gallium sites. Framework aluminum pair density plays a critical role in stabilizing gallium species, with higher densities promoting more stable gallium sites. These relationships demonstrate strong structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions, suggesting that controlling the composition of these elements in zeolites can significantly improve catalytic efficiency.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和骨架铝配对密度在改性沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种（尤其是镓氢化物）的形成和性质。增加Ga/Al比导致镓氢化物浓度更高，而Si/Al比的影响较小，但过高的值可能会降低活性，因为会导致不稳定镓位点的形成。骨架铝配对密度对于稳定镓物种至关重要，较高的密度促进了更稳定的镓位点。这些关系表明丙烷脱氢反应中的强结构-活性相关性，暗示通过精确控制沸石中Ga/Al、Si/Al和铝配对密度的组成可以显著提高催化性能。
