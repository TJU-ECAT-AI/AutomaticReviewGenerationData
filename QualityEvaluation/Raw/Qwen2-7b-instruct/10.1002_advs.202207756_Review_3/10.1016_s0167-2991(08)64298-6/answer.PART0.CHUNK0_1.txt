[1] "Ga ions act as 'portholes' [16] for desorption of H-adatoms and facilitate the reverse process - the introduction of D-atoms in the products of propane/D mixtures."
[2] "The deuterium content in the products increases when Ga or Zn are introduced into H-ZSM5 (Figure 2)."
[3] "Hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps become increasingly reversible (less exergic) and the surface hydrogen pool contains a much greater contribution from the (D2) gas phase."
[4] "In-situ EXAFS measurements show that Ga³⁺ ions exchanged into H-ZSM! are reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and during propane reactions (Figure 3)."
[5] "The reduction of Ga³⁺ species during hydrogen pretreatment and propane reactions (Figure 3) coincides with an increase in propane conversion rate and aromatic selectivity and with the appearance of H₂ among products."
[6] "Clearly, reduced Ga species allow conversion to occur with H-removal by recombinative desorption."
[7] "Propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H₂ selectivity increase as the density of reduced Ga atoms increases (Table)."
[8] "The surface fugacity that builds up during propane aromatization and leads to cracking by hydrogen transfer to carbocations is partially relieved by these reduced Ga sites."
[9] "Ga and Zn also decrease the residence time of reactive intermediates by providing a more effective pathway for acid site turnover."
[10] "Hydrogen desorption rates depend on the density of reduced Ga sites, measured by XAS studies during reaction."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal that higher densities of reduced gallium species, as indicated by XAS studies during reactions, correlate with increased propane conversion rates and aromatic selectivity. The presence of reduced gallium species facilitates conversion with hydrogen removal by recombinative desorption, thereby lowering hydrogen surface fugacities during propane conversion to aromatics. This mechanism allows acid sites to turnover without concurrent cracking, enhancing the overall catalytic performance of the zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。这些关系表明，反应期间通过XAS研究测量的减少镓物种的密度与丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性增加相关。减少的镓物种的存在使催化过程在丙烷转化为芳烃时发生，并通过重组脱附消除氢原子，从而降低表面氢逃逸。这一机制允许酸中心在不伴随裂解的情况下进行循环，从而增强沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的整体催化性能。
