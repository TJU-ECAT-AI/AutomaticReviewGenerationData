The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in ways that correlate with the catalyst's structure and activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of gallium ions modifies the surface properties of the zeolite, facilitating the formation of gallium hydrides. These gallium hydrides act as catalysts for the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms and lower hydrogen surface fugacities during the conversion of propane to aromatics. This results in an increase in propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity when gallium is introduced into non-framework positions in the zeolite. Gallium also decreases the residence time of reactive intermediates by providing an efficient pathway for acid site turnover. The density of reduced gallium atoms affects hydrogen desorption rates, indicating a strong relationship between catalyst structure and activity in terms of hydrogen management during the reaction process.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和骨架铝对对Ga改性的沸石催化剂的结构产生影响，进而影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。这些镓离子改变了沸石的表面性质，促进了镓氢化物的形成。这些镓氢化物能够促进氢原子的重组脱附，并降低氢表面势能，从而在丙烷转化为芳香烃的过程中提高了反应速率和选择性。当镓被引入沸石中的非骨架位置时，这种结构变化导致丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性增加。镓还通过提供一个高效的酸位周转途径，减少了反应中间体的停留时间。减小的镓原子密度影响了氢脱附速率，表明催化剂结构与氢管理过程中的活性之间存在着密切的关系。
