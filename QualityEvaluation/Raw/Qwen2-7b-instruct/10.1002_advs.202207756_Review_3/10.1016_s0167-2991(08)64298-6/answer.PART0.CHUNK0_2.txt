1. The density of reduced gallium atoms significantly influences the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. This relationship reveals that higher densities of reduced gallium atoms lead to increased formation of gallium hydrides and improved structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Gallium ions function as "portholes" for the desorption of hydrogen atoms (H-adatoms) on the catalyst surface.

3. During hydrogen pretreatment and propane reactions, the reduction of gallium trivalent ions (Ga³⁺) corresponds with an increase in propane conversion rate and aromatic selectivity, alongside the emergence of hydrogen molecules (H₂) among the products.

4. Reduced gallium species enable the occurrence of propane conversion processes accompanied by hydrogen removal through recombinative desorption.

5. An increase in the density of reduced gallium atoms enhances the propane aromatization rate, aromatic selectivity, deuterium content in the products, and hydrogen selectivity, thereby strengthening the structure-activity correlations in the zeolite catalyst system.

1. 减少的镓原子密度显著影响活性镓物种（特别是镓氢化物）在镓修饰沸石催化剂中的形成和性质。这种关系表明，更高的减少镓原子密度导致了镓氢化物的增加，并且在丙烷脱氢反应中提高了结构-活性相关性。

2. 镓离子作为“港口”用于脱附催化剂表面的氢原子（H-adatoms）。

3. 在氢预处理和丙烷反应期间，镓三价离子（Ga³⁺）的还原与丙烷转化率的增加、芳香选择性的提高以及产品中出现氢分子（H₂）相对应。

4. 减少的镓物种使丙烷转换过程伴随着重组脱附进行氢移除成为可能。

5. 增加的减少镓原子密度增强了丙烷芳构化速率、芳香选择性、产物中的氘含量和氢选择性，从而加强了在沸石催化剂系统中的结构-活性相关性。
