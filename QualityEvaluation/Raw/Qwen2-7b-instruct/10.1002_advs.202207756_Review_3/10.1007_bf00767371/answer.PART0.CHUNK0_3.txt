"Recent studies suggest that electrophilic activation of light alkanes occurs on superacid catalysts [1] and on Hg-based organometallic complexes [2] at low temperatures, and on weaker solid acids at higher temperatures [3-9], apparently via heterolytic cleavage of C-H bonds or intermediate partial oxidation of methane to methanol."

"Ga species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (fig. 5)."

"The presence of Ga species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (fig. 5)."

"Clearly, these pathways will require the presence of binding sites for such molecular hydrogen sinks."

"The observed low activity and carbon deposits, the low level of t3C enrichment in hydrocarbons (< 1.5% 13C) and CO2 products, and the promoting effect of CO on aromatics selectivity suggest that oxygen, as atoms or within undissociated CO, scavenges H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, leaving behind carbonaceous deposits..."

"Clearly, the stability of C1 carboxylic groups precludes their presence at high surface concentrations on thermodynamic grounds. Their stability may increase or their involvement may become unnecessary when alkyl or hydride acceptor species such as Ga+ provide thermodynamic sinks for the hydrogen or carbon fragments of the C-H bond activation step."

1. Recent studies indicate that superacid catalysts and Hg-based organometallic complexes activate light alkanes through heterolytic cleavage of C-H bonds or intermediate partial oxidation of methane to methanol at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, weaker solid acids also facilitate this activation via similar mechanisms.

2. Gallium species within zeolite channels significantly enhance the propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity.

3. Molecular hydrogen sinks are essential for hydrogen scavenging in dehydrogenation steps.

4. Oxygen, either as atoms or within undissociated CO, scavenges hydrogen atoms generated in dehydrogenation processes, leading to carbon deposition.

5. The stability of C1 carboxylic groups on thermodynamic grounds restricts their presence at high surface concentrations. However, when alkyl or hydride acceptor species like Ga+ are present, their stability might increase or their role might become dispensable.

1. 近期的研究表明，超级酸催化剂和基于Hg的有机金属复合物在低温下通过异裂性切断C-H键或甲烷部分氧化为甲醇来激活轻烷烃。在较高温度下，较弱的固体酸也通过类似机制促进这一激活过程。

2. 在沸石晶体通道中的镓物种显著提高了丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性。

3. 分子氢陷阱对于脱氢步骤中的氢原子收集至关重要。

4. 氧，无论是以原子形式还是未解离的CO形式，通过收集脱氢过程中生成的氢原子并留下碳沉积物，从而实现氢原子的收集。

5. 根据热力学原理，C1羧基团的存在受到限制。然而，当如Ga+这样的烷基或氢化物接受体物种存在时，其稳定性可能增加，或者它们的作用可能变得不必要。
