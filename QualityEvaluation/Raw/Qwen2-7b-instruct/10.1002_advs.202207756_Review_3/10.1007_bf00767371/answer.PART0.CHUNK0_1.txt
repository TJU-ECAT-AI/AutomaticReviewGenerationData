"Alkane conversion to aromatics occurs much more slowly because it is limited by rate of disposal of H-atoms formed in C-H scission steps and not by C-H bond activation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Conversion of alkanes to aromatics happens much more slowly due to the limitation by the rate of disposing of H-atoms formed in C-H bond breaking steps, rather than the activation of C-H bonds.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
烷烃转化为芳烃的速度要慢得多，因为这是由形成于C-H键断裂步骤中的H原子的处理速率所限制的，而不是C-H键的激活。

"The presence of Ga species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (fig. 5)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of gallium species within the zeolite channels significantly increases the propane conversion rates and the selectivity towards aromatics (Figure 5).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在沸石通道内存在镓物种导致丙烷转化率显著提高以及更高的芳烃选择性（图5）。

"If hydrogen disposal by recombinative desorption or hydrogen transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbons limits propane conversion rates and especially the selectivit y to aromatic products, stoichiometric scavengers of such H-adatoms should enhance aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
If hydrogen disposal through recombinative desorption or hydrogen transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbons limits propane conversion rates, particularly the selectivity towards aromatic products, stoichiometric scavengers of such hydrogen atoms should enhance the aromatic selectivity on H-ZSM5.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
如果氢的丢弃通过重组脱附或氢转移到吸附的烃类分子限制了丙烷的转化率，尤其是芳烃产物的选择性，那么对H-ZSM5的这样的氢原子的定量捕获剂应该增强芳烃的选择性。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
"The observed low activity and carbon deposits, the low level of t3C enrichment in hydrocarbons (< 1.5% 13C) and CO2 products, and the promoting effect of CO on aromatics selectivity suggest that oxygen, as atoms or within undissociated CO, scavenges H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, leaving behind carbonaceous deposits."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The observed low activity, carbon deposits, low 13C enrichment in hydrocarbons, and CO2 products, along with CO's promoting effect on aromatics selectivity, suggest that oxygen, either as atoms or within undissociated CO, scavenges H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, leaving behind carbon deposits.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
观察到的低活性、碳沉积、烃类中低于1.5%的13C富集以及CO2产品的现象，以及CO对芳烃选择性的促进作用，表明氧，作为原子或者未解离的CO，捕获了脱氢步骤中形成的H原子，留下了碳沉积物。
