Alkane conversion to aromatics occurs much more slowly because it is limited by rate of disposal of H-atoms formed in C-H scission steps and not by C-H bond activation. Kinetic coupling of these C-H activation steps with hydrogen transfer to acceptor sites (Ga n+, Zn m+) and ulti- mately to stoichiometric hydrogen acceptors (H+
+, CO2,
02, CO) often increases alkane activa- tion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products.

Reactions of 13CH4/C3H8 mixtures at 773 K lead only to unlabelled alkane, alkene, and aromatic products, even though exchange between CD4 and C3H8 occurs at these reaction conditions. This suggests that the non- oxidative conversion of CH4 to higher hydrocarbons on solid acids is limited by elementary steps that occur after the initial activation of C-H bonds.

The deuterium content in propane reaction products on H-ZSM5 is between 0.025 and 0.038, independent of propane conversion level, suggesting that most of the surface is covered by protium atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps. As a result, propane re-acquires H-atoms instead of D-atoms in most reversible dehydrogenation-hydrogenation steps, leading to slow exchange between C3H8 and D2.

The presence of Ga species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity. Turnover rates for overall propane conversion increase by a factor of about three, and the C6-C8 aromatics selectivity increases by about a factor of four, leading to a ten-fold increase in the rate of formation of aromatic molecules from propane.

The presence of molecular hydrogen acceptors such as CO2, CO, or 02 increases the selectivity of propane conversion to aromatics on H-ZSM5. Small amounts of O2 increase the initial selectivity from near zero to 12-13%, while CO2 increases the aromatics selectivity without any change in propane conversion turnover rates.

The deuterium content in methane reaction products on H-ZSM5 is higher than in propane, with the isotopic content being similar in all products. The rate of C-H bond activation for methane in this reactant mixture is about 20 times slower than that of propane, indicating that factors other than C-H bond strength must be involved in heterolytic C-H bond dissociation of light alkanes on acidic materials.

1. The rate of propane conversion to aromatics on H-ZSM5 is limited by the removal of H-atoms formed in required dehydrogenation steps, not by C-H bond activation. Ga n+ or Zn m+ cations can catalyze the recombination of H-adatoms species to form H2, increasing alkane activation rates and selectivity to unsaturated products.

2. The non-oxidative conversion of CH4 to higher hydrocarbons on solid acids is limited by steps that occur after the initial activation of C-H bonds. This implies that the activation of C-H bonds is not the rate-limiting step.

3. The deuterium content in propane reaction products on H-ZSM5 is consistently around 0.025 to 0.038, regardless of propane conversion level. This indicates that most of the surface is covered by protium atoms formed during dehydrogenation steps, preventing complete exchange between surface and gas phase hydrogen pools.

4. Ga species within zeolite channels significantly increase propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity. This is evidenced by a threefold increase in turnover rates for overall propane conversion and a fourfold increase in the C6-C8 aromatics selectivity.

5. Molecular hydrogen acceptors such as CO2, CO, or 02 can enhance the selectivity of propane conversion to aromatics on H-ZSM5. Adding O2 to the reaction mixture increases the initial selectivity to aromatics from near zero to 12-13%.

6. The rate of C-H bond activation for methane in a C3H8/CD4 reactant mixture is approximately 20 times slower than that of propane, suggesting that factors other than C-H bond strength influence the heterolytic C-H bond dissociation of light alkanes on acidic materials.

1. 在H-ZSM5基催化剂上，丙烷转化为芳香族化合物的速度较慢，主要受到形成C-H断裂步骤中氢原子的处理速率限制，而非C-H键的活化。这些活化步骤与氢转移至接受体（镓n+、锌m+）或最终至等效氢接受体（H+、CO2、O2、CO）的结合加速了烷烃的活化率和不饱和产物的选择性。

2. 在773 K下，13CH4/C3H8混合物仅产生未标记的烷烃、烯烃和芳香族产品，尽管CD4和C3H8之间的交换在这些反应条件下发生。这表明在固体酸上非氧化性将CH4转化为更高碳数的烷烃受制于在初始C-H键活化步骤之后发生的初级步骤。

3. 在H-ZSM5上，丙烷反应产物中的脱氘数在0.025到0.038之间，与丙烷转化水平无关，这说明大部分表面被在脱氢化步骤中形成的质子原子覆盖。因此，丙烷重新获取H原子而不是D原子，在大多数可逆脱氢化-氢化步骤中，导致C3H8与D2之间的缓慢交换。

4. 镓元素的存在显著提高了丙烷转化速率和芳烃选择性。总体上，丙烷转化速率增加了约三倍，C6-C8芳烃选择性增加了约四倍，导致从丙烷形成芳香分子的速率提高了十倍。

5. 分子氢接受剂如CO2、CO或O2可以增强H-ZSM5上丙烷转化为芳烃的选择性。向反应混合物中加入少量O2，初始选择性从接近零增加到12-13%。

6. C3H8/CD4反应混合物中甲烷的C-H键活化速率大约是丙烷的20倍，这表明除了C-H键强度外，其他因素影响了轻烷烃在酸性材料上的异裂C-H键解离。
