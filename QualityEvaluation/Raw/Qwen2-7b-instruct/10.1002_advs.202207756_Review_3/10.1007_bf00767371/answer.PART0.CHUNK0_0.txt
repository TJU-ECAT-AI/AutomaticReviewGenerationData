[1] "Na-ZSM5 (Zeochem, Si/A1 = 14.5) was converted to its protonic form by ammonium exchange and then impregnated with a gallium nitrate solution, dried at 373 K, and calcined at 623 K for 3 h [6]. This sample (2.0 wt% Ga) was reduced in flowing hydrogen at 823 K for I h before catalytic measurements."
[2] "Ga and Zn cations within zeolite channels can stabilize hydride ions formed in heterolytic dehydrogenation steps and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms (H + + H-) as H2 [7-9]."
[3] "The deuterium fraction is between 0.025 and 0.038 and independent of propane conversion level in all products of propane reactions on H-ZSM5 (fig. 1)."
[4] "On H-ZSM5, the predominant disposal pathway is the attachment of H-adatoms to hydrocarbon fragments, in steps that lower the selectivity to aro- matics by forming predominantly methane and ethane, products that do not form readily in carbocation rearrangements because they require formation of primary ions."
[5] "The presence of Ga species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (fig. 5). Turnover rates for overall propane conversion increase by a factor of about three (fig. 5) and the C6-C8 aromatics selectivity increases by about a factor of four, leading to a ten-fold increase in the rate of formation of aromatic molecules from propane."
[6] "Clearly, the stability of the carbocation and of its hydridic H-atom counterpart also influences C-H bond activation rates."
[7] "The extreme thermodynamic instability of primary carbocations may well require that C-H bond activation in CH4 proceed via pathways different from those involved in the activation of propane and larger alkanes, which can form more stable secondary and tertiary carbocations."
[8] "The products of 13CH4/C3H8 (20.0 kPa, 6.67 kPa, 773 K)reactant mixtures on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSMS, and Zn/H-ZSM5 are not labelled; about 5-10% 13C enrichment should occur if relative conversion rates of the two reactants paralleled their relative C-H bond activation rates on these catalysts."

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation of gallium hydrides. Gallium hydrides are stabilized by Ga species within zeolite channels, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2. This results in a higher rate of propane conversion and aromatics selectivity.

2. The stability of carbocations and their hydridic H-atom counterparts significantly affect the C-H bond activation rates. The extreme thermodynamic instability of primary carbocations necessitates alternative pathways for C-H bond activation in methane, different from those in propane and larger alkanes. 

3. The deuterium fraction in propane products remains constant regardless of propane conversion level, indicating a specific mechanism for hydrogen transfer and activation in propane reactions on H-ZSM5.

4. The predominant disposal pathway on H-ZSM5 involves attaching H-adatoms to hydrocarbon fragments, which reduces the selectivity for aromatic products by forming methane and ethane.

5. Ga-containing catalysts exhibit much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity compared to H-ZSM5 alone. The turnover rate for propane conversion increases by a factor of three, and the C6-C8 aromatics selectivity increases by a factor of four.

6. The stability of carbocations and their hydridic H-atom counterparts affects the C-H bond activation rates. The extreme thermodynamic instability of primary carbocations requires alternative pathways for C-H bond activation in methane.

7. The relative enrichment of 13C in the products of 13CH4/C3H8 mixtures on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5 is lower than expected if the conversion rates of the two reactants were proportional to their relative C-H bond activation rates. This suggests that the stability of carbocations and their hydridic H-atom counterparts plays a role in C-H bond activation in methane.

1. Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和骨架铝对密度在Ga修饰沸石催化剂中影响了镓氢化物的形成。Ga物种在沸石通道内稳定了镓氢化物，催化了H-原子的再组合脱附，形成了H2。这导致了丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性的提高。

2. 碳正离子及其氢化的H-原子的稳定性显著影响了C-H键活化速率。主碳正离子的极端热力学不稳定性要求甲烷中的C-H键活化通过与丙烷和较大烷烃中涉及的途径不同的途径进行，因为后者可以形成更稳定的二级和三级碳正离子。

3. 在H-ZSM5上，无论丙烷转化水平如何，丙烷产品的脱氘数保持不变，表明在丙烷反应中存在特定的氢转移和激活机制。

4. 在H-ZSM5上，主要的氢原子释放途径是将H-原子附加到烃碎片上，这降低了芳烃的选择性，因为它需要形成主要离子才能形成甲烷和乙烷。

5. 含有Ga的催化剂的丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性明显高于H-ZSM5。丙烷转化的周转率提高了三倍，C6-C8芳烃选择性增加了四倍。

6. 碳正离子及其氢化的H-原子的稳定性影响了C-H键活化速率。主碳正离子的极端热力学不稳定性要求甲烷中的C-H键活化通过与丙烷和较大烷烃中涉及的途径不同的途径进行。

7. 13CH4/C3H8混合物在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上的产物的相对富集程度低于预期，如果两种反应物的转化率与它们的相对C-H键活化速率成比例。这表明碳正离子及其氢化的H-原子的稳定性在甲烷中的C-H键活化中起作用。
