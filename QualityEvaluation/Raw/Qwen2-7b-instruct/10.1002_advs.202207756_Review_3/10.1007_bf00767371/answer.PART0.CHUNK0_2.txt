"Catalysis Letters 21 (1993) 55-70 55 Hydrogen transfer and activation of propane and methane on ZSM5-based catalysts Enrique Iglesia 1 and Joseph E. Baumgartner Corporate Research Laboratories, Exxon Research and Engineering, Route 22 East, Annandale, NJ08801, USA Received 12 April 1993;accepted 4 June 1993"

"Recent studies suggest that electrophilic activation of light alkanes occurs on superacid catalysts [1] and on Hg-based organometallic complexes [2] at low tem- peratures, and on weaker solid acids at higher temperatures [3-9], apparently via heterolytic cleavage of C-H bonds or intermediate partial oxidation of methane to methanol."

"In contrast, oxidative coupling of light alkanes occurs predominantly on basic metal oxides and involves homolytic processes and gas phase alkyl radi- cals, in which the activation of C-H bonds limit overall oxidative coupling rates [10-12]."

"Kinetic coupling of these C-H activation steps with hydrogen transfer to acceptor sites (Ga n+, Zn m+) and ulti- mately to stoichiometric hydrogen acceptors (H
+, CO2,
02, CO) often increases alkane activa- tion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products."

"Reactions of 13CH4/C3H8 mixtures at 773 K lead only to unlabelled alkane, alkene, and aromatic products, even though exchange between CD4 and C3H8 occurs at these reaction conditions."

"This suggests that the non- oxidative conversion of CH4 to higher hydrocarbons on solid acids is limited by elementary steps that occur after the initial activation of C-H bonds."

"The deuterium content in propane reaction products on H-ZSM5 increases linearly with contact time, but remains below 3% even at 25-30% propane chemical conversion levels."

"The distribution of D-atom isotopomers within each product obeys a binomial distribution,suggesting that multiple exchange events with a common surface hydrogen pool occur as an intrinsic process during one catalytic turnover."

"On H-ZSM5, this surface hydrogen pool contains 2.5-3.8% D and 96.2-97.5% H-atoms, not the 100% deuterium content expected from full equilibration with the pure D2 gas phase."

"Ga and Zn cations within zeolite channels can stabilize hydride ions formed in heterolytic dehydrogenation steps and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms (H + + H-) as H2."

"The presence of Ga species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity."

"The presence of 02, 13CO, or 13CO2 increases the selectivity of propane conversion to aromatics on H-ZSM5."

"The observed low activity and carbon deposits, the low level of t3C enrichment in hydrocarbons (< 1.5% 13C) and CO2 products, and the promoting effect of CO on aromatics selectivity suggest that oxygen, as atoms or within undissociated CO, scavenges H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."

"The products of 13CH4/C3H8 reactant mixtures on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSMS, and Zn/H-ZSM5 are not labelled; about 5-10% 13C enrichment should occur if relative conversion rates of the two reactants paralleled their relative C-H bond activation rates on these catalysts."

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation of gallium hydrides, which in turn affects the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The Ga cations can stabilize hydride ions formed in heterolytic dehydrogenation steps and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2, increasing the overall reaction rate.

2. The stability of C1 carbocations is influenced by the presence of alkyl or hydride acceptor species like Ga+, which provide thermodynamic sinks for hydrogen or carbon fragments of the C-H bond activation step, explaining the higher relative reactivity of C-H bonds in methane compared to propane on Ga/H-ZSM5.

3. The Ga species within zeolite channels lead to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity due to faster hydrogen desorption-adsorption steps.

4. The presence of oxygen in the form of O2, 13CO, or 13CO2 increases the selectivity of propane conversion to aromatics on H-ZSM5, suggesting that oxygen scavenges H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps.

5. The lack of labeling in the products of 13CH4/C3H8 reactant mixtures on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM, and Zn/H-ZSM indicates that the relative conversion rates of the two reactants do not parallel their relative C-H bond activation rates, likely due to the stability of C1 carbocations.

1. Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对数密度在Ga修饰沸石催化剂中影响了镓氢化物的形成，进而影响丙烷脱氢反应的结构活性相关性。镓离子可以稳定形成于异裂脱氢步骤中的氢离子，并催化氢原子的重新组合脱附，从而提高总体反应速率。

2. C1碳正离子的稳定性受存在如Ga+等烷基或氢接受物种的影响，这些物种为脱氢步骤中形成的氢或碳碎片提供了热力学上的吸收位点，解释了甲烷与丙烷相比在Ga/H-ZSM5上具有更高的相对氢键活性的原因。

3. 镓存在于沸石通道内的物种导致了丙烷转化率和芳香族选择性的显著提高，这是由于氢吸附-脱附步骤的速度更快。

4. 氧气以O2、13CO或13CO2的形式的存在增加了丙烷转化为芳香族产物的选择性在H-ZSM5上，表明氧气吸收了脱氢步骤中形成的氢原子。

5. 13CH4/C3H8反应物混合物在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM和Zn/H-ZSM上的产物缺乏标记，暗示了两种反应物的相对转化率与其相对氢键激活速率并不平行，这可能是由于C1碳正离子的稳定性所导致的。
