Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorp- tion, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D 2 into reaction products.

During propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga and Zn cations play key roles in accelerating the rates of propane chemical conversion, facilitating recombinative hydrogen desorption, and enhancing the incorporation of deuterium from D2 into products. The hydrogen generated from C-H bond activation is disposed of by transferring H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of multiple H-atoms during a single dehydrocyclodimerization cycle restricts the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

在H-ZSM5上进行丙烷脱氢环二聚化时，Ga和Zn离子在加速丙烷化学转化率、促进氢原子再组合释放以及增强D2产物中的掺入方面发挥着关键作用。从C-H键活化产生的氢通过将H原子转移到不饱和物种中形成烷烃或Ga和Zn物种中，以催化氢原子的再组合释放形成氢气（H2）。单个脱氢环二聚化循环中释放多个H原子限制了该反应在H-ZSM5上的速率和选择性。

The release of several hydrogen atoms in sequence during a single propane dehydrocyclodimerization cycle restricts the rate and selectivity of the reaction on H-ZSM5. Isotope studies demonstrate that C-H activation stages are rapid during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.

What are the roles and structures of metal cations, particularly gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn), in the light alkane reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5 zeolites?

</questions>

<quotes>
Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover. These monomeric species form directly during exchange of Zn ions from solution onto H-ZSM5. Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals. Ion exchange occurs during subsequent contact with propane or hydrogen at 700-800 K via vapor phase exchange of volatile GaI+ species.

Metal cations like gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn) enhance the rate of light alkane reactions, particularly propane dehydrocyclodimerization, on modified H-ZSM5 zeolites. They facilitate the conversion of propane to aromatic compounds, aid in the desorption of hydrogen, and enable the incorporation of deuterium into reaction products. Ga and Zn species are localized at cation exchange sites as monomeric ions, participating in redox cycles during dehydrocyclodimerization reactions. These ions catalyze the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms as dihydrogen (H2), which is crucial for maintaining the selectivity of the reaction. The sequential release of hydrogen atoms during a single dehydrocyclodimerization cycle affects the reaction rate and selectivity on H-ZSM5.

Significant cross exchange between C3H8 and C3D8 on H-ZSM5 occurs even at low chemical conversion levels (Fig. 10). C3H8/C3D8 cross-exchange occurs by stepwise transfer of single D or H-atoms, leading to statistical isotope distributions in both the mostly undeuterated and mostly deuterated components in 'unreacted' propane. Comparison of the rates of C-H bond activation and propane chemical conversion to products on H-ZSM5 suggests that C-H bond activation occurs much faster than propane conversion (Table 3). Thus, the C-H bond activation step is quasi-equilibrated and it does not limit the rate of the overall chemical conversion of propane on H-ZSM5.

Cross exchange between propane (C3H8) and deuterated propane (C3D8) on H-ZSM5 happens even at low conversion levels (Figure 10). This exchange involves the stepwise transfer of single deuterium (D) or hydrogen (H) atoms, leading to statistical isotope distributions in both the mostly undeuterated and mostly deuterated components in 'unreacted' propane. Comparing the rates of C-H bond activation and propane chemical conversion on H-ZSM5 reveals that C-H bond activation takes place much faster than propane conversion (Table 3). Hence, the C-H bond activation step reaches quasi-equilibrium and does not restrict the overall chemical conversion rate of propane on H-ZSM5.

在H-ZSM5上，丙烷(C3H8)与重水化的丙烷(C3D8)之间的交叉交换甚至在低化学转化水平下也会发生（图10）。这种交换涉及单个氘(D)或氢(H)原子的逐步转移，导致未反应丙烷中主要未标记和主要标记成分的统计同位素分布。比较H-ZSM5上C-H键活化率和丙烷产物生成速率（表3）显示，C-H键活化比丙烷转化快得多。因此，C-H键活化步骤达到准平衡状态，并且不会限制H-ZSM5上丙烷的总体化学转化速率。

The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C3+ carbocations. As the alkene chain lengthens, 13-scission reactions become faster and ultimately establish a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates with a broad size distribution [60,61]. These alkene intermediates continue to undergo hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, commonly described as hydrogen transfer, in which light alkenes accept hydrogen to form alkanes. C6+ alkenes tend to dehydrogenate and cyclize to kinetically-stable and thermodynamically-favored aromatic products. Cracking of larger chains also occurs with the concomitant removal of hydrogen by its addition to light alkene products of cracking reactions. These individual mechanistic proposals suggest that propane dehydrocyclodimerization occurs via a complex sequence of dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cracking, and cyclization steps (Scheme 1).

As the alkene chain grows longer, 13-scission reactions become faster, eventually creating a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates with a wide size distribution (Refs. 60, 61). These alkene intermediates continue to undergo hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, often referred to as hydrogen transfer, where light alkenes absorb hydrogen to form alkanes. C6+ alkenes tend to dehydrogenate and cyclize into kinetically stable and thermodynamically favored aromatic products. Larger chain cracking also occurs concurrently with hydrogen removal, which is added to the products of cracking reactions.
