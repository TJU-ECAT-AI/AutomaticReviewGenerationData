Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover. These monomeric species form directly during exchange of Zn ions from solution onto H-ZSM5. Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals. Ion exchange occurs during subsequent contact with propane or hydrogen at 700-800 K via vapor phase exchange of volatile GaI+ species.

Metal cations like gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn) enhance the rate of light alkane reactions, particularly propane dehydrocyclodimerization, on modified H-ZSM5 zeolites. They facilitate the conversion of propane to aromatic compounds, aid in the desorption of hydrogen, and enable the incorporation of deuterium into reaction products. Ga and Zn species are localized at cation exchange sites as monomeric ions, participating in redox cycles during dehydrocyclodimerization reactions. These ions catalyze the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms as dihydrogen (H2), which is crucial for maintaining the selectivity of the reaction. The sequential release of hydrogen atoms during a single dehydrocyclodimerization cycle affects the reaction rate and selectivity on H-ZSM5.

金属离子，特别是镓（Ga）和锌（Zn），在修改后的H-ZSM5沸石催化剂上促进了轻烷烃反应，特别是丙烷脱氢环二聚化。它们促进丙烷转化为芳香化合物，帮助氢原子的脱附，并使重水（D2）能够进入反应产物中。Ga和Zn物种位于阳离子交换位点，作为单体离子存在，在脱氢环二聚化反应中参与氧化还原循环。这些离子催化氢原子的重新组合脱附为氢气（H2），这对于保持反应的选择性至关重要。单个脱氢环二聚化周期中氢原子的连续释放影响了在H-ZSM5上的反应速率和选择性。

Significant cross exchange between C3H8 and C3D8 on H-ZSM5 occurs even at low chemical conversion levels (Fig. 10). C3H8/C3D8 cross-exchange occurs by stepwise transfer of single D or H-atoms, leading to statistical isotope distributions in both the mostly undeuterated and mostly deuterated components in 'unreacted' propane. Comparison of the rates of C-H bond activation and propane chemical conversion to products on H-ZSM5 suggests that C-H bond activation occurs much faster than propane conversion (Table 3). Thus, the C-H bond activation step is quasi-equilibrated and it does not limit the rate of the overall chemical conversion of propane on H-ZSM5.

Cross exchange between propane (C3H8) and deuterated propane (C3D8) on H-ZSM5 happens even at low conversion levels (Figure 10). This exchange involves the stepwise transfer of single deuterium (D) or hydrogen (H) atoms, leading to statistical isotope distributions in both the mostly undeuterated and mostly deuterated components in 'unreacted' propane. Comparing the rates of C-H bond activation and propane chemical conversion on H-ZSM5 reveals that C-H bond activation takes place much faster than propane conversion (Table 3). Hence, the C-H bond activation step reaches quasi-equilibrium and does not restrict the overall chemical conversion rate of propane on H-ZSM5.

在H-ZSM5上，丙烷(C3H8)与重水化的丙烷(C3D8)之间的交叉交换甚至在低化学转化水平下也会发生（图10）。这种交换涉及单个氘(D)或氢(H)原子的逐步转移，导致未反应丙烷中主要未标记和主要标记成分的统计同位素分布。比较H-ZSM5上C-H键活化率和丙烷产物生成速率（表3）显示，C-H键活化比丙烷转化快得多。因此，C-H键活化步骤达到准平衡状态，并且不会限制H-ZSM5上丙烷的总体化学转化速率。

The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C3+ carbocations. As the alkene chain lengthens, 13-scission reactions become faster and ultimately establish a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates with a broad size distribution [60,61]. These alkene intermediates continue to undergo hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, commonly described as hydrogen transfer, in which light alkenes accept hydrogen to form alkanes. C6+ alkenes tend to dehydrogenate and cyclize to kinetically-stable and thermodynamically-favored aromatic products. Cracking of larger chains also occurs with the concomitant removal of hydrogen by its addition to light alkene products of cracking reactions. These individual mechanistic proposals suggest that propane dehydrocyclodimerization occurs via a complex sequence of dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cracking, and cyclization steps (Scheme 1).

The initial propene intermediate, generated by the dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels through oligomerization or addition to C3+ carbocations. As the alkene chain grows longer, 13-scission reactions become faster, eventually creating a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates with a wide size distribution (Refs. 60, 61). These alkene intermediates continue to undergo hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, often referred to as hydrogen transfer, where light alkenes absorb hydrogen to form alkanes. C6+ alkenes tend to dehydrogenate and cyclize into kinetically stable and thermodynamically favored aromatic products. Larger chain cracking also occurs concurrently with hydrogen removal, which is added to the products of cracking reactions. These individual mechanisms indicate that propane dehydrocyclodimerization takes place through a complex sequence of dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cracking, and cyclization steps (Scheme 1).

初始丙烯中间体，由丙烷脱氢生成，通过络合物化或添加到C3+碳正离子中，在沸石通道内通过聚合物化或加成反应进行酸催化链增长反应。随着烯烃链的增长，13裂解反应加速，最终形成包含广泛尺寸分布的准平衡烯烃中间体池（参考文献60、61）。这些烯烃中间体继续经历氢化脱氢反应，通常被称为氢转移，其中轻烯烃吸收氢形成烷烃。C6+烯烃倾向于脱氢并环化成动力学稳定和热力学优选的芳香族产品。较大的链裂解也同时伴随着氢的去除，氢被添加到裂解反应产物中。这些单独的机制表明，丙烷脱氢环二聚化通过复杂的脱氢、聚合、裂解和环化步骤序列发生（方案1）。
