How do the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and what do these relationships reveal about the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions?

The Ga cations increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对数密度在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种的形成和性质。镓离子增加了丙烷化学转化、重组合氢脱附以及从D2到反应产物的氘集成率。在C-H键活化步骤形成的氢通过将H原子转移到不饱和物种形成烷烃或到Ga和Zn物种，这些物种催化重组合氢脱附形成氢气(H2)。这揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性关系，催化剂的特性决定了氢管理效率和转化途径。
