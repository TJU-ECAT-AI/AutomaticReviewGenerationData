The Ga content in metal-exchanged H-ZSM5 was measured to have 2.1 wt% (Ga/A1 = 0.29). 
The atomic Si/A1 ratio in the Zeochem material was 14.5. This value remained constant throughout all exchange procedures and thermal treatments of the samples. 
The Zn content in ion exchanged Zn/H-ZSM5 was 1.3 wt%. Zn, which corresponds to a Zn/A1 atomic ratio of 0.20 in this sample. 
During X-ray absorption measurements, Ga K-edges were fitted by linear combinations of spectra from well characterized Ga 3+ compounds and from Ga metal. The resulting best fit gave the fraction of the Ga present in various reduced and oxidized states. 
Gallium cations were introduced by incipient wetness impregnation into H-ZSM5 with a 0.065 M solution of gallium nitrate. 
The structure and chemical state of Ga and Zn species in calcined Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 samples were examined by in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ga and Zn K-edges. 
The rate of propane conversion turnover on Zn/H-ZSM5 increased from 0.13 to 0.254 per AI site when Zn was ion-exchanged onto H-ZSM5. 
The rate of propane conversion turnover on Ga/H-ZSM5 increased from 0.06 to 25.4 per AI site when Ga was introduced into H-ZSM5.
