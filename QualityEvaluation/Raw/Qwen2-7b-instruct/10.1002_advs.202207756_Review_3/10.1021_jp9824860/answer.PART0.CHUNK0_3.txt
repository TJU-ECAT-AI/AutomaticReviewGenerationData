[1] "The restricted channel environment in ZSM5 1,2 and the ability of these catalysts to maintain a high hydrogen surface pressure during alkane reactions 3,4 inhibit carbon formation and lead to their unique stability at the high temperatures and low H2 concentration required for aromatization of alkanes."
[2] "The elemental composition of all samples was obtained by atomic emission spectroscopy (Galbraith Laboratories). The atomic Si/Al ratio was 14.5  0.9."
[3] "Propane conversion turnovers are reported as the molar rate of propane conversion per g-atom Al in the catalyst charge."
[4] "The initial rate of methane formation (7.7 × 10-4 s-1) is faster than the initial rate of propene formation (3.0 × 10-4 s-1)."
[5] "At low conversions, aromatic products, consisting of a mixture of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and a low concentration of larger aromatics, form slowly."
[6] "These alkene reactions are necessary to explain the distribution of aromatic products. Products of propane-2-13C reactions on HZSM5 contain binomial distributions of 13C-atoms."
[7] "The reaction network shown in Scheme 4 is consistent with our results and with previous studies of acid-catalyzed reactions.5,6 Propene, initially formed via a dehydrogenation of propane, and ethene, initially formed from propane cracking, undergo rapid acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or by addition to C3+ carbocations formed directly from propane."

1. The Si/Al ratio in the catalyst samples was determined to be around 14.5, with a standard deviation of 0.9.
2. The propane conversion turnovers are calculated based on the molar rate of propane conversion per gram of aluminum atoms in the catalyst charge.
3. The formation rate of methane is significantly higher than that of propene at the beginning of the reaction.
4. At low conversion levels, aromatic products, including benzene, toluene, xylenes, and a small amount of larger aromatics, start forming gradually.
5. The alkene reactions, including rapid oligomerization and β-scission cycles, are crucial in explaining the distribution of aromatic products in propane reactions on HZSM5.
6. The products resulting from propane-2-13C reactions on HZSM5 exhibit binomial distributions of 13C atoms, indicating rapid alkene reactions.
7. The reaction sequence depicted in Scheme 4 aligns with the observed outcomes and parallels previous studies on acid-catalyzed reactions, involving the formation of propene from propane dehydrogenation and ethene from propane cracking, followed by rapid acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels.
