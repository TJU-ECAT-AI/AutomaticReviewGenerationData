[1] "Reactions of positionally labeled alkanes can be used to study the mechanism of cyclization reactions."
[2] "Specifically, the analysis of the content and location of 13C in the products of propane-2-13C reactions can establish the reaction pathways required for the conversion of propene intermediates to stable aromatic products."
[3] "Disappointingly, all information about the location and content of 13C-atoms in the propane-2-13C is lost during an aromatization turnover on HZSM5."
[4] "Even at low conversion, all aromatic products of propane-2-13C reactions on HZSM5 show a binomial distribution of 13C-atoms, instead of the single isotopomer expected from propene dimerization and hexene cyclization."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are complex. The specific relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density and the formation of active gallium species are not detailed in the literature provided. The focus of the study is on the propane reaction pathways and the role of 13C isotopes in understanding the mechanism of propane aromatization on HZSM5 zeolites.
