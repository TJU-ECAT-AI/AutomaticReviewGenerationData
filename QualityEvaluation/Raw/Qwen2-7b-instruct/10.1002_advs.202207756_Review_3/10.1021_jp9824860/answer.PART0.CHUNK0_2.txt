<p>On HZSM5, the initial products of propane conversion at 773 K are primarily propene, H2, and equimolar amounts of ethene and methane. Small amounts of ethane and aromatics are also formed initially (<5%). The initial rate of methane formation (7.7 × 10-4 s-1) is faster than the initial rate of propene formation (3.0 × 10-4 s-1). Ethene and propene are formed with high selectivity at low conversions and decrease with increasing conversion as they are converted to more stable products (e.g. aromatics, alkanes).</p>
<p>At low conversions, aromatic products, consisting of a mixture of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and a low concentration of larger aromatics, form slowly. The predominant aromatic product of propane is not benzene, the expected product of c simple dimerization steps, but toluene. Aromatic concentrations increase with conversion because aromatics are secondary products of propane.</p>
<p>Reactions of positionally labeled alkanes can be used to study the mechanism of cyclization reactions. Specifically, the analysis of the content and location of 13C in the products of propane-2-13C reactions can establish the reaction pathways required for the conversion of propene intermediates to stable aromatic products. For example, a simple cyclization of two propene-2-13C molecules formed from propane-2-13C would lead to benzene-1,4-13C in the absence of intramolecular scrambling.</p>

1. The initial products of propane conversion on HZSM5 include propene, H2, ethene, and methane. Methane forms faster than propene. Ethene and propene exhibit high selectivity at low conversions, decreasing with increasing conversion as they transform into more stable products like aromatics and alkanes.

2. At low conversions, aromatic products like benzene, toluene, xylenes, and smaller aromatics form slowly. Toluene is the predominant aromatic product of propane. Aromatic concentrations rise with conversion due to the secondary nature of aromatics in propane reactions.

3. The analysis of the content and location of 13C in the products of propane-2-13C reactions can determine the reaction pathways needed for the transformation of propene intermediates into stable aromatic products. For instance, the cyclization of two propene-2-13C molecules from propane-2-13C would yield benzene-1,4-13C without intramolecular scrambling.

4. The document does not provide details on how the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts affect the formation and characteristics of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides.

1. 在HZSM5上，丙烷转化的初期产物包括丙烯、H2、乙烯和甲烷。甲烷的形成速度比丙烯快。在低转化率下，乙烯和丙烯具有较高的选择性，随着转化率的增加，它们会转化为更稳定的产物如芳烃和烷烃。

2. 在低转化率下，混合物形式的苯、邻二甲苯、间二甲苯和少量较大的芳烃缓慢形成。邻二甲苯是丙烷转化的主要芳香产物。随着转化率的增加，由于芳香化合物是丙烷反应的次要产物，芳香浓度会上升。

3. 对于13C在丙烷-2-13C反应产物中的含量和位置的分析，可以确定将丙烯中间体转化为稳定芳香产品的反应路径。例如，从丙烷-2-13C形成的两个丙烯-2-13C分子的简单环化会导致苯-1,4-13C，而不会出现分子内重排。

4. 文档没有提供关于镓/铝比例、Si/Al比例和框架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中如何影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和特性的信息。
