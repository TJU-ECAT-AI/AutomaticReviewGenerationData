2.1. Catalyst Preparation. Na+ ions in NaZSM5 (Zeochem) were replaced with NH4+ by contacting the zeolite with a solution of 0.67 M NH4NO3 (Fisher, Certified ACS, >98.0%) at 353 K for 10 h. Solids were separated from the solution by filtering. The exchange procedure was repeated three times using fresh NH4NO3 solutions in order to ensure complete exchange of Na cations (residual Na content < 0.07% by elemental analysis). The catalyst samples were then dried in flowing air at 383 K for 20 h and calcined in flowing air at 773 K for 20 h in order to decompose NH4+ to H+, which resulted in the acidic form of the zeolite (HZSM5).

2.2. Catalytic Reaction Studies. Kinetic studies on HZSM5 catalysts were performed in a gradientless recirculating reactor operated in batch mode. Chemical compositions of reaction products were measured as a function of reaction time and reactant conversion. The reaction mixture was circulated using a graphite gear micropump (250 cm3 min-1, Cole-Parmer) that allowed differential reactor operation (<2% reactant conversion per pass). All propane reactions were carried out at 773 K.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the surface acidity and pore structure of the catalyst. These factors are crucial in determining the efficiency and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation reactions. A higher Si/Al ratio typically leads to a more acidic surface, which enhances the dehydrogenation of propane to form propene. The framework aluminum pair density affects the stability of the catalyst and its ability to maintain a high hydrogen surface pressure during alkane reactions, which is essential for the stability of the catalyst at high temperatures and low hydrogen concentration required for aromatization of alkanes. These relationships reveal the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions, showing that the catalyst's properties significantly impact the formation of desired products.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物，通过影响催化剂的表面酸性和孔结构。这些因素对于确定丙烷脱氢反应的效率和选择性至关重要。较高的Si/Al比通常导致更酸性的表面，这增强了丙烷的脱氢形成丙烯。框架铝对密度影响催化剂的稳定性和其维持高氢表面压力的能力，这对于在高温和低氢浓度下进行烷烃反应所需的稳定性是必要的。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应的结构-活性相关性，表明催化剂的性质显著影响所需产物的形成。
