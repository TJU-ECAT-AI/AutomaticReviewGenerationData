To investigate how the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, we refer to the following insights:

1. The restricted channel environment in ZSM5 and the capability of these catalysts to maintain a high hydrogen surface pressure during alkane reactions inhibit carbon formation, leading to unique stability at high temperatures and low hydrogen concentration required for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The elemental composition of the samples was determined using atomic emission spectroscopy.

3. Propane conversion rates are reported as the molar rate of propane conversion per gram of aluminum atoms in the catalyst charge.

4. The initial products of propane conversion at 773 K on HZSM5 are primarily propene, hydrogen, and equal amounts of ethene and methane.

5. The chemical composition of reaction mixtures was obtained through capillary column gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and electron-impact mass spectrometry.

6. The elemental composition of all samples was obtained by atomic emission spectroscopy.

7. Propane conversion rates are reported as the molar rate of propane conversion per gram of aluminum atoms in the catalyst charge.

8. The chemical composition of reaction mixtures was obtained using capillary column gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and electron-impact mass spectrometry.

9. The elemental composition of all samples was obtained by atomic emission spectroscopy.

10. Propane conversion rates are reported as the molar rate of propane conversion per gram of aluminum atoms in the catalyst charge.

11. The chemical composition of reaction mixtures was obtained through capillary column gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and electron-impact mass spectrometry.

These findings provide a basis for understanding the structure-activity relationships in propane dehydrogenation reactions, particularly concerning the influence of catalyst properties on the formation of active gallium species and gallium hydrides.
