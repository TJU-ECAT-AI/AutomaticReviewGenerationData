<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, such as gallium hydrides, in propane dehydrogenation reactions. These relationships shed light on the structure-activity correlations within the catalyst.
