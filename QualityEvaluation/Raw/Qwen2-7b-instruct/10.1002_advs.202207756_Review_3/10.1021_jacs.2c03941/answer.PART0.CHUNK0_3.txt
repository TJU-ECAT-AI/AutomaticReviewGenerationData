[1] "In the study, we investigated the effect of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts."
[2] "The results showed that an optimized Ga/Al ratio could lead to more stable gallium hydrides, which are crucial for the activation of propane molecules during dehydrogenation."
[3] "A higher Si/Al ratio was found to enhance the dispersion of gallium species, thus improving the efficiency of propane conversion."
[4] "Framework aluminum pair density was found to correlate with the reactivity of the catalyst, as a higher density facilitated faster reaction kinetics."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. An optimized Ga/Al ratio leads to more stable gallium hydrides, enhancing the activation of propane molecules during dehydrogenation. A higher Si/Al ratio improves the dispersion of gallium species, increasing the efficiency of propane conversion. Framework aluminum pair density correlates with catalyst reactivity, as a higher density facilitates faster reaction kinetics.
