[1] "Ga+-Chabazite Zeolite: A Highly Selective Catalyst for Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation"
[2] "The structure of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts is characterized by a high Ga/Al ratio, a high Si/Al ratio, and a high framework aluminum pair density."
[3] "The formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the aforementioned ratios."
[4] "These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are closely tied to the specific characteristics of the Ga-modified zeolite catalysts."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly impact the formation and nature of active gallium species, such as gallium hydrides. These relationships indicate that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are intricately linked to the specific features of the Ga-modified zeolite catalysts.
