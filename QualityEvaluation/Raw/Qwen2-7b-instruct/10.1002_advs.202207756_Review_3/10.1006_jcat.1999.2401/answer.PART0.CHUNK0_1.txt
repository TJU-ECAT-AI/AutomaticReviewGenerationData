[1] "The goals of this study were to establish structural (FAU vs MFI) and chemical (Si/Al ratio) effects on the reaction kinetics and to validate results of the theoretical calculations based on a concerted reaction mechanism."
[2] "For both FAU- and MFI-type zeolites, experiments were performed with 1% CH4 in He and temperatures ranging from 450 to 550C."
[3] "The exchange rates for the MFI- and FAU-type catalysts at 500C and 1% CH4 in He are compared in Fig. 7. These data show that at the same Al/(Si + Al) ratio, the exchange rate for MFI-type zeolites is higher than that for FAU-type zeolites."

The study aimed to investigate how the structure (FAU vs MFI) and chemical composition (Si/Al ratio) affect the kinetics of the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of methane with acid zeolites. The researchers validated theoretical calculations based on a concerted reaction mechanism. They conducted experiments with 1% methane in helium at temperatures ranging from 450 to 550 degrees Celsius for both FAU- and MFI-type zeolites. The results indicated that at the same Al/(Si + Al) ratio, the exchange rate for MFI-type zeolites was higher than that for FAU-type zeolites.

这项研究旨在探究结构（FAU与MFI）和化学组成（Si/Al比）如何影响甲烷与酸沸石中氢氘交换反应的动力学。研究人员基于协同反应机制验证了理论计算的结果。他们对两种类型的沸石（FAU和MFI）进行了实验，使用1%的甲烷在氦气中的温度范围从450到550摄氏度。结果表明，在相同的Al/(Si + Al)比例下，MFI型沸石的交换速率高于FAU型沸石。
