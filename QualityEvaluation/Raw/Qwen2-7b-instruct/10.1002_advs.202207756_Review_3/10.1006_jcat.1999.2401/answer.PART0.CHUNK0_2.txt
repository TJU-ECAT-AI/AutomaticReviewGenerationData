[1] "The kinetics of the consecutive HD exchange reactions between methane and deuterated acid FAU- and MFI-type zeolites was stud- ied with on-line mass spectrometric product analysis, in the temper- ature range 450 to 550C."
[2] "On both zeolite types, the rate constant of HD exchange increases with decreasing Al content."
[3] "At the same Al content, the reaction rate constant of MFI is ca. three times larger than that of FAU, showing that chemical composition and struc- tural effects are important in determining the rate of exchange."
[4] "The apparent activation energy is in the range 122150 kJ/mol, independent of the Al content and structure type."
[5] "A kinetic isotope effectofapproximately1.7wasfound,whichisindisagreementwith the earlier proposed concerted reaction mechanism."

The study focused on the consecutive HD exchange reactions between methane and deuterated acid FAU- and MFI-type zeolites within the temperature range of 450 to 550°C. The rate constant of the HD exchange reaction increases with decreasing Al content. The reaction rate constant for MFI-type zeolites is approximately three times higher than that for FAU-type zeolites at the same Al content, indicating the significance of both chemical composition and structure in determining the exchange rate. The apparent activation energy for the HD exchange reaction was found to be within the range of 122 to 150 kJ/mol, independent of the Al content and structure type. A kinetic isotope effect of about 1.7 was observed, which contradicts the earlier proposed concerted reaction mechanism.

研究关注了在450至550°C温度范围内，甲烷与酸性FAU和MFI型沸石之间的连续HD交换反应。随着Al含量的降低，HD交换反应速率常数增加。相同Al含量下，MFI型沸石的反应速率常数约为FAU型沸石的三倍，表明化学组成和结构对交换速率具有重要影响。在相同的Al含量下，HD交换反应的表观活化能位于122至150 kJ/mol的范围内，与Al含量和结构类型无关。观察到的同位素效应约为1.7，这与先前提出的协同反应机制不符。
