The exchange rates for the MFI- and FAU-type catalysts at 500C and 1% CH4 in He are compared in Fig. 7. These data show that at the same Al/(Si + Al) ratio, the exchange rate for MFI-type zeolites is higher than that for FAU-type zeolites. This indicates that structure is important in determining the activity per site.

The comparison of exchange rates for MFI and FAU zeolites at 500°C and 1% methane in He reveals that at the same Al/(Si + Al) ratio, MFI zeolites exhibit a higher exchange rate. This suggests that the structure plays a significant role in determining the activity per site.

在500°C和1%甲烷在He中的情况下，对MFI和FAU沸石的交换率进行比较显示，在相同的Al/(Si + Al)比率下，MFI沸石的交换速率更高。这表明结构在决定单个站点活性方面起着重要作用。

For both FAU- and MFI-type zeolites, experiments were performed with 1% CH4 in He and temperatures ranging from 450 to 550C. Ln(k) was plotted versus 1/T in an Arrhenius plot and the apparent activation energy for the HD exchange reaction was calculated using the Arrhenius equation. The experimental values for the apparent activation energy were found to be in the range of 122150 kJ/mol (Table 2), whatever the type of the zeolite and the Si/Al ratio.

For both FAU and MFI zeolites, experiments were carried out with 1% methane in He and temperatures between 450 and 550°C. The natural logarithm of the rate constant (ln(k)) was plotted against 1/T in an Arrhenius diagram, and the apparent activation energy for the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction was determined using the Arrhenius equation. The calculated apparent activation energies ranged from 122 to 150 kJ/mol, regardless of the type of zeolite and the Si/Al ratio (Table 2).

无论是FAU还是MFI型沸石，都进行了1%甲烷在He中以及温度在450至550°C之间的实验。将自然对数的速率常数(ln(k))与1/T绘制在Arrhenius图上，并使用Arrhenius方程计算了氢氘交换反应的表观活化能。无论沸石类型和Si/Al比如何，计算得到的表观活化能范围为122至150 kJ/mol（表2）。
