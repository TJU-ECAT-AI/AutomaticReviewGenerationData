[1] "The goals of this study were to establish structural (FAU vs MFI) and chemical (Si/Al ratio) effects on the reaction kinetics and to validate results of the theoretical calculations based on a concerted reaction mechanism."
[2] "For both FAU- and MFI-type zeolites, experiments were performed with 1% CH4 in He and temperatures ranging from 450 to 550C. Ln(k) was plotted versus 1/T in an Arrhenius plot and the apparent activation energy for the HD exchange reaction was calculated using the Arrhenius equation."
[3] "When the transition state of the concerted reaction mechanism is frozen into the FAU and MFI structures, the influence of chemical composition (Si/Al ratio) and structure (MFI vs FAU) can be studied with the electronegativity equalization method (EEM)."
[4] "The exchange rates for the MFI- and FAU-type catalysts at 500C and 1% CH4 in He are compared in Fig. 7. These data show that at the same Al/(Si + Al) ratio, the exchange rate for MFI-type zeolites is higher than that for FAU-type zeolites."

1. The objectives of the study were to investigate the effects of zeolite structure (FAU versus MFI) and chemical composition (Si/Al ratio) on the kinetics of the HD exchange reaction and to confirm the theoretical predictions based on a concerted reaction mechanism.

2. Apparent activation energies for the HD exchange reaction were determined using Arrhenius plots with logarithmic plots of ln(k) versus 1/T for FAU and MFI zeolites at various temperatures and 1% methane concentration.

3. The electronegativity equalization method (EEM) was utilized to assess the impact of chemical composition (Si/Al ratio) and structure (MFI versus FAU) on the HD exchange reaction, particularly by freezing the transition state of the concerted reaction mechanism into the FAU and MFI structures.

4. Comparative studies of MFI- and FAU-type catalysts at 500°C and 1% methane concentration revealed that MFI zeolites exhibit higher exchange rates than FAU zeolites when the Al/(Si + Al) ratio is the same.

1. 研究的目标是确定结构（FAU与MFI）和化学组成（Si/Al比）对HD交换反应动力学的影响，并验证基于协同反应机制的理论计算结果。

2. 对于FAU和MFI型沸石，通过在不同温度和1%甲烷浓度下进行实验，绘制以1/T为横坐标、ln(k)为纵坐标的Arrhenius图来计算HD交换反应的表观活化能。

3. 通过将协同反应机制的过渡状态冻结到FAU和MFI结构中，使用电负性等价方法（EEM）研究化学组成（Si/Al比）和结构（MFI与FAU）对HD交换反应的影响。

4. 在500°C和1%甲烷浓度下，比较MFI和FAU型催化剂的实验结果发现，在相同的Al/(Si + Al)比条件下，MFI沸石的交换速率高于FAU沸石。
