          [1] "The influence of the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on the formation and nature of active gallium species was investigated in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts."
          [2] "A higher Ga/Al ratio resulted in an increased formation of gallium hydrides, which were found to be more active in propane dehydrogenation."
          [3] "The Si/Al ratio had a significant effect on the stability of the gallium species, with higher ratios leading to decreased activity due to the potential formation of less stable gallium silicates."
          [4] "Framework aluminum pair density was found to correlate with the dispersion of gallium species, affecting their accessibility and thus their reactivity in the dehydrogenation process."
          [5] "These relationships revealed strong structure-activity correlations in the context of propane dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of fine-tuning the catalyst's composition for optimal performance."

          The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. A higher Ga/Al ratio promotes the formation of more active gallium hydrides, whereas the Si/Al ratio impacts the stability of these species, potentially leading to decreased activity through the formation of less stable gallium silicates. Framework aluminum pair density affects the dispersion of gallium species, impacting their reactivity and accessibility during the propane dehydrogenation process. These findings highlight the importance of carefully tuning the catalyst's composition to achieve optimal performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

          在Ga修饰沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度显著影响活性镓物种（尤其是镓氢化物）的形成和性质。较高的Ga/Al比促进更多活性镓氢化物的形成，而Si/Al比影响这些物种的稳定性，可能通过形成较不稳定的镓硅酸盐导致活性降低。框架铝对密度影响镓物种的分散，影响其在脱氢过程中的可接近性和反应性。这些发现强调了精确调整催化剂组成以实现最优性能的重要性。
