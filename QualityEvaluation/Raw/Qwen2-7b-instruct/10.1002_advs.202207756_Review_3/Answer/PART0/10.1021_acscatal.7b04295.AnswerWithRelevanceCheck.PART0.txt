          The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species. Specifically, the Ga/Al ratio affects the formation of gallium species, the Si/Al ratio impacts the catalyst's structure influencing the stability of these species, and the framework aluminum pair density correlates with the reactivity of the gallium species. These relationships reveal the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
