The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly impact the formation and characteristics of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. These factors correlate with the structure-activity relationships observed during nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. An optimized Ga/Al ratio leads to more stable gallium hydrides, enhancing the activation of propane molecules during dehydrogenation. A higher Si/Al ratio improves the dispersion of gallium species, increasing the efficiency of propane conversion. Framework aluminum pair density correlates with catalyst reactivity, as a higher density facilitates faster reaction kinetics.
