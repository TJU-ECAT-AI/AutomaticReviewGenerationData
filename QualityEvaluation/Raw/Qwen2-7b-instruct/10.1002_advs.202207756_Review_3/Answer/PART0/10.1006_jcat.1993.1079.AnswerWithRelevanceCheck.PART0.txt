          [1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
          [2] "Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions."
          [3] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
          [4] "These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5."
          [5] "Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions."

          The formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. These factors determine the structure of the catalyst, which in turn affects the chemical state of gallium. During the conversion of alkanes to aromatics, gallium species catalyze the rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps. Initially, Ga+3 species are present in fresh catalysts, which reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. The reduced Ga is present in a highly dispersed form, possibly as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Active forms of gallium exist only at reaction conditions, as the reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2.

          在Ga修饰的沸石催化剂中，活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质受Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率以及框架铝对密度的影响。这些因素决定了催化剂的结构，从而影响镓的化学状态。在将烷烃转化为芳香族化合物的过程中，镓物种催化速率决定性的脱氢步骤。在新鲜催化剂中，最初存在Ga+3物种，在770 K以下的温度下，通过氢预处理或丙烷反应期间进行还原。还原的Ga以高度分散的形式存在，可能作为与沸石通道内的基本氧原子配位的单体氢化物物种。这些氢化物物种通过在H-ZSM5上的丙烷脱氢环二聚化过程中表面氢分压的升高而释放分子氢。只有在反应条件下，活性的镓形式才存在，因为还原的Ga物种在流动H2中冷却至室温时重新氧化为Ga+3。
