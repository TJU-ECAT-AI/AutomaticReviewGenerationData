[1] "Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts with Ga/Al ratios of 0.05 to 0.22 were prepared by aqueous exchange."
[2] "The Ga content in the exchanged samples was controlled by varying the exchange time of H-ZSM5 with a 0.05 M Ga(NO3)2 solution between 2 and 16 hours."
[3] "The Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts showed enhanced dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization activities for alkanes compared to H-ZSM5."
[4] "Infrared and D2OH exchange measurements showed that each Ga atom replaced approximately 1.1 to 1.3 zeolitic H+."
[5] "Ga species were localized at specific sites within the zeolite framework, which influenced the structure and activity of the catalyst."
[6] "No significant H2 consumption was detected up to 1273 K in any of the Ga/H-ZSM5 samples, consistent with the absence of GaOx crystallites."
[7] "In situ near-edge X-ray absorption studies confirmed that Ga species remained as divalent cations during exposure to H2 or C3H8 at 773 K."
[8] "The radial structure functions of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM5 samples showed weak contributions from coordination shells beyond the initial GaO shell, indicating a non-uniform distribution of distances and orientations in Al-Al next-nearest neighbor pairs."
[9] "The structure-activity relationships revealed that the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, affecting the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by determining the localization of Ga atoms within the zeolite framework. This influences the structure and activity of the catalyst, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The Ga species are localized at specific sites, and the degree of hydration affects the structure and reactivity of the catalyst. The non-uniform distribution of distances and orientations in Al-Al next-nearest neighbor pairs contributes to the formation of well-dispersed Ga2+ cations, which remain as divalent cations during exposure to H2 or C3H8 at 773 K. The structure-activity correlations highlight the importance of these factors in optimizing the catalyst's performance for alkane dehydrogenation processes.

在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度影响活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。这些因素决定了Ga原子在沸石骨架中的定位，从而影响催化剂的结构和活性，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中。Ga物种定位在特定位置，其水合程度影响催化剂的结构和反应性。Al-Al近邻对之间非均匀的距离和方向分布导致形成分散良好的Ga2+离子，这些离子在暴露于773 K的H2或C3H8时保持为二价离子。结构活性相关性强调了这些因素在优化催化剂性能以进行烷烃脱氢过程的重要性。
