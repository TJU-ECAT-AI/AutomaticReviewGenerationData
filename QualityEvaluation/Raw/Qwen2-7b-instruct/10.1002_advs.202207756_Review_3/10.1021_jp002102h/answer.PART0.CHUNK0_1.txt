Structure and Properties of Cobalt-Exchanged H-ZSM5 Catalysts for Dehydrogenation and Dehydrocyclization of Alkanes:

The study investigates the structure and properties of cobalt-exchanged H-ZSM5 catalysts, focusing on their enhanced performance in dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization of alkanes compared to H-ZSM5. The catalysts exhibit higher turnover rates for the conversion of propane to propene and to C6-C8 aromatics. They also display higher selectivities to propene, aromatics, and hydrogen (H2).

The density and structure of cobalt (Co) species in the catalysts are studied through temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), deuterium (D2) isotopic exchange, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The results indicate that Co2+ cations replace 1.1 to 1.3 zeolitic protons, suggesting the presence of Co2+ monomers and dimers bridging two next-nearest neighbor aluminum (Al) sites. The location and structure of the exchanged Co cations are further explored using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). No H2 consumption was detected up to 1273 K, indicating the absence of cobalt oxide (CoOx) clusters, which reduces below 1000 K.

The catalysts also show a decrease in the concentration of surface hydrogen atoms during propane reactions, leading to increased propene and aromatics selectivities and decreased C1-C2 selectivities with increasing Co content. This behavior is consistent with the role of Co cations in desorbing hydrogen as H2, which is crucial for the relief of kinetic bottlenecks and the acceleration of alkane reaction pathways.

In summary, the cobalt-exchanged H-ZSM5 catalysts demonstrate improved performance in alkane dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization due to the enhanced capabilities of cobalt cations in hydrogen desorption and catalysis. The structure and properties of these catalysts are closely correlated with their enhanced activity and selectivity in alkane reactions.

结构和性质钴交换H-ZSM5催化剂在脱氢和烷烃环化中的应用：

研究了钴交换H-ZSM5催化剂的结构和性质，重点考察了它们在烷烃脱氢和环化反应中相对于H-ZSM5的增强性能。催化剂表现出更高的丙烷转化为丙烯和C6-C8芳烃的转化率。它们也显示出对丙烯、芳烃和氢（H2）更高的选择性。

通过温度程序还原（TPR）、氘（D2）同位素交换、红外光谱和X射线吸收光谱（XAS）研究了催化剂中钴（Co）物种的密度和结构。结果表明，Co2+离子替代了1.1到1.3个沸石质羟基，暗示存在Co2+单体和二聚体桥接两个相邻的铝（Al）原子。使用X射线吸收光谱（XAS）和温度程序还原（TPR）进一步探索了交换Co原子的位置和结构。未检测到高达1273 K的H2消耗，表明不存在可还原的钴氧化物（CoOx）簇，这些簇在1000 K以下会还原。

催化剂还表现出降低表面氢原子浓度的趋势，在丙烷反应过程中，导致丙烯和芳烃选择性的增加以及C1-C2选择性的降低，随Co含量的增加而增加。这种行为与Co离子在氢脱附和催化作用中增强的能力一致，这对于缓解动力学瓶颈并加速烷烃反应途径至关重要。

综上所述，钴交换H-ZSM5催化剂在烷烃脱氢和环化反应中表现出改进的性能，这归因于Co离子增强的氢脱附能力和催化作用。这些催化剂的结构和性质与其在烷烃反应中的增强活性和选择性密切相关。
