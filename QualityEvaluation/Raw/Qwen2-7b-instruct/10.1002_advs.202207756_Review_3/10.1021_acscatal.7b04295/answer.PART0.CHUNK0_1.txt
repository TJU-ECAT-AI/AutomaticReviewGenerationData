[1] "The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts were systematically varied."
[2] "It was found that the Ga/Al ratio had a significant impact on the formation of gallium species."
[3] "The Si/Al ratio influenced the structure of the catalyst, which in turn affected the stability of the gallium species."
[4] "Framework aluminum pair density was observed to correlate with the reactivity of the gallium species."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species. Specifically, the Ga/Al ratio affects the formation of gallium species, the Si/Al ratio impacts the catalyst's structure influencing the stability of these species, and the framework aluminum pair density correlates with the reactivity of the gallium species. These relationships reveal the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
