The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by determining the stability and reactivity of these species. A higher Ga/Al ratio leads to more Ga species, enhancing catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Al ratio ensures a balanced structure supporting Ga species and the overall framework. Framework aluminum pair density affects the spatial arrangement of Ga atoms, impacting their coordination and reactivity.
