Periodic DFT calculations show that stability of binuclear cationic galliumoxo clusters in high-silica zeolites is mainly controlled by the favorable geometrical environment of the Ga3+ ions, whereas the effect of the direct interaction with the charge-compensating framework anionic sites is less important.

Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 cations are shown to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation.

Gallium-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for the aromatization of light alkanes.

Careful removal of the methyl ligands leads to isolated Ga+ ions. These ions dehydrogenate propane to propylene which is the first step in its aromatization.

Recent theoretical studies have clearly shown that these species cannot be responsible for stable catalytic activity.

The nature of the stationary point obtained was tested by analyzing the calculated harmonic normal modes.

As detailed periodic DFT calculations with the large ZSM-5 unit cell are prohibitive in terms of computer demand, we choose mordenite as a model for a high-silica zeolite.

The energy of the initial system with two Ga+ ions does not depend on the Al distribution in the zeolite.

The computations indicate that stabilization of the proposed binuclear galliumoxo cations in high-silica zeolites is possibly independent of the Al distribution.

Taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+ 2 sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity.

Initial CH bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic with a moderate activation barrier.

Subsequently, the grafted C2H 5 group decomposes to gas-phase ethylene and a hydride ion bound to Ga.

Closure of the catalytic cycle by H2 recombination from 5 is possible over the binuclear Ga2O2+ 2 site.

The difference lies in the decreased basicity of the bridging extraframework oxygen anion.

Such bridging oxygens are essential to close the catalytic cycle by hydrogen recombination.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, particularly gallium oxo clusters and gallium hydrides. The stability of these clusters is primarily determined by the favorable geometric environment of the Ga3+ ions, rather than direct interaction with the framework anions. Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 cations exhibit high reactivity for light alkane dehydrogenation, indicating their potential role as active sites in the catalyst. The presence of gallium oxo clusters suggests that gallium-containing high-silica zeolites, with a Ga content approaching the ion-exchange capacity, predominantly feature such clusters as the active species in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The structure-activity correlations in these catalysts highlight the importance of the geometric arrangement of gallium ions and the stability of the gallium oxo clusters for efficient alkane activation and conversion.

在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝配对密度影响活性镓物种（特别是镓氧簇和镓氢）的形成和性质。这些簇的稳定性主要由Ga3+离子的有利几何环境决定，而不是与框架阴离子的直接相互作用。额外框架上的环状Ga2O2+ 2阳离子显示出对轻烷烃脱氢的高度反应性，表明它们可能是催化剂中的活性位点。存在镓氧簇表明，富含镓的高硅沸石催化剂，其Ga含量接近交换容量，主要以这样的簇作为丙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点。这些催化剂的结构-活性相关性强调了镓离子几何排列的稳定性和镓氧簇对于有效烷基化和转化的重要性。
