The stability of binuclear cationic gallium-oxide clusters in high-silica zeolites is primarily influenced by the advantageous geometric surroundings of the Ga3+ ions, rather than the direct interaction with the negatively charged framework anionic sites. These clusters, particularly extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 ions, demonstrate activity in light alkane dehydrogenation processes.

高硅含量沸石中二核正电镓氧化物簇的稳定性主要由Ga3+离子的有利几何环境控制，而不是直接与框架阴离子位点的相互作用。特别是额外框架上的环状Ga2O2+ 2离子在轻烷烃脱氢反应中表现出活性。

The periodic DFT calculations revealed that the stability of binuclear gallium-oxide clusters in high-silica zeolites is largely determined by the favorable geometric environment of the Ga3+ ions, with the impact of direct interaction with compensating framework anionic sites being less significant. Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 ions were demonstrated to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The stability of binuclear gallium-oxide clusters in high-silica zeolites is predominantly governed by the beneficial geometric setting of the Ga3+ ions, with the role of the direct engagement with the anionic framework sites being less critical. Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 ions are identified as active components in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
