Periodic DFT calculations show that stability of binuclear cationic galliumoxo clusters in high-silica zeolites is mainly controlled by the favorable geometrical environment of the Ga3+ ions, whereas the effect of the direct interaction with the charge-compensating framework anionic sites is less important. Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 cations are shown to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation. 

In catalysis, the most stable sites often show significantly lower reactivity than lesser stable ones. To check whether this would also be the case for the Ga2O2 isomers, we calculated the energetics of the most important reaction steps (CH bond activation and H2 recombination) of catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over the most stable structure 3 (Scheme 1) and over mononuclear GaO+. For comparison the reaction energies for the respective elementary steps were computed for the charge-alternating structure 3. The calculated reaction (E) and activation energies (E) are summarized in Table 1.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the stability and reactivity of gallium oxo clusters. Higher ratios of Ga to Al and a higher Si/Al ratio promote the formation of extraframework gallium oxo clusters, which are more stable and thus more active in light alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The framework aluminum pair density impacts the coordination environment around gallium ions, which in turn affects the stability and reactivity of the gallium species. The structure-activity correlations reveal that the most stable gallium sites, characterized by a stable tetrahedral coordination environment, exhibit lower reactivity compared to less stable sites, which is crucial for the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架中铝原子对的密度影响Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种，包括镓氢化物的形成和性质。较高的Ga与Al比例和更高的Si/Al比促进额外框架镓氧簇的形成，这些簇更加稳定，因此在轻烷烃脱氢反应中更为活跃。框架中铝原子对的密度影响镓离子周围的配位环境，进而影响镓物种的稳定性和反应性。结构-活性相关性表明，最稳定的镓位点，特征为稳定的四面体配位环境，其反应性较低，这对于丙烷脱氢反应的效率至关重要。
