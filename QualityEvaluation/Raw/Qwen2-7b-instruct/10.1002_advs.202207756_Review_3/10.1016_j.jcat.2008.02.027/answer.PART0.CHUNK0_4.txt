Periodic DFT calculations show that stability of binuclear cationic galliumoxo clusters in high-silica zeolites is mainly controlled by the favorable geometrical environment of the Ga3+ ions, whereas the effect of the direct interaction with the charge-compensating framework anionic sites is less important. Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 cations are shown to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species by promoting the formation of stable binuclear galliumoxo clusters. These clusters are characterized by a favorable geometrical environment around the Ga3+ ions, which enhances their stability in high-silica zeolites. The direct interaction with the charge-compensating framework anionic sites plays a less significant role in stabilizing these clusters. Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+ 2 cations are particularly active in light alkane dehydrogenation processes.

在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，通过促进稳定双核镓氧化簇的形成。这些簇的特点是在Ga3+离子周围有良好的几何环境，这增强了高硅沸石中的稳定性。直接与补偿框架阴离子位点的相互作用在稳定这些簇的作用较小。额外的框架外环状Ga2O2+ 2阳离子特别适合轻烷烃脱氢反应。
