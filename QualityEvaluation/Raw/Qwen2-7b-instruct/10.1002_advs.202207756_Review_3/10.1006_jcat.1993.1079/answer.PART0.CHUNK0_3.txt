"Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
"Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions."
"Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
"These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5."
"Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions."
"This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."

The formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The reduced Ga species are present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, possibly as monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen under the high surface hydrogen fugacities developed during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. When samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, the reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3, indicating that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions. This study highlights the importance of in-situ techniques to understand the chemical form of catalytic sites, as pre- and post-reaction characterization alone may lead to misleading conclusions.

Ga改良的沸石催化剂中，活性镓物种及其氢化物的形成和性质受Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和框架铝对密度的影响。减少的Ga物种以高度分散的形式存在，没有Ga邻近原子，可能作为与沸石通道内的基本氧基协调的单体氢化物物种。这些氢化物物种在丙烷脱氢二聚化于H-ZSM5时，在高表面氢分压下释放分子氢。当样品在流动H2中冷却至室温时，减少的Ga物种重新氧化为Ga+3，表明仅在反应条件下存在活性的Ga形式。这项研究表明，原位技术对于理解催化位点的化学形式至关重要，因为仅通过前反应和后反应表征可能会导致误导性的结论。
