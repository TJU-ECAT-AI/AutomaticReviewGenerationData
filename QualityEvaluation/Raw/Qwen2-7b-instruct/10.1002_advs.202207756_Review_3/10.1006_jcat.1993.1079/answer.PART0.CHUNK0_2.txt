[1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
[2] "Specifically, they promote the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and thus inhibit undesired cracking reactions."
[3] "Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions."
[4] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
[5] "These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5."
[6] "Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions."
[7] "This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. The reduced Ga species are present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, likely as monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to the high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization. The active forms of Ga exist only under reaction conditions, as indicated by the reoxidation of reduced Ga species to Ga+3 upon cooling to room temperature in flowing H2. These findings highlight the importance of in-situ techniques in understanding the chemical form of catalytic sites and avoiding misleading conclusions based solely on pre- and post-reaction characterization.

在Ga修饰的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率以及框架铝对密度影响了活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。还原态的Ga存在于高度分散的形式中，没有Ga邻近原子，可能以单体氢化物物种协调到沸石通道中的基本氧原子。这些氢化物物种通过在丙烷脱氢环二聚化过程中开发的高表面氢分压释放分子氢。在H-ZSM5上进行反应时，还原态Ga物种在流动H2中冷却至室温时重新氧化为Ga+3，这表明只有在反应条件下存在活性的Ga形式。这些发现强调了原位技术在理解催化位点的化学形式中的重要性，并避免仅基于反应前和后表征得出误导性结论。
