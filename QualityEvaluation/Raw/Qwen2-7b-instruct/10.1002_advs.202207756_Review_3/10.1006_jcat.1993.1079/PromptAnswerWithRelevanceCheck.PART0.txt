How do the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and what do these relationships reveal about the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions?

The formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. These factors determine the structure of the catalyst, which in turn affects the chemical state of gallium. During the conversion of alkanes to aromatics, gallium species catalyze the rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps. Initially, Ga+3 species are present in fresh catalysts, which reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. The reduced Ga is present in a highly dispersed form, possibly as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Active forms of gallium exist only at reaction conditions, as the reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2.

在Ga修饰的沸石催化剂中，活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质受Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度的影响。这些因素决定了催化剂的结构，进而影响镓的化学状态。在将烷烃转化为芳香族化合物的过程中，镓物种催化速率决定性的脱氢步骤。在新鲜催化剂中，初始存在Ga+3物种，在770 K以下的温度下，通过氢预处理或丙烷反应期间进行还原。还原的Ga以高度分散的形式存在，可能作为与沸石通道内的基本氧原子配位的单体氢化物物种。这些氢化物物种由于在H-ZSM5上的丙烷脱氢环二聚化过程中表面氢分压的升高而释放分子氢。只有在反应条件下，活性形式的镓才存在，因为还原的Ga物种在流动H2中冷却至室温时重新氧化为Ga+3。

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. The reduced Ga species are present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, likely as monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to the high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization. The active forms of Ga exist only under reaction conditions, as indicated by the reoxidation of reduced Ga species to Ga+3 upon cooling to room temperature in flowing H2. These findings highlight the importance of in-situ techniques in understanding the chemical form of catalytic sites and avoiding misleading conclusions based solely on pre- and post-reaction characterization.

在Ga修饰的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率以及框架铝对密度影响了活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质。还原态的Ga存在于高度分散的形式中，没有Ga邻近原子，可能以单体氢化物物种协调到沸石通道中的基本氧原子。这些氢化物物种通过在丙烷脱氢环二聚化过程中开发的高表面氢分压释放分子氢。在H-ZSM5上进行反应时，还原态Ga物种在流动H2中冷却至室温时重新氧化为Ga+3，这表明只有在反应条件下存在活性的Ga形式。这些发现强调了原位技术在理解催化位点的化学形式中的重要性，并避免仅基于反应前和后表征得出误导性结论。

The reduced Ga species are present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, possibly as monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen under the high surface hydrogen fugacities developed during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. When samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, the reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3, indicating that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions. This study highlights the importance of in-situ techniques to understand the chemical form of catalytic sites, as pre- and post-reaction characterization alone may lead to misleading conclusions.
