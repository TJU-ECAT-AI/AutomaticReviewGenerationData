The synthesis of the binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides involved an alcoholic co-precipitation method. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using a Tristar II 3020 apparatus. X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted on a PANalytical Xpert Pro X-ray diffractometer. The reducibility of the catalysts was assessed through H2 temperature-programmed reduction. Surface acidity was determined using temperature-programmed desorption of NH3. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Thermo Nicolet Almega XR Dispersive Raman Spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis was executed using a Netzsch STA 409 TGA-DSC. XPS analysis utilized a Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source.
