The synthesis of binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides was achieved through an alcoholic co-precipitation method. The reducibility of catalysts was evaluated using H2 temperature-programmed reduction in a flow-type fixed bed reactor. Surface acidity was determined through temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 at ambient pressure. Raman spectroscopy utilized a Thermo Nicolet Almega XR Dispersive Raman Spectrometer with confocal optics. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted using Netzsch STA 409 TGA-DSC. XPS analysis employed a Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source.
