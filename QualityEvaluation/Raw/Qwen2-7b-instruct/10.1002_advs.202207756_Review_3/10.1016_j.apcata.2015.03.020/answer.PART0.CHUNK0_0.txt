[1] "A series of binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides was synthesized by an alcoholic co-precipitation method [49]."
[2] "In a typical synthesis, specific amounts of the indium and gallium precursors (nitrate hydrate, SigmaAldrich, 99.9%) at different molar ratios were dissolved in ethanol (Alfa-Aesar, 95%)."
[3] "Then, a mixture containing concentrated aqueous ammonia (SigmaAldrich, 28 wt%) and ethanol (1:1 in volume) was added dropwise to the precursor solution until no further precipitation occurred (pH 8.5)."
[4] "After aging for 1 h while stirring at 250 rpm at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 6000 rpm."
[5] "Then the recovered, precipitated gel was dried at 70°C overnight."

The binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides were synthesized through an alcoholic coprecipitation method. Precursors of indium nitrate hydrate and gallium nitrate were dissolved in ethanol at varying molar ratios. Aqueous ammonia was added to the solution until no further precipitation occurred. The mixture was aged, centrifuged, dried, and finally calcined in air at 600°C for 6 hours.

通过醇基共沉淀法合成了二元In2O3Ga2O3混合氧化物。将不同摩尔比的铟硝酸盐水合物和镓硝酸盐溶解在乙醇中。向溶液中加入浓氨水，直到不再有进一步的沉淀。混合物老化、离心、干燥，并最终在600°C下空气煅烧6小时。

The provided literature does not contain information related to the questions about the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influencing the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and their relationship to structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, I am unable to answer these questions based on the given document.
