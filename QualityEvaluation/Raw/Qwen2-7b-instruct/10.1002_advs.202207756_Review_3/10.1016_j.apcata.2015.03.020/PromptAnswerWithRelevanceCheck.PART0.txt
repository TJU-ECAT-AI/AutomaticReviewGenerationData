How do the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and what do these relationships reveal about the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions?

[1] "A series of binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides was synthesized by an alcoholic co-precipitation method [49]."
[2] "In a typical synthesis, specific amounts of the indium and gallium precursors (nitrate hydrate, SigmaAldrich, 99.9%) at different molar ratios were dissolved in ethanol (Alfa-Aesar, 95%)."
[3] "Then, a mixture containing concentrated aqueous ammonia (SigmaAldrich, 28 wt%) and ethanol (1:1 in volume) was added dropwise to the precursor solution until no further precipitation occurred (pH 8.5)."
[4] "After aging for 1 h while stirring at 250 rpm at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 6000 rpm."
[5] "Then the recovered, precipitated gel was dried at 70°C overnight."
[6] "Finally, the obtained sample was calcined in air at 600 C for 6 h."

The binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides were synthesized through an alcoholic coprecipitation method. Precursors of indium nitrate hydrate and gallium nitrate were dissolved in ethanol at varying molar ratios. Aqueous ammonia was added to the solution until no further precipitation occurred. The mixture was aged, centrifuged, dried, and finally calcined in air at 600°C for 6 hours.
