[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."
[2] "Zn species increase the rate of propane dehydrogenation (r1) (Fig. 2); therefore, they must also catalyze the reverse reaction: propene hydrogenation (r1)."
[3] "Relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and conversion to other products (r2) (Scheme 2) can be measured from the rate of isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene and from the isotopic content of the other reaction products."
[4] "Products of propane-2-13C reactions on Zn/H-ZSM5 suggest that alkenes exit from these oligomerization/β-scission cycles more rapidly than on H-ZSM5."
[5] "Propane conversion turnover rates and aromatic selectivities decrease as H2 pressure increases (0
26.6kPaH2), because adsorption desorptions sites provided by Zn cations allow gas phase hydrogen pressures to influence surface hydrogen concentrations and the rate of hydrogenation dehydrogenation steps."

1.Modifications of pentasil zeolites with zinc (Zn) ions enhance the catalytic activity for ethane, propane, and propene aromatization reactions, increasing the turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates.

2.Zinc ions not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane (r1), but also facilitate the reverse reaction, propene hydrogenation.

3.The relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and conversion to other products (r2) can be determined by measuring the isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene, along with the isotopic composition of the resulting products.

4.Products formed from propane-2-13C reactions on zeolites modified with zinc show that alkenes leave the oligomerization/β-scission cycles more quickly compared to reactions on unmodified zeolites.

5.Increasing the pressure of hydrogen gas (H2) in the atmosphere reduces the rates of propane conversion and aromatic product selectivity. This happens because the zinc (Zn) ions on the catalyst surface enable hydrogen gas to dissociatively adsorb, influencing the surface hydrogen concentration and the rates of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

1.对五元环沸石催化剂进行锌（Zn）离子交换后，乙烷、丙烷和丙烯的芳构化反应的转化率提高，增加了转化速率、芳香族产物的时空产率以及氢气的排放速率。

2.锌离子不仅催化丙烷的脱氢反应（r1），还催化丙烯的氢化反应。

3.可以通过测量丙烷-2-13C与未标记丙烯之间的同位素混合以及产物的同位素组成来确定丙烯氢化反应（r1）和转化为其他产物（r2）的相对速率。

4.从添加了锌的沸石催化剂上形成的丙烷-2-13C反应产物显示，烯烃在寡聚化/β-裂解循环中更快地离开，与未改性的沸石相比。

5.增加氢气（H2）在大气中的压力会降低丙烷的转化率和芳香族产物的选择性。这是因为催化剂表面的锌离子允许氢气以离解吸附的方式吸附，影响表面氢浓度以及氢化和脱氢反应的速率。
