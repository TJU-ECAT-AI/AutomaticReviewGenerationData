[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields,and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane,and propene aromatization."
[2] "Zn cations not only cata- lyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conver- sion rates."
[3] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromati- zation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
[4] "Hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 cata- lysts."

1. Modifying pentasil zeolites with zinc ions enhances the turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during the aromatization of ethane, propane, and propene.
2. Zinc ions not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes (reaction r1), but also accelerate the conversion of alkenes.
3. Zinc ions increase the rates of alkane aromatization by boosting the rate of recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms produced in C-H bond activation steps.
4. Hydrogen adsorption-desorption processes remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on catalysts containing zinc ions.

1. 通过将锌离子置换到五元硅沸石催化剂中，可以提高乙烷、丙烷和丙烯芳构化过程中的转化率、芳香族产物形成速率以及氢气的消耗速率。
2. 锌离子不仅催化烷烃的脱氢反应（反应r1），还能促进烯烃的转化。
3. 锌离子通过加速C-H键激活步骤中生成的氢原子的重组脱附，来提高烷烃的芳构化速率。
4. 即使在含有锌离子的催化剂上，氢吸附-脱附过程仍保持不可逆（决定性）的特性。
