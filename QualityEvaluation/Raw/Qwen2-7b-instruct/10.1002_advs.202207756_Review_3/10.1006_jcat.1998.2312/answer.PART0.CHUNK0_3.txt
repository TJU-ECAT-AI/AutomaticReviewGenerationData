[1] "Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesir- able products."
[2] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles,leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aro- matic products."
[3] "Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation. When Zn is present, k3 becomes the dominant term in the denominator and β-scission rates decrease when Zn is added."
[4] "The presence of Zn increases the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into the products of C3H8/D2 reactions."
[5] "The requirement of Bronsted acid sites for C3H8/C3D8 cross-exchange is evident from the data in Table 4."

1. Adding Ga, Zn, and Pt species to H-ZSM5 catalysts enhances the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while suppressing β-scission side reactions that produce undesirable products.
2. Zn ions reduce β-scission rates and the duration of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to increased synthesis rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.
3. The introduction of Zn increases the rate of dehydrogenation reactions. With Zn present, the rate constant k3 becomes the primary factor in the denominator, causing β-scission rates to decline when Zn is added.
4. Incorporating Zn cations accelerates the isotopic equilibration of H2/D2 mixtures and the incorporation of deuterium into the products derived from C3H8/D2 reactions.
5. The necessity of Bronsted acid sites for the cross-exchange of C3H8/C3D8 mixtures is demonstrated by the data presented in Table 4.

1. 向H-ZSM5催化剂中添加Ga、Zn和Pt物种可以提高芳构化反应的速率和选择性，同时抑制导致不良产物的β裂解副反应。
2. Zn离子降低了β裂解速率和烯烃在寡聚化/β裂解循环中的停留时间，导致C6-C8芳烃产品的合成速率和选择性的增加。
3. 引入Zn提高了脱氢反应的速率。当Zn存在时，速率常数k3成为分母的主要因素，导致添加Zn时β裂解速率下降。
4. 将Zn离子引入可以加速H2/D2混合物的同位素平衡和从C3H8/D2反应物获得的产品中的氘原子的掺入。
5. 表4中的数据证明了酸性Bronsted位点对于C3H8/C3D8混合物的交叉交换的必要性。
