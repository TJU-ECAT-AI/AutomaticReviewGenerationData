[1] "Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesir- able products."
[2] "In this study, we present mechanistic evidence for bifunctional pathways in the conversion of ethane and propane to aromatics on H-ZSM5 modified by Zn cations."
[3] "Zn species increase the rate of propane dehydrogenation (r1); therefore, they must also catalyze the reverse reaction: propene hydrogenation (r1)."
[4] "The data in Fig. 1 show that hydrogen desorption site-yields increase with increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5."
[5] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."

1. The addition of Ga, Zn, and Pt species into H-ZSM5 enhances the speed and efficiency of aromatic production reactions while reducing the occurrence of unwanted β-scission side reactions.
2. This research provides evidence for dual-function pathways involved in the transformation of ethane and propane into aromatics on H-ZSM5 catalysts modified with Zn ions.
3. Zn ions elevate the rate of propane dehydrogenation and consequently also catalyze the reverse process, propene hydrogenation.
4. As depicted in Figure 1, the yield of hydrogen desorption increases with the increment of Zn content in H-ZSM5.
5. The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is notably higher on catalysts containing Zn ions compared to H-ZSM5, despite the enhancement in dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1) due to Zn cations.

1. 将Ga、Zn和Pt物种添加到H-ZSM5中，可以提高芳香化反应的速度和选择性，并抑制导致不良产物的β-裂解副反应。
2. 本研究提供了在H-ZSM5催化剂上通过Zn离子改性的条件下，乙烷和丙烷转化为芳香物的双功能途径的证据。
3. Zn离子不仅加速了丙烷的脱氢作用，还催化了反向过程，即丙烯的氢化作用。
4. 如图1所示，随着H-ZSM5中Zn含量的增加，氢脱附的产率也有所提升。
5. 含有Zn离子的催化剂中，丙烯芳香化（r2）与丙烯氢化（r1）速率的比值明显高于仅含H-ZSM5的情况，尽管由于Zn离子的存在，脱氢氢化步骤（r1，r1）的速率得到了增强。
