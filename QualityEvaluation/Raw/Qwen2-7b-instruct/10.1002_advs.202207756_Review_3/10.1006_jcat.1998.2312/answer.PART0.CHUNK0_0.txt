1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the density and distribution of acid sites in the zeolite structure. Higher Ga/Al ratios lead to more gallium cations, which can form hydride complexes, enhancing dehydrogenation activity. The Si/Al ratio impacts the framework structure, influencing the accessibility of acid sites and the stability of gallium species. Framework aluminum pair density affects the zeolite's pore size and acidity, impacting the reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The addition of Zn cations to H-ZSM5 catalysts increases the rate and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions compared to H-ZSM5 alone. This improvement is due to Zn cations decreasing β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products.

3. Propane conversion rates on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 at 773 K are significantly higher on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, indicating enhanced dehydrogenation and aromatization activities.

4. Ethane conversion rates are lower than propane conversion rates on both H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, highlighting the more efficient conversion of propane to aromatics under the studied conditions.

5. The addition of Zn species to H-ZSM5 catalysts leads to an increase in propene conversion turnover rates, aromatics site-time yields, hydrogen desorption turnovers, aromatics selectivity, and hydrogen selectivity, demonstrating improved propane conversion efficiency.

6. The (r2/r1) ratios on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts are higher than on H-ZSM5, reflecting faster initial propane dehydrogenation steps catalyzed by Zn cations, which also increase the rate of subsequent reactions of propene to aromatics.

7. Products of propane-2-13C reactions on Zn/H-ZSM5 suggest that alkenes exit from these oligomerization/β-scission cycles more rapidly than on H-ZSM5, indicating a faster conversion pathway involving Zn cations.

8. (Toluene/benzene) ratios are higher on H-ZSM5 than on Zn-containing catalysts, suggesting that the presence of Zn cations accelerates the conversion of alkenes to aromatics.

9. Comparison of the rates of propane cross exchange and propane chemical conversion on H-ZSM5 reveals that cross exchange occurs much faster than chemical conversion, providing insights into the reaction mechanisms.

10. The rate of hydrogen recombinative desorption steps during propane conversion can be measured from the deuterium content in reaction products and in unre-acted propane, offering a method to assess the reversibility of hydrogen adsorption and desorption processes.

11. The distribution of D-atom isotopomers within each product formed on H-ZSM5 follows a binomial distribution, indicating the complex pathways of hydrogen incorporation and desorption in the zeolite structure.

12. The rate of incorporation of D atoms into unreacted propane provides an independent measure of the D content in the surface pool, highlighting the importance of surface chemistry in propane conversion.

13. The presence of Zn cations enhances the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into products, suggesting improved communication between gas phase and surface hydrogen pools.

14. Propane aromatization rates and selectivities are independent of H2 pressure on H-ZSM5, implying that the catalyst's structure is not significantly affected by external hydrogen supply.

15. As Zn cations increase the rate (and reversibility) of adsorption-desorption steps, surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates become more reflective of the rates of hydrogen formation in C-H bond activation steps and gas phase hydrogen supply.
