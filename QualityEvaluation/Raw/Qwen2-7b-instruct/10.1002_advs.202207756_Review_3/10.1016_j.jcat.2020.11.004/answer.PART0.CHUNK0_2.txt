The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly affect the formation and characteristics of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. Gallium plus hydrogen (Ga+H+) paired sites exhibit higher activity compared to isolated Ga+ sites and the base H-ZSM-5 catalyst, as evidenced by reactivity tests, quantitative pulse reactions, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The nature of Ga species, including the formation of Ga+H+ pairs versus isolated Ga+, is influenced by the Al density within the zeolite framework. This leads to differences in the catalytic properties of Ga+H+ pairs and isolated Ga+ sites, particularly in terms of their reactivity with water. The structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are thus determined by the specific parameters of the Ga-modified zeolite catalysts.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和骨架铝配对密度在改性沸石催化剂中显著影响活性镓物种的形成和特性，尤其是镓氢（Ga+H+）物种。Ga+H+配对位点的活性高于孤立的Ga+位点和基础H-ZSM-5催化剂，这通过反应活性测试、定量脉冲反应和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算得到证实。Ga物种的性质，包括Ga+H+对的形成与孤立Ga+位点的形成之间的差异，受沸石框架中Al密度的影响。这导致Ga+H+对和孤立Ga+位点的催化性质不同，特别是它们与水的反应性。因此，丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性由改性沸石催化剂的具体参数决定。
