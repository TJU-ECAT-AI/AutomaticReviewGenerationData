[1] "Upon reduction with H2 at 550 C, Ga species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with BAS to form Ga+. Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios."
[2] "A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga loadings due to the scarcity of BAS."
[3] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites, which provides the first direct experimental evidence of inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species."
[4] "This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water."
[5] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in the following ways:

1. Gallium species, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio and Si/Al ratio. At low Si/Al ratios, gallium forms Ga+H+ pair sites, which can form gallium hydrides. At high Si/Al ratios, mainly isolated Ga+ species are produced, which cannot form gallium hydrides.

2. The relationship between the consumption of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) and gallium loading shows that at low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, there is a one-to-one correspondence. However, at higher Ga loadings, the exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult due to the scarcity of BAS.

3. Gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not on isolated Ga+ sites. This provides experimental evidence of the inhomogeneity of exchanged gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5.

4. Gallium+H+ pair sites do not react with water at 150°C, whereas isolated Ga+ sites can be oxidized to form GaOOH. This indicates different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites.

5. The different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites upon reaction with hydrogen at 550°C and water at 150°C suggest they might have different catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和框架铝配对密度影响活性镓物种的形成和性质如下：

1. 镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比例和Si/Al比例的影响。在低Si/Al比例下，镓形成Ga+H+配对位点，可以形成镓氢化物。在高Si/Al比例下，主要产生孤立的Ga+物种，不能形成镓氢化物。

2. 消耗Brnsted酸位点（BAS）与镓负载之间的关系显示，在低Si/Al和Ga/Al比例下，存在一对一对应关系。然而，在更高的Ga负载下，由于BAS的稀缺性，与BAS的交换变得越来越困难。

3. 只能在Ga+H+配对位点上形成镓氢化物，而不能在孤立的Ga+位点上形成。这提供了在Ga/H-ZSM-5中交换的镓物种异质性的实验证据。

4. Ga+H+配对位点在150°C时不会与水反应，而孤立的Ga+位点可以被氧化形成GaOOH。这表明Ga+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点具有不同的性质。

5. Ga+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点在550°C的氢气反应和150°C的水反应后表现出不同的性质，暗示它们可能在丙烷脱氢反应中有不同的催化性质。
