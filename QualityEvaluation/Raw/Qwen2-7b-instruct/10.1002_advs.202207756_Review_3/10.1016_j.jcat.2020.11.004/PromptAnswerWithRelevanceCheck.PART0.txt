[1] "Upon reduction with H2 at 550 C, Ga species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with BAS to form Ga+. Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios."
[2] "A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga loadings due to the scarcity of BAS."
[3] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites, which provides the first direct experimental evidence of inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species."
[4] "This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water."
[5] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in the following ways:

1. Gallium species, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio and Si/Al ratio. At low Si/Al ratios, gallium forms Ga+H+ pair sites, which can form gallium hydrides. At high Si/Al ratios, mainly isolated Ga+ species are produced, which cannot form gallium hydrides.

2. The relationship between the consumption of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) and gallium loading shows that at low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, there is a one-to-one correspondence. However, at higher Ga loadings, the exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult due to the scarcity of BAS.

3. Gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not on isolated Ga+ sites. This provides experimental evidence of the inhomogeneity of exchanged gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5.

4. Gallium+H+ pair sites do not react with water at 150°C, whereas isolated Ga+ sites can be oxidized to form GaOOH. This indicates different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites.

5. The different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites upon reaction with hydrogen at 550°C and water at 150°C suggest they might have different catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和框架铝配对密度影响活性镓物种的形成和性质如下：

1. 镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比例和Si/Al比例的影响。在低Si/Al比例下，镓形成Ga+H+配对位点，可以形成镓氢化物。在高Si/Al比例下，主要产生孤立的Ga+物种，不能形成镓氢化物。

2. 消耗Brnsted酸位点（BAS）与镓负载之间的关系显示，在低Si/Al和Ga/Al比例下，存在一对一对应关系。然而，在更高的Ga负载下，由于BAS的稀缺性，与BAS的交换变得越来越困难。

3. 只能在Ga+H+配对位点上形成镓氢化物，而不能在孤立的Ga+位点上形成。这提供了在Ga/H-ZSM-5中交换的镓物种异质性的实验证据。

4. Ga+H+配对位点在150°C时不会与水反应，而孤立的Ga+位点可以被氧化形成GaOOH。这表明Ga+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点具有不同的性质。

5. Ga+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点在550°C的氢气反应和150°C的水反应后表现出不同的性质，暗示它们可能在丙烷脱氢反应中有不同的催化性质。

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts affect the formation and nature of gallium species, including gallium hydrides. At lower Si/Al ratios, gallium tends to form Ga+H+ pair sites, whereas at higher Si/Al ratios, mainly isolated Ga+ species are produced. This reveals structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 are influenced by the reduction process with hydrogen, leading to migration of gallium species into zeolite micropores. The interaction with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) results in gallium substitution, forming gallium plus (Ga+) species. The preference for single proton exchange in paired BAS sites versus isolated BAS sites creates inhomogeneity in gallium species.

3. Gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not isolated Ga+ sites, providing evidence for the distinct nature of exchanged gallium species. This is supported by observations using water as a probe molecule, which shows that only isolated Ga+ species react with water at 150°C to form gallium oxide hydroxide (GaOOH).

4. The drastic differences in properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites upon reaction with hydrogen at 550°C and water at 150°C suggest potential differences in their catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This requires further investigation.

1. 在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对簇密度影响了镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物。在较低的Si/Al比率下，镓倾向于形成Ga+H+配对位点，而在较高的Si/Al比率下，主要生成孤立的Ga+物种。这揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构活性相关性。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5中的镓物种受到氢还原过程的影响，导致镓物种迁移到沸石微孔中。与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的相互作用导致镓取代，形成镓加（Ga+）物种。单个质子交换偏好在配对BAS位点而非孤立BAS位点上形成，表明交换的镓物种存在异质性。

3. 镓氢化物只能在Ga+H+配对位点形成，而不是孤立的Ga+位点，提供了不同交换的镓物种的证据。使用水作为探针分子进行观察，显示只有孤立的Ga+物种在150°C时与水反应形成镓氧化羟基（GaOOH）。

4. 镓+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点在550°C氢气反应和150°C水反应时表现出截然不同的特性，这暗示了它们在丙烷脱氢反应中的潜在催化性质差异。这需要进一步研究。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly affect the formation and characteristics of active gallium species, particularly gallium hydrides. Gallium plus hydrogen (Ga+H+) paired sites exhibit higher activity compared to isolated Ga+ sites and the base H-ZSM-5 catalyst, as evidenced by reactivity tests, quantitative pulse reactions, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The nature of Ga species, including the formation of Ga+H+ pairs versus isolated Ga+, is influenced by the Al density within the zeolite framework. This leads to differences in the catalytic properties of Ga+H+ pairs and isolated Ga+ sites, particularly in terms of their reactivity with water. The structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are thus determined by the specific parameters of the Ga-modified zeolite catalysts.

Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和骨架铝配对密度在改性沸石催化剂中显著影响活性镓物种的形成和特性，尤其是镓氢（Ga+H+）物种。Ga+H+配对位点的活性高于孤立的Ga+位点和基础H-ZSM-5催化剂，这通过反应活性测试、定量脉冲反应和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算得到证实。Ga物种的性质，包括Ga+H+对的形成与孤立Ga+位点的形成之间的差异，受沸石框架中Al密度的影响。这导致Ga+H+对和孤立Ga+位点的催化性质不同，特别是它们与水的反应性。因此，丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性由改性沸石催化剂的具体参数决定。

<p>Quantitative FTIR experiments with pyridine show that not all BAS can be exchanged by Ga species even at Ga/Al ratios up to 1.7 during the reduction treatment. Although results in Fig. 2 unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of the replacement of BAS with Ga species during the reduction treatment, it could be deceiving when used as the basis for quantitative analysis. This is because the BAS OH band of zeolite samples is easily obscured by the background at low densities [38]. To determine the density of the BAS left on Ga/H-ZSM-5 after reduction, pyridine was intro- duced to reduced samples at 150 C.</p>

2. Quantitative FTIR experiments using pyridine revealed that not all Brnsted acid sites (BAS) can be completely replaced by gallium species, even at high gallium to aluminum (Ga/Al) ratios up to 1.7 during the reduction process. The straightforward interpretation of the results presented in Figure 2, which clearly shows the replacement of BAS with Ga species during reduction, might be misleading for quantitative analysis. This is due to the BAS OH band in zeolite samples being easily masked by background noise at low densities [38]. To ascertain the BAS density remaining on Ga/H-ZSM-5 after reduction, pyridine was introduced to the reduced samples at 150 C.

2. 使用吡啶进行的定量FTIR实验表明，即使在高达1.7的镓到铝（Ga/Al）比值的情况下，也不一定能完全用镓物种替换掉所有Brnsted酸位点（BAS）。尽管图2中的结果明确显示了在减压过程中BAS被Ga物种取代的过程，但将其作为定量分析的基础可能会误导。这是因为低密度下的BAS OH带容易被背景噪音掩盖[38]。为了确定在减压后留在Ga/H-ZSM-5上的BAS密度，向减压样品引入吡啶在150 C下。

3. Carrying out the pyridine experiments on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples without exposure to air or water is crucial for obtaining accurate BAS densities on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. BAS may reappear on the catalyst upon re-oxidation (Fig. S3(v)), so methods such as NH3-TPD performed ex-situ are not likely to yield relevant results for reduced catalysts [11] without appropriate pretreatment of the catalyst.

3. 对减压后的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品进行无空气或水暴露的吡啶实验对于获得减压后Ga/H-ZSM-5的可靠BAS密度至关重要。催化剂重新氧化（Fig. S3(v)）后，BAS可能重新出现，因此如NH3-TPD这样的离线方法不大可能产生与减压催化剂相关的相关结果[11]，除非对催化剂进行适当的预处理。

<p>Water interacts extensively with Ga+ and GaHx species leading to distinct spectral features, and thus is an excellent probe molecule of Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. Several reports have mentioned that reduced Ga+ is sensitive to trace amounts of water [26,27], leading to its oxidation. Introducing water vapor to reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 550 C leads to the appearance of bands at 3591 and 3662 cm1, attributable to recovered BAS and Ga(OH)x, respectively [26]. This suggests that water is able to oxidize Ga+ at this condition to reform BAS and Ga(OH)x (Scheme 2).</p>

<p>Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. The hypothesis that the exchanged Ga species exist in two distinct environments (isolated and paired with a neighboring proton), together with the spectral features observed upon water introduction (Figs. 7 and 8), lead to the prediction that water does not react with GaHx at 150 C. The intense band corresponding to GaOOH in most cases overwhelms the GaHx features, preventing the unambiguous identification of GaHx bands after water introduction. H-D exchange experiments were con- ducted to probe the reactivity of GaHx with water.</p>

5. Isotope labeling experiments confirm that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. The assumption that the exchanged Ga species exist in two separate environments (isolated and paired with a neighboring proton), along with the spectral patterns observed upon water introduction (Figs. 7 and 8), suggests that water does not interact with GaHx at 150 C. In most instances, the prominent band indicative of GaOOH obscures the GaHx features, hindering the clear identification of GaHx bands post-water introduction. H-D exchange experiments were carried out to assess the reactivity of GaHx with water.

<p>The dependence of the formation and relative abundance of the gallium hydride species formed upon reduction on the Ga/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios provides another dimension to differentiate different Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride (GaH, 2059 cm1) and Ga dihydride (GaH2, 2041 cm1) after reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 using DRIFTS.</p>
<p>The bands for these Ga- H stretching modes generally blueshift as Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1) cools down under vacuum (Fig. S8), which explains the slight shifts of the hydride bands reported in this work compared to those by Hensen and coworkers [27,28].</p>
<p>In-situ FTIR spectroscopy is employed to monitor the formation of Ga hydride species at 550 C on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with multiple Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios.

<p>Pyridine FTIR spectra show that consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction does not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 (Fig. 3a and 4). These diverging trends for the Ga hydride formation and the BAS consumption indicate that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is clear evidence of the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species, in addition to the those remaining on the external surface of zeolite crystals (especially at higher Ga loadings) [11].</p>
<p>Water interacts extensively with Ga+ and GaHx species leading to distinct spectral features, and thus is an excellent probe molecule of Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5.

<p>Introduction of water to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 C leads to the production of H2, in agreement with water acting as an oxidant (Fig. S13). Based on literature precedents and the water introduction reaction results, we assign the band at 2052 cm1 to GaOOH.</p>

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. Gallium species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form gallium ions (Ga+). The exchange preference is towards single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ ions are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio. Gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not isolated Ga+ sites, providing evidence of the heterogeneity of exchanged gallium species.

2. The structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are revealed through the relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. Gallium species formed after reduction with hydrogen at 550°C exhibit different properties when exposed to water at 150°C. Gallium ions (Ga+) preferentially exchange with single protons in paired BAS sites, resulting in the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios.

1. 在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝配对密度会影响活性镓物种的形成和性质。位于表面的镓物种迁移到沸石微孔中并与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）交换形成镓离子（Ga+）。在低Si/Al比样品中，单个氢键在配对BAS位点上更倾向于与Ga+交换。主要在高Si/Al比样品中产生孤立的Ga+离子。仅在Ga+H+配对位点上可以形成镓氢化物，而不是孤立的Ga+位点，这提供了交换镓物种异质性的证据。

2. 烯烃脱氢反应的结构-活性相关性通过以下关系揭示：Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝配对密度。在550°C下还原氢后形成的镓物种在150°C下暴露于水时表现出不同的性质。在低Si/Al比样品中，Ga+优先与配对BAS位点上的单个氢键交换，形成Ga+H+配对位点。在高Si/Al比样品中主要产生孤立的Ga+离子。仅在Ga+H+配对位点上可以形成镓氢化物，而不是孤立的Ga+位点，这提供了交换镓物种异质性的证据。

3. 镓氢化物仅能在Ga+H+配对位点上形成，而不是孤立的Ga+位点。这表明在550°C下还原氢后形成的镓物种在150°C下暴露于水中时表现出不同的性质。Ga+优先与低Si/Al比样品中的单个氢键在配对BAS位点上交换，形成Ga+H+配对位点。在高Si/Al比样品中主要产生孤立的Ga+离子。仅在Ga+H+配对位点上可以形成镓氢化物，而不是孤立的Ga+位点，这提供了交换镓物种异质性的证据。
