<p>These observations agree with previous XANES results showing the formation of GaOx oligomers at Ga/Al > 0.3 [11]. The highest percentage of BAS consumption in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/Al ratios is similar (80%), suggesting a thermodynamic barrier rather than a purely diffusional one to achieve complete BAS replacement.</p>
<p>Conducting the pyridine experiments on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples without air or water exposure is key to obtaining reliable BAS densities on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5,as BAS can reappear upon catalyst re-oxidation (Fig. S3(v)).</p>
<p>When pyridine was introduced to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), the band corresponding to pyridine adsorbed on the LAS (1455 cm1) increases in intensity with increasing Ga/Al ratio.</p>
<p>The dependence of the formation and relative abundance of the gallium hydride species formed upon reduction on the Ga/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios provides another dimension to differentiate different Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.</p>
<p>No detectable spectral feature is observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with the Ga/Al ratio up to 1.3 (Ga wt% up to 3.68%).</p>
<p>The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e., Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS (Scheme 1).</p>
<p>Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C.</p>

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts affect the formation and nature of gallium species, including gallium hydrides. At lower Si/Al ratios, gallium tends to form Ga+H+ pair sites, whereas at higher Si/Al ratios, mainly isolated Ga+ species are produced. This reveals structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 are influenced by the reduction process with hydrogen, leading to migration of gallium species into zeolite micropores. The interaction with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) results in gallium substitution, forming gallium plus (Ga+) species. The preference for single proton exchange in paired BAS sites versus isolated BAS sites creates inhomogeneity in gallium species.

3. Gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not isolated Ga+ sites, providing evidence for the distinct nature of exchanged gallium species. This is supported by observations using water as a probe molecule, which shows that only isolated Ga+ species react with water at 150°C to form gallium oxide hydroxide (GaOOH).

4. The drastic differences in properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites upon reaction with hydrogen at 550°C and water at 150°C suggest potential differences in their catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This requires further investigation.

1. 在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对簇密度影响了镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物。在较低的Si/Al比率下，镓倾向于形成Ga+H+配对位点，而在较高的Si/Al比率下，主要生成孤立的Ga+物种。这揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构活性相关性。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5中的镓物种受到氢还原过程的影响，导致镓物种迁移到沸石微孔中。与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的相互作用导致镓取代，形成镓加（Ga+）物种。单个质子交换偏好在配对BAS位点而非孤立BAS位点上形成，表明交换的镓物种存在异质性。

3. 镓氢化物只能在Ga+H+配对位点形成，而不是孤立的Ga+位点，提供了不同交换的镓物种的证据。使用水作为探针分子进行观察，显示只有孤立的Ga+物种在150°C时与水反应形成镓氧化羟基（GaOOH）。

4. 镓+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点在550°C氢气反应和150°C水反应时表现出截然不同的特性，这暗示了它们在丙烷脱氢反应中的潜在催化性质差异。这需要进一步研究。
