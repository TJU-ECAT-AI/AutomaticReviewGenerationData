<p>Quantitative FTIR experiments with pyridine show that not all BAS can be exchanged by Ga species even at Ga/Al ratios up to 1.7 during the reduction treatment. Although results in Fig. 2 unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of the replacement of BAS with Ga species during the reduction treatment, it could be deceiving when used as the basis for quantitative analysis. This is because the BAS OH band of zeolite samples is easily obscured by the background at low densities [38]. To determine the density of the BAS left on Ga/H-ZSM-5 after reduction, pyridine was introduced to reduced samples at 150 C.</p>
<p>Conducting the pyridine experiments on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples without air or water exposure is key to obtaining reliable BAS densities on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, as BAS can reappear upon catalyst re-oxidation (Fig. S3(v)). Thus, ex-situ methods such as NH3-TPD are unlikely to produce results relevant to reduced catalysts [11] unless proper catalyst pretreatment is included.</p>
<p>These observations agree with previous XANES results showing the formation of GaOx oligomers at Ga/Al > 0.3 [11]. The highest percentage of BAS consumption in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/Al ratios is similar (80%), suggesting a thermodynamic barrier rather than a purely diffusional one to achieve complete BAS replacement. One possible explanation is the formation of Ga oligomers in the zeolite micropores which become more energetically favorable than exchanging with the rest of BAS, as suggested by Bell and coworkers [11].</p>
<p>The dependence of the formation and relative abundance of the gallium hydride species formed upon reduction on the Ga/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios provides another dimension to differentiate different Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride (GaH, 2059 cm1) and Ga dihydride (GaH2, 2041 cm1) after reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 using DRIFTS.</p>
<p>The bands for these Ga- H stretching modes generally blueshift as Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1) cools down under vacuum (Fig. S8), which explains the slight shifts of the hydride bands reported in this work compared to those by Hensen and coworkers [27,28].</p>
<p>In-situ FTIR spectroscopy is employed to monitor the formation of Ga hydride species at 550 C on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with multiple Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios. After reducing the Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with different Ga/Al ratios with H2 (1 atm) at 550 C, bands corresponding to GaH and GaH2 (at 2053 cm1 and 2037 cm1, respectively) appeared after the cell was evacuated at the same temperature (Fig. 5a).</p>
<p>Pyridine FTIR spectra show that consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction does not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 (Fig. 3a and 4). These diverging trends for the Ga hydride formation and the BAS consumption indicate that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is clear evidence of the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species, in addition to the those remaining on the external surface of zeolite crystals (especially at higher Ga loadings) [11].</p>
<p>Water interacts extensively with Ga+ and GaHx species leading to distinct spectral features, and thus is an excellent probe molecule of Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. Several reports have mentioned that reduced Ga+ is sensitive to trace amounts of water [26,27], leading to its oxidation.</p>
<p>Upon water introduction to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 C, an intense band centered at 2052 cm1 appears (red trace of Fig. 7a(ix)), completely masking the GaHx bands in the same spectral range.</p>
<p>Introduction of water to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 C leads to the production of H2, in agreement with water acting as an oxidant (Fig. S13). Based on literature precedents and the water introduction reaction results, we assign the band at 2052 cm1 to GaOOH.</p>

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. Gallium species initially located on the external surface migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form gallium ions (Ga+). The exchange preference is towards single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ ions are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio. Gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not isolated Ga+ sites, providing evidence of the heterogeneity of exchanged gallium species.

2. The structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are revealed through the relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. Gallium species formed after reduction with hydrogen at 550°C exhibit different properties when exposed to water at 150°C. Gallium ions (Ga+) preferentially exchange with single protons in paired BAS sites, resulting in the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ ions are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio. Gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not isolated Ga+ sites, providing evidence of the heterogeneity of exchanged gallium species.

1. 在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝配对密度会影响活性镓物种的形成和性质。位于表面的镓物种迁移到沸石微孔中并与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）交换形成镓离子（Ga+）。在低Si/Al比样品中，单个氢键在配对BAS位点上更倾向于与Ga+交换。主要在高Si/Al比样品中产生孤立的Ga+离子。仅在Ga+H+配对位点上可以形成镓氢化物，而不是孤立的Ga+位点，这提供了交换镓物种异质性的证据。
