1. In the early studies, isolated Ga+ ions were identified as the predominant species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, regardless of the gallium loading and the reducing gas used, as reported by X-ray absorption studies [24,29]. This finding aligns with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10].

1. 在早期的研究中，孤立的Ga+离子被确定为Ga/H-ZSM-5的主要物种，无论镓的负载和使用的还原气体如何，这是通过X射线吸收研究[24,29]得出的。这一发现与Schreiber等人的最近报告一致[10]。

<p>Quantitative FTIR experiments with pyridine show that not all BAS can be exchanged by Ga species even at Ga/Al ratios up to 1.7 during the reduction treatment. Although results in Fig. 2 unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of the replacement of BAS with Ga species during the reduction treatment, it could be deceiving when used as the basis for quantitative analysis. This is because the BAS OH band of zeolite samples is easily obscured by the background at low densities [38]. To determine the density of the BAS left on Ga/H-ZSM-5 after reduction, pyridine was intro- duced to reduced samples at 150 C.</p>

2. Quantitative FTIR experiments using pyridine revealed that not all Brnsted acid sites (BAS) can be completely replaced by gallium species, even at high gallium to aluminum (Ga/Al) ratios up to 1.7 during the reduction process. The straightforward interpretation of the results presented in Figure 2, which clearly shows the replacement of BAS with Ga species during reduction, might be misleading for quantitative analysis. This is due to the BAS OH band in zeolite samples being easily masked by background noise at low densities [38]. To ascertain the BAS density remaining on Ga/H-ZSM-5 after reduction, pyridine was introduced to the reduced samples at 150 C.

2. 使用吡啶进行的定量FTIR实验表明，即使在高达1.7的镓到铝（Ga/Al）比值的情况下，也不一定能完全用镓物种替换掉所有Brnsted酸位点（BAS）。尽管图2中的结果明确显示了在减压过程中BAS被Ga物种取代的过程，但将其作为定量分析的基础可能会误导。这是因为低密度下的BAS OH带容易被背景噪音掩盖[38]。为了确定在减压后留在Ga/H-ZSM-5上的BAS密度，向减压样品引入吡啶在150 C下。

<p>Conducting the pyridine experiments on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples without air or water exposure is key to obtaining reliable BAS densities on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, as BAS can reappear upon catalyst re-oxidation (Fig. S3(v)). Thus, ex-situ methods such as NH3-TPD are unlikely to produce results relevant to reduced catalysts [11] unless proper catalyst pretreatment is included.</p>

3. Carrying out the pyridine experiments on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples without exposure to air or water is crucial for obtaining accurate BAS densities on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. BAS may reappear on the catalyst upon re-oxidation (Fig. S3(v)), so methods such as NH3-TPD performed ex-situ are not likely to yield relevant results for reduced catalysts [11] without appropriate pretreatment of the catalyst.

3. 对减压后的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品进行无空气或水暴露的吡啶实验对于获得减压后Ga/H-ZSM-5的可靠BAS密度至关重要。催化剂重新氧化（Fig. S3(v)）后，BAS可能重新出现，因此如NH3-TPD这样的离线方法不大可能产生与减压催化剂相关的相关结果[11]，除非对催化剂进行适当的预处理。

<p>Water interacts extensively with Ga+ and GaHx species leading to distinct spectral features, and thus is an excellent probe molecule of Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. Several reports have mentioned that reduced Ga+ is sensitive to trace amounts of water [26,27], leading to its oxidation. Introducing water vapor to reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 550 C leads to the appearance of bands at 3591 and 3662 cm1, attributable to recovered BAS and Ga(OH)x, respectively [26]. This suggests that water is able to oxidize Ga+ at this condition to reform BAS and Ga(OH)x (Scheme 2).</p>

4. Water interacts extensively with Ga+ and GaHx species, resulting in distinctive spectral characteristics, making it an ideal probe molecule for studying the speciation of Ga in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. Several studies have noted that reduced Ga+ is sensitive to trace amounts of water [26,27], causing its oxidation. When water vapor is introduced to reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 550 C, bands at 3591 and 3662 cm1 appear, corresponding to recovered BAS and Ga(OH)x, respectively [26]. This indicates that water can oxidize Ga+ under these conditions, regenerating BAS and Ga(OH)x (Scheme 2).

4. 水与Ga+和GaHx物种广泛相互作用，导致独特的光谱特征，这使得水成为研究减压后Ga/H-ZSM-5中Ga物种分布的理想探针分子。多项研究指出，减压后的Ga+对微量水分敏感[26,27]，导致其氧化。当将水蒸气引入Si/Al = 15、Ga/Al = 1.0的减压Ga/H-ZSM-5中并在550 C下处理时，出现波长分别为3591和3662 cm1的带，分别对应恢复的BAS和Ga(OH)x[26]。这表明在这些条件下水能够氧化Ga+，重新生成BAS和Ga(OH)x（方案2）。

<p>Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. The hypothesis that the exchanged Ga species exist in two distinct environments (isolated and paired with a neighboring proton), together with the spectral features observed upon water introduction (Figs. 7 and 8), lead to the prediction that water does not react with GaHx at 150 C. The intense band corresponding to GaOOH in most cases overwhelms the GaHx features, preventing the unambiguous identification of GaHx bands after water introduction. H-D exchange experiments were con- ducted to probe the reactivity of GaHx with water.</p>

5. Isotope labeling experiments confirm that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. The assumption that the exchanged Ga species exist in two separate environments (isolated and paired with a neighboring proton), along with the spectral patterns observed upon water introduction (Figs. 7 and 8), suggests that water does not interact with GaHx at 150 C. In most instances, the prominent band indicative of GaOOH obscures the GaHx features, hindering the clear identification of GaHx bands post-water introduction. H-D exchange experiments were carried out to assess the reactivity of GaHx with water.

5. 同位素标记实验证实，GaHx物种在150 C下不与水反应。假设交换的Ga物种存在于两种不同的环境中（孤立和与邻近质子配对），以及在水引入后观察到的光谱模式（图7和8），表明水在150 C下不会与GaHx发生反应。在大多数情况下，指示GaOOH的强烈带覆盖了GaHx特征，阻碍了水引入后清晰识别GaHx带。进行了H-D交换实验来探究GaHx与水的反应性。
