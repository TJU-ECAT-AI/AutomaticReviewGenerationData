How do the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and what do these relationships reveal about the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions?

549 (5-7) involve the release of H-atoms onto surface sites. Here, we show that many of these reactions, specifically alkane dehy- drogenation and dehydrocyclization on Te/NaX and on related Ga- and Cr-based mate- rials, are limited by the rate of desorption of these H-adatoms (4).

High hydrogen surface fugacities lead to low steady-state concentrations of alkene,diene, and triene species required in many dehydrocyclization reactions; these con- 0021-9517/92 $3.00 Copyright 1992 by Academic Press. Inc.

centrations reflect thermodynamic equili- bration with existing surface hydrogen fu- gacities rather than with gas-phase hydrogen pressures.

We suggest that high hydrogen surface fugacities also occur during hydrogen-trans- fer (5, 6) and disproportionation (7) reac- tions of hydrocarbons on surfaces. They arise because the catalytic surfaces are un- able to desorb hydrogen adatoms without raising their chemical potential and fugacity significantly above those in the ambient gas phase. These hydrogen-transfer reactions involve the addition and removal of hydro- gen atoms from a surface pool that remains largely nonequilibrated with gas-phase dihy- drogen. Consequently, such reactions kinet- ically resemble bimolecular transfer of H- atoms between two or more adsorbed hy- drocarbon species.

Ga ions introduce a recombinative desorption function that partially relieves the resulting high hydrogen surface fugacities and allows dehydrogenation steps to occur without concurrent cracking. Thus, Ga ions increase aromatics selectivity by providing a "porthole" for the removal of hydrogen adatoms as dihydrogen.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, by affecting the surface properties of the catalyst. Specifically, these ratios and densities determine the availability and reactivity of gallium ions, which are key for the formation of gallium hydrides. The gallium hydrides facilitate the hydrogen desorption process, acting as a "porthole" for the removal of hydrogen adatoms. This enhancement in hydrogen desorption rates is attributed to the gallium ions acting as catalysts for the rate-determining hydrogen desorption steps. As a result, the gallium-modified zeolite catalysts exhibit improved structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions due to the increased efficiency in hydrogen removal and the promotion of selective propane conversion to aromatics. The specific structure of the catalyst, characterized by the aforementioned parameters, enables better control over the hydrogen surface fugacity, thereby influencing the formation of active gallium species and ultimately the dehydrogenation reaction kinetics and product distribution.

在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物。这些比率和密度决定了催化剂表面的性质，从而影响了活性镓离子的形成和反应性，进而影响了镓氢化物的形成。镓氢化物促进了氢脱附过程，作为氢原子脱附的“通道”，加速了氢原子从表面的脱附。这种氢脱附速率的提高归因于镓离子作为催化氢脱附步骤的催化剂的作用。因此，Ga改性的沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的结构-活性相关性，由于氢脱附效率的提高和丙烷选择性转化为芳香族化合物的促进。催化剂的具体结构，由上述参数定义，能够更好地控制氢表面逸度，从而影响活性镓物种的形成和最终脱氢反应动力学及产物分布。
