[1] "Recombinative desorption limits the rate of n-heptane and methylcyclohexane aromatization on Te/NaX and prevents equilibration between gas-phase H2 and H-adatoms formed in intermediate dehydrogenation steps."

[2] "On H-ZSM5, hydrogen removal limits the rate of propane conversion to aromatics. Hydrogen adatoms are removed predominantly by reactions with coadsorbed hydrocarbon fragments, leading to high cracking selectivity."

[3] "Ga ions introduce a recombinative desorption function that partially relieves the resulting high hydrogen surface fugacities and allows dehydrogenation steps to occur without concurrent cracking."

[4] "We propose that rate-limiting hydrogen desorption steps, and the high surface hydrogen fugacities that result, control the rate and selectivity of dehydrogenation and related reactions on many nonmetal surfaces."

[5] "High surface hydrogen fugacities decrease the concentration of unsaturated intermediates by limiting them to values in equilibrium with surface hydrogen fugacities that significantly exceed gas-phase dihydrogen pressures."

[6] "Hydrogen desorption rates can be increased by metal ions such as Te +, Ga +,and others; they act as catalysts for the rate-determining hydrogen desorption steps."

1. The main findings indicate that hydrogen surface fugacities significantly impact the catalytic performance of Te/NaX, H-ZSM5, and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts during alkane reactions. High surface hydrogen fugacities prevent the formation of required unsaturated intermediates due to limitations in hydrogen desorption steps. Te ions catalyze rate-limiting hydrogen desorption steps during alkane reactions on Te/NaX. On H-ZSM5, hydrogen removal limits the rate of propane conversion to aromatics. Ga ions increase aromatics selectivity by providing a "porthole" for the removal of hydrogen adatoms as dihydrogen, partially relieving high hydrogen surface fugacities.

2. Ga ions affect the dehydrogenation and hydrogen removal processes by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adatoms, which reduces the hydrogen surface fugacity. This leads to an increase in aromatics selectivity without concurrent cracking events, enhancing the efficiency of propane conversion.

3. The proposed mechanism for hydrogen desorption involves heterolytic recombination of H+ and H- species, facilitated by low-valent metal ions like Te and Ga. These ions act as Lewis acids stabilizing the negative charge in hydride ions, promoting hydrogen desorption.

4. Hydrogen surface fugacities influence the selectivity of alkane dehydrogenation reactions by controlling the concentration of unsaturated intermediates. High surface hydrogen fugacities limit these intermediates, affecting the overall reaction rates and product distributions.

5. Hydrogen surface fugacities play a critical role in the catalytic performance of Te/NaX and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts. They prevent the formation of required unsaturated intermediates due to limitations in hydrogen desorption steps. Te ions catalyze rate-limiting hydrogen desorption steps on Te/NaX, while Ga ions introduce a "porthole" for hydrogen desorption, reducing hydrogen surface fugacities and improving selectivity.

6. The experimental evidence supports the proposed mechanism through kinetic coupling and hydrogen surface fugacity analysis. The findings highlight the importance of hydrogen surface fugacities in controlling the rate and selectivity of alkane dehydrogenation reactions on Te/NaX and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts.

1. 主要发现表明，氢表面逸度在Te/NaX、H-ZSM5和Ga/H-ZSM5催化剂上的烷烃反应中对催化性能产生了显著影响。高氢表面逸度限制了所需不饱和中间体的形成，由于氢脱附步骤的限制。Te离子催化Te/NaX上烷烃反应的限速氢脱附步骤。在H-ZSM5上，氢脱附限制了丙烷转化为芳香族化合物的速度。Ga离子通过提供一个“通道”来减少氢表面逸度，加速氢脱附过程，从而增加芳香族选择性，而不会发生并发裂解事件，提高了丙烷转化的效率。

2. Ga离子通过催化氢脱附过程，促进氢原子与表面氢原子的再组合，降低氢表面逸度，从而影响脱氢和氢脱除过程。这导致了在没有并发裂解事件的情况下提高芳香族选择性，增强丙烷转化的效率。

3. 氢表面逸度的机制涉及氢正离子和氢负离子的异裂，由低价金属离子如Te和Ga催化。这些离子作为路易斯酸稳定负电荷的氢离子，促进氢脱附。

4. 氢表面逸度通过控制不饱和中间体的浓度影响烷烃脱氢反应的选择性。高氢表面逸度限制这些中间体，影响整体反应速率和产物分布。

5. 氢表面逸度对于Te/NaX和Ga/H-ZSM5催化剂的催化性能至关重要。它们限制了所需不饱和中间体的形成，由于氢脱附步骤的限制。Te离子催化Te/NaX上的限速氢脱附步骤，而Ga离子通过提供一个“通道”来降低氢表面逸度，改善选择性。

6. 实验证据支持提出的机制，通过动力学耦合和氢表面逸度分析。研究结果强调了氢表面逸度在控制Te/NaX和Ga/H-ZSM5催化剂上烷烃脱氢反应速率和选择性的关键作用。
