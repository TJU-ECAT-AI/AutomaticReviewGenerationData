"The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."
"As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."
"On reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) at 550 C, the GaHx band (2037 and 2053 cm1) was absent regardless of the Ga/Al ratio, supporting the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs."
"The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
"In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
"These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction."
"Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."
"When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection."
"Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."
"The composition of the divalent cationic Ga species was deducted by the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 via a quantitative pulse titration method."
"In a typical experiment (Figure 8a), the reduction of as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7) with 10 vol% H2/N2 at 550 C led to significant H2O formation, evidencing the reduction of the supported Ga2O3."
"Determination of the amounts of H2O formed during the reduction and O2 consumed in the subsequent oxidation provide direct evidence for the change in the oxidation state of Ga species in the reduced and oxidized sample."
"The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction, and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) was 1.5 (Figure 8b)."
"Three important features were observed in the pulse titration results (Figure 8c): i) On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), no appreciable amount of water or oxygen was formed or consumed, respectively, indicating that Ga species in this sample could not be reduced by H2."
"As the Ga/BAS ratio increased to 0.7, O consumption rose almost linearly with a Ga/O ratio of unity, that is, the majority of Ga3+ was reduced to Ga+ after H2 treatment within this Ga/BAS range."
"Further increase in the Ga loading did not lead to an increase in the O2 consumption, suggesting the presence of a different, redox-inactive, GaOx species."
"Pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)), in which all framework Al pairs were occupied by Co2+, were similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM (15, Y) except for a key feature (Figure 8d,e): there was no redox inactive Ga species at very low Ga loading in Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, 0.05), in contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042)."
"Based on the titration results, 10% of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) were exchanged with Ga2O22+ (Figure 8c), which was lower than the density of Al pairs determined by the Co2+ exchange method (35%)."
"Ga2O22+ was calculated to be the most stable Ga species around framework Al pairs in MOR zeolites;[130] a similar calculation in MFI has yet to be reported."
"The intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites were estimated by determining the slope between TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at different Ga/Al ratio ranges, which represented the TOF normalized per unit of added Ga (TOFGa)."
"On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the slope of the TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at Ga/Al ratios below 0.042 was 0.60  0.09 molC3H8 molGa1 s1 (Figure 9b)."
"In addition to Ga/H-ZSM-5, Ga exchanged on CHA[56] has also been studied. Lobo and co-workers[56] investigated the Ga speciation and PDH of Ga/H-CHA and found that only extra-framework Ga+ sites were formed upon reduction of Ga/H-CHA catalyst, independent of Si/Al ratios."
"Lercher and co-workers[132] recently reported a highly selective Ga-modified BEA zeolite catalyst for PDH with 82% selectivity for propylene at 19% propane conversion. The active sites have been identified as dehydrated and tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ in the *BEA framework."

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, through their correlation with the density of framework aluminum pairs. Higher Si/Al ratios reduce the amount of exchangeable Co2+ ions, impacting the stability of gallium species. The correlation between the amount of gallium hydrides (GaHx) and framework aluminum pairs indicates that GaHx likely originates from divalent cationic gallium species. Gallium hydrides exhibit varying intensities depending on the Ga/Al ratio, peaking at a ratio of 0.1 before declining, suggesting a relationship between the gallium concentration and the formation of GaHx. The consumption of the basic structure (BAS) by gallium exchange does not cease until the Ga/Al ratio surpasses 0.7, indicating the role of gallium in stabilizing divalent cationic species. The gallium species are likely divalent cations that form gallium hydrides upon reduction.

2. The gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts play a crucial role in the propane dehydrogenation reaction mechanism. The gallium hydrides and gallium species correlate with the structure of the zeolite, particularly the density of framework aluminum pairs, influencing the catalytic activity. The gallium hydrides form as a result of gallium species interacting with the framework aluminum pairs, which stabilize divalent cationic gallium species. The gallium species can be deduced from the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced gallium, showing a linear correlation between the framework aluminum pair density and the amount of gallium hydrides. The gallium hydrides exhibit different behaviors with respect to the gallium/Al ratio, with a peak intensity at a ratio of 0.1, declining as the ratio increases, indicating a specific relationship between gallium concentration and the formation of gallium hydrides. The gallium species' role in the propane dehydrogenation mechanism is influenced by the gallium/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density, affecting the formation and nature of gallium hydrides and the overall catalytic activity of the zeolite catalyst.
