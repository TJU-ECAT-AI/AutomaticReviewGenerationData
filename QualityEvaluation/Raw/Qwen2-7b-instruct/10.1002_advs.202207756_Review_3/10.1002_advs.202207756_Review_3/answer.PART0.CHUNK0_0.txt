"The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."
"As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."
"On reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) at 550 C, the GaHx band (2037 and 2053 cm1) was absent regardless of the Ga/Al ratio, supporting the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs."
"The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
"In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
"These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."
"Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."
"When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection."
"Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."
"The composition of the divalent cationic Ga species was deducted by the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 via a quantitative pulse titration method."
"In a typical experiment (Figure 8a), the reduction of as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7) with 10 vol% H2/N2 at 550 C led to significant H2O formation, evidencing the reduction of the supported Ga2O3."
"Determination of the amounts of H2O formed during the reduction and O2 consumed in the subsequent oxidation provide direct evidence for the change in the oxidation state of Ga species in the reduced and oxidized sample."
"The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction, and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) was 1.5 (Figure 8b)."
"Three important features were observed in the pulse titration results (Figure 8c): i) On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), no appreciable amount of water or oxygen was formed or consumed, respectively, indicating that Ga species in this sample could not be reduced by H2."
"As the Ga/BAS ratio increased to 0.7, O consumption rose almost linearly with a Ga/O ratio of unity, that is, the majority of Ga3+ was reduced to Ga+ after H2 treatment within this Ga/BAS range."
"Further increase in the Ga loading did not lead to an increase in the O2 consumption, suggesting the presence of a different, redox-inactive, GaOx species."
"Pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)), in which all framework Al pairs were occupied by Co2+, were similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM (15, Y) except for a key feature (Figure 8d,e): there was no redox inactive Ga species at very low Ga loading in Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, 0.05), in contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042)."
"Based on the titration results, 10% of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) were exchanged with Ga2O22+ (Figure 8c), which was lower than the density of Al pairs determined by the Co2+ exchange method (35%)."
"Ga2O22+ as a catalytic PDH site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 was first proposed by Hensen and co-workers in a different context."
"Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5."
"Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."
"The intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites were estimated by determining the slope between TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at different Ga/Al ratio ranges, which represented the TOF normalized per unit of added Ga (TOFGa)."
"The TOFGa was similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042-0.21), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, 0.15-0.46), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0-0.55); this implies that the same type of Ga species was introduced in all three samples in their respective Ga/Al ratio ranges."
"In addition to Ga/H-ZSM-5, Ga exchanged on CHA[56] has also been studied."
"Lercher and co-workers[132] recently reported a highly selective Ga-modified BEA zeolite catalyst for PDH with 82% selectivity for propylene at 19% propane conversion."
"To date, proposed PDH mechanisms on Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be broadly categorized into carbenium and alkyl mechanisms."
"The carbenium mechanism claims that C3H8 is initially activated on the BAS to form a carbenium ion, and the role of Ga is to facilitate the recombination of the H atom on the catalyst surface to form H2, thereby increasing the reaction rate."
"Different from the carbocation intermediate and H2 desorption RDS in the carbenium mechanism, Bell and co-workers proposed that the activation of the CH bond in propane leading to the formation of [C3H7-GaH]+ was the RDS in PDH."

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. Specifically, the density of framework Al pairs correlates with the formation of GaHx species. The amount of exchanged Co2+ decreases with an increase in the Si/Al ratio. The Ga/Al ratio affects the formation of GaHx and the consumption of framework Al pairs. Higher Ga/Al ratios lead to different trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of framework Al pairs, indicating that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction. The relationship between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx shows a linear correlation, suggesting that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species.

2. The structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions revealed through the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density demonstrate the importance of these parameters in determining the activity and selectivity of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. The specific interactions between gallium species, the framework structure, and the reaction conditions affect the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation, leading to variations in product distribution, selectivity, and overall catalytic performance.

1. Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和沸石框架铝对对在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物。特别是，框架铝对的数量与GaHx物种的形成成正比。随着Si/Al比的增加，交换的Co2+数量减少。Ga/Al比影响GaHx的形成和框架铝对的消耗。较高的Ga/Al比导致形成GaHx和消耗框架铝对的趋势不同，表明并非所有二价镓物种都能在还原后形成Ga氢化物。框架铝对密度与GaHx数量之间的线性关系表明，GaHx的前体很可能是二价的阳离子物种。

2. Ga改性沸石催化剂中，通过Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响揭示了丙烷脱氢反应的结构-活性相关性。这些参数的特定相互作用，以及反应条件，影响丙烷脱氢的效率，导致产品分布、选择性和整体催化性能的变化。
