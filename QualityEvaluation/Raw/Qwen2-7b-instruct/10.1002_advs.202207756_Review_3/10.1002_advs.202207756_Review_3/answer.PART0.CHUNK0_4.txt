"The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."
"As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."
"On reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) at 550 C, the GaHx band (2037 and 2053 cm1) was absent regardless of the Ga/Al ratio, supporting the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs."
"In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
"The correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."
"The composition of the divalent cationic Ga species was deducted by the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 via a quantitative pulse titration method."
"Determination of the amounts of H2O formed during the reduction and O2 consumed in the subsequent oxidation provide direct evidence for the change in the oxidation state of Ga species in the reduced and oxidized sample."
"The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction, and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) was 1.5."
"Three important features were observed in the pulse titration results (Figure 8c): i) On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), no appreciable amount of water or oxygen was formed or consumed, respectively, indicating that Ga species in this sample could not be reduced by H2."
"As the Ga/BAS ratio increased to 0.7, O consumption rose almost linearly with a Ga/O ratio of unity, that is, the majority of Ga3+ was reduced to Ga+ after H2 treatment within this Ga/BAS range."
"Further increase in the Ga loading did not lead to an increase in the O2 consumption, suggesting the presence of a different, redox-inactive, GaOx species."
"Pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)), in which all framework Al pairs were occupied by Co2+, were similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM (15, Y) except for a key feature (Figure 8d,e): there was no redox-inactive Ga species at very low Ga loading in Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, 0.05), in contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042)."
"Based on the pulse titration results, 10% of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) were exchanged with Ga2O22+ (Figure 8c), which was lower than the density of Al pairs determined by the Co2+ exchange method (35%)."
"Ga2O22+ as a catalytic PDH site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 was first proposed by Hensen and co-workers in a different context."
"Enhanced PDH activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 was observed when steam was co-fed with propane, and the Ga2O22+ moiety was proposed based on the fitting of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra."
"DFT calculations indicated that the key difference between Ga+ and Ga2O22+ was the stability of their oxidized form, that is, [GaO]+ and Ga2O22+, in the reducing environment at high temperatures."
"Ga2O22+ was calculated to be the most stable Ga species around framework Al pairs in MOR zeolites;[130] a similar calculation in MFI has yet to be reported."
"Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5."
"On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."
"The intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites were estimated by determining the slope between TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at different Ga/Al ratio ranges, which represented the TOF normalized per unit of added Ga (TOFGa)."
"In the low Ga loading range, the integrated area of the GaHx band grew with the PDH rate in both Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 9c)."
"2.2 Gallium's Role in PDH Mechanism"
"To date, proposed PDH mechanisms on Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be broadly categorized into carbenium and alkyl mechanisms."
"The carbenium mechanism claims that C3H8 is initially activated on the BAS to form a carbenium ion, and the role of Ga is to facilitate the recombination of the H atom on the catalyst surface to form H2, thereby increasing the reaction rate."
"Different from the carbocation intermediate and H2 desorption RDS in the carbenium mechanism, Bell and co-workers proposed that the activation of the CH bond in propane leading to the formation of [C3H7-GaH]+ was the RDS in PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and these relationships reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions in several ways:

1. The density of framework aluminum pairs can be used to predict the amount of exchanged gallium ions, as seen in H-ZSM-5 zeolites. Higher Si/Al ratios result in less gallium being exchanged due to competition for binding sites.

2. Gallium hydrides (GaHx) correlate with the density of framework aluminum pairs, indicating that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species.

3. The gallium/Al ratio affects the consumption of basic aluminum sites (BAS) by gallium exchange upon reduction. The process stops only when the gallium/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples.

4. The gallium/Al ratio influences the formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) and the consumption of BAS, showing that not all gallium species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction.

5. Gallium species with a divalent cationic state are likely responsible for the formation of gallium hydrides, as deduced through pulse titration methods.

6. Gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 are characterized by their ability to reduce to Ga+ from Ga2O3, and further to Ga3+ upon oxidation, providing insight into their redox properties.

7. Gallium species such as Ga2O22+ are identified as the most active PDH (propane dehydrogenation) sites, influencing the intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites.

8. The relationship between the Si/Al ratio, Ga/Al ratio, and gallium species suggests that the structure of the zeolite and gallium loading determine the activity of the catalyst in PDH reactions.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between the physical structure of Ga-modified zeolites and the chemical properties of gallium species, which ultimately dictate the performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

在Ga改性的沸石催化剂中，Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性：

1. 框架铝对的数量可以用来预测交换的镓离子量，尤其是在高Si/Al比的沸石中，较高的Si/Al比导致较少的镓被交换。

2. 镓氢化物（GaHx）与框架铝对的数量相关，这表明GaHx的前体可能是二价的镓离子性物种。

3. 镓/Al比影响基本铝位（BAS）的消耗，只有当镓/Al比超过0.7时，这个过程才会在两种样品中停止。

4. 镓/Al比影响镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成和BAS的消耗，显示并非所有镓物种都能在还原后形成Ga氢化物。

5. 通过脉冲滴定方法可以推断出，在Ga/H-ZSM-5中，具有二价电荷状态的镓物种可能是形成Ga氢化物的原因。

6. Ga/H-ZSM-5中的镓物种通过从Ga2O3还原到Ga+，然后进一步氧化到Ga3+，提供关于它们的还原性质的见解。

7. Ga2O22+被识别为最活跃的PDH（丙烷脱氢）位点，影响Ga位点的内在反应速率。

8. Si/Al比、Ga/Al比和镓物种之间的关系表明，催化剂结构和镓负载决定了PDH反应中催化剂的性能。

这些发现强调了Ga改性沸石结构和镓物种化学性质之间复杂相互作用的重要性，这些相互作用最终决定了催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的表现。
