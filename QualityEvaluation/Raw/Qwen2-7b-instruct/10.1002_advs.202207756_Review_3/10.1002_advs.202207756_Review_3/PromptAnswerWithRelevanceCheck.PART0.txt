"The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."
"As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."
"On reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) at 550 C, the GaHx band (2037 and 2053 cm1) was absent regardless of the Ga/Al ratio, supporting the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs."
"The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
"In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
"These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."
"Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."
"When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection."
"Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."
"The composition of the divalent cationic Ga species was deducted by the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 via a quantitative pulse titration method."
"In a typical experiment (Figure 8a), the reduction of as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7) with 10 vol% H2/N2 at 550 C led to significant H2O formation, evidencing the reduction of the supported Ga2O3."
"Determination of the amounts of H2O formed during the reduction and O2 consumed in the subsequent oxidation provide direct evidence for the change in the oxidation state of Ga species in the reduced and oxidized sample."
"The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction, and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) was 1.5 (Figure 8b)."
"Three important features were observed in the pulse titration results (Figure 8c): i) On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), no appreciable amount of water or oxygen was formed or consumed, respectively, indicating that Ga species in this sample could not be reduced by H2."
"As the Ga/BAS ratio increased to 0.7, O consumption rose almost linearly with a Ga/O ratio of unity, that is, the majority of Ga3+ was reduced to Ga+ after H2 treatment within this Ga/BAS range."
"Further increase in the Ga loading did not lead to an increase in the O2 consumption, suggesting the presence of a different, redox-inactive, GaOx species."
"Pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)), in which all framework Al pairs were occupied by Co2+, were similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM (15, Y) except for a key feature (Figure 8d,e): there was no redox inactive Ga species at very low Ga loading in Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, 0.05), in contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042)."
"Based on the titration results, 10% of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) were exchanged with Ga2O22+ (Figure 8c), which was lower than the density of Al pairs determined by the Co2+ exchange method (35%)."
"Ga2O22+ as a catalytic PDH site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 was first proposed by Hensen and co-workers in a different context."
"Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5."
"Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."
"The intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites were estimated by determining the slope between TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at different Ga/Al ratio ranges, which represented the TOF normalized per unit of added Ga (TOFGa)."
"The TOFGa was similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042-0.21), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, 0.15-0.46), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0-0.55); this implies that the same type of Ga species was introduced in all three samples in their respective Ga/Al ratio ranges."
"In addition to Ga/H-ZSM-5, Ga exchanged on CHA[56] has also been studied."
"Lercher and co-workers[132] recently reported a highly selective Ga-modified BEA zeolite catalyst for PDH with 82% selectivity for propylene at 19% propane conversion."
"To date, proposed PDH mechanisms on Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be broadly categorized into carbenium and alkyl mechanisms."
"The carbenium mechanism claims that C3H8 is initially activated on the BAS to form a carbenium ion, and the role of Ga is to facilitate the recombination of the H atom on the catalyst surface to form H2, thereby increasing the reaction rate."
"Different from the carbocation intermediate and H2 desorption RDS in the carbenium mechanism, Bell and co-workers proposed that the activation of the CH bond in propane leading to the formation of [C3H7-GaH]+ was the RDS in PDH."

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. Specifically, the density of framework Al pairs correlates with the formation of GaHx species. The amount of exchanged Co2+ decreases with an increase in the Si/Al ratio. The Ga/Al ratio affects the formation of GaHx and the consumption of framework Al pairs. Higher Ga/Al ratios lead to different trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of framework Al pairs, indicating that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction. The relationship between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx shows a linear correlation, suggesting that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species.

2. The structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions revealed through the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density demonstrate the importance of these parameters in determining the activity and selectivity of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. The specific interactions between gallium species, the framework structure, and the reaction conditions affect the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation, leading to variations in product distribution, selectivity, and overall catalytic performance.

1. Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和沸石框架铝对对在Ga改性沸石催化剂中，影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物。特别是，框架铝对的数量与GaHx物种的形成成正比。随着Si/Al比的增加，交换的Co2+数量减少。Ga/Al比影响GaHx的形成和框架铝对的消耗。较高的Ga/Al比导致形成GaHx和消耗框架铝对的趋势不同，表明并非所有二价镓物种都能在还原后形成Ga氢化物。框架铝对密度与GaHx数量之间的线性关系表明，GaHx的前体很可能是二价的阳离子物种。

2. Ga改性沸石催化剂中，通过Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响揭示了丙烷脱氢反应的结构-活性相关性。这些参数的特定相互作用，以及反应条件，影响丙烷脱氢的效率，导致产品分布、选择性和整体催化性能的变化。

1. The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, through their correlation with the density of framework aluminum pairs. Higher Si/Al ratios reduce the amount of exchangeable Co2+ ions, impacting the stability of gallium species. The correlation between the amount of gallium hydrides (GaHx) and framework aluminum pairs indicates that GaHx likely originates from divalent cationic gallium species. Gallium hydrides exhibit varying intensities depending on the Ga/Al ratio, peaking at a ratio of 0.1 before declining, suggesting a relationship between the gallium concentration and the formation of GaHx. The consumption of the basic structure (BAS) by gallium exchange does not cease until the Ga/Al ratio surpasses 0.7, indicating the role of gallium in stabilizing divalent cationic species. The gallium species are likely divalent cations that form gallium hydrides upon reduction.

2. The gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts play a crucial role in the propane dehydrogenation reaction mechanism. The gallium hydrides and gallium species correlate with the structure of the zeolite, particularly the density of framework aluminum pairs, influencing the catalytic activity. The gallium hydrides form as a result of gallium species interacting with the framework aluminum pairs, which stabilize divalent cationic gallium species. The gallium species can be deduced from the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced gallium, showing a linear correlation between the framework aluminum pair density and the amount of gallium hydrides. The gallium hydrides exhibit different behaviors with respect to the gallium/Al ratio, with a peak intensity at a ratio of 0.1, declining as the ratio increases, indicating a specific relationship between gallium concentration and the formation of gallium hydrides. The gallium species' role in the propane dehydrogenation mechanism is influenced by the gallium/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density, affecting the formation and nature of gallium hydrides and the overall catalytic activity of the zeolite catalyst.

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions in several ways:

1. **Gallium Hydrides Formation**: The amount of gallium hydrides (GaHx) formed depends on the Ga/Al ratio and the density of framework aluminum pairs. Higher Ga/Al ratios lead to more gallium hydrides, and the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species.

2. **Active Site Composition**: The composition of gallium species changes with the Ga/Al ratio. At low ratios, gallium is predominantly in the +3 oxidation state, while at higher ratios, gallium forms redox-inactive GaOx species. Ga2O22+ is identified as the most active PDH species, especially in samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15.

3. **Propane Dehydrogenation Rate**: The intrinsic reaction rates of gallium sites, quantified by TOFGa, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio. For samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the TOFGa shows distinct behavior across different Ga/Al ratio ranges, indicating the introduction of a specific type of gallium species.

4. **Catalyst Structure-Activity Relationships**: The relationship between gallium species, their hydride formation, and the PDH activity reveals how the structure of the catalyst affects its performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This understanding helps in optimizing catalyst design for enhanced propane conversion efficiency.

These relationships highlight the importance of controlling the gallium loading and the zeolite's framework properties to achieve optimal catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation processes.

3. **丙烷脱氢速率**：镓位点的内在反应速率，通过TOFGa量化，受镓/铝比例的影响。对于Si/Al比例为15的样品，在不同的镓/铝比例范围内，TOFGa表现出明显的差异行为，表明引入了一种特定类型的镓物种。

4. **催化剂结构-活性关系**：理解镓物种、它们的氢化物形成和PDH活性之间的关系揭示了催化剂结构如何影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。这一理解有助于优化催化剂设计，以提高丙烷转化效率。

这些关系强调了控制镓负载和沸石骨架属性的重要性，以实现丙烷脱氢过程的最佳催化活性。

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in several ways. 

1. **Ga/Al Ratio**: This ratio affects the amount of gallium exchanged with the zeolite framework. Higher Ga/Al ratios can lead to a greater number of gallium ions incorporated into the zeolite structure, which can influence the formation of gallium hydrides and the activity of the catalyst. In the context of propane dehydrogenation, gallium species in the zeolite can act as active centers for the reaction.

2. **Si/Al Ratio**: The silicon-to-aluminum ratio in the zeolite framework impacts the structure and stability of the catalyst. Changes in this ratio can alter the density of framework aluminum pairs, which in turn affects the ability of the zeolite to accommodate gallium ions and the formation of gallium hydrides. This is crucial for the efficiency of the propane dehydrogenation process.

3. **Framework Aluminum Pair Density**: The density of aluminum pairs in the zeolite framework is directly related to the availability of sites for gallium exchange. Only pairs of adjacent framework negative charges can balance a divalent cation such as gallium. Therefore, the density of these pairs determines how many gallium ions can be accommodated in the zeolite structure. Gallium hydrides are formed preferentially at these sites, which suggests that they play a key role in the catalytic activity of the zeolite towards propane dehydrogenation.

These relationships reveal structure-activity correlations in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The precise nature of the gallium species (whether they are Ga+ or Ga2O22+) depends on the specific conditions of the catalyst preparation, including the Ga/Al ratio and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium hydride formation is closely tied to the framework aluminum pair density, indicating that these pairs serve as the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

In summary, the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density collectively determine the type and concentration of gallium species in the zeolite catalyst, which in turn influences the activity and selectivity of the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Understanding these correlations is essential for optimizing the performance of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts.

1. **镓/铝比**：此比率影响与沸石骨架交换的镓离子的数量。较高的镓/铝比可能导致更多数量的镓离子嵌入到沸石结构中，这会影响镓氢化物的形成以及催化剂的活性。在丙烷脱氢的背景下，沸石中的镓物种可以作为反应的活性中心。

2. **硅/铝比**：沸石骨架中的硅与铝的比例影响其结构和稳定性。改变这个比例可以改变骨架中铝对的密度，从而影响镓离子的容纳能力以及镓氢化物的形成。这对丙烷脱氢过程的效率至关重要。

3. **骨架铝对密度**：骨架铝对的密度直接关系到催化剂中镓离子的可用性。只有相邻骨架负电荷对才能平衡二价离子，如镓。因此，这些对的密度决定了多少镓离子可以容纳在沸石结构中。镓氢化物在这些位置优先形成，这表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中的关键作用。

这些关系揭示了镓改性沸石催化剂中丙烷脱氢的结构活性相关性。特定条件下的催化剂制备（包括镓/铝比和骨架铝对密度）决定了沸石催化剂中镓物种的确切类型和浓度，这进而影响了催化剂的活性和选择性。了解这些相关性对于优化镓改性沸石催化剂的性能至关重要。

简而言之，镓/铝比、硅/铝比和骨架铝对密度共同决定沸石催化剂中镓物种的类型和浓度，这进而影响了催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的活性和选择性。理解这些相关性是优化镓改性沸石催化剂性能的关键。

"The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."
"As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."
"On reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) at 550 C, the GaHx band (2037 and 2053 cm1) was absent regardless of the Ga/Al ratio, supporting the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs."
"In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
"The correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."
"The composition of the divalent cationic Ga species was deducted by the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 via a quantitative pulse titration method."
"Determination of the amounts of H2O formed during the reduction and O2 consumed in the subsequent oxidation provide direct evidence for the change in the oxidation state of Ga species in the reduced and oxidized sample."
"The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction, and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) was 1.5."
"Three important features were observed in the pulse titration results (Figure 8c): i) On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), no appreciable amount of water or oxygen was formed or consumed, respectively, indicating that Ga species in this sample could not be reduced by H2."
"As the Ga/BAS ratio increased to 0.7, O consumption rose almost linearly with a Ga/O ratio of unity, that is, the majority of Ga3+ was reduced to Ga+ after H2 treatment within this Ga/BAS range."
"Further increase in the Ga loading did not lead to an increase in the O2 consumption, suggesting the presence of a different, redox-inactive, GaOx species."
"Pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)), in which all framework Al pairs were occupied by Co2+, were similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM (15, Y) except for a key feature (Figure 8d,e): there was no redox-inactive Ga species at very low Ga loading in Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, 0.05), in contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042)."
"Based on the pulse titration results, 10% of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) were exchanged with Ga2O22+ (Figure 8c), which was lower than the density of Al pairs determined by the Co2+ exchange method (35%)."
"Ga2O22+ as a catalytic PDH site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 was first proposed by Hensen and co-workers in a different context."
"Enhanced PDH activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 was observed when steam was co-fed with propane, and the Ga2O22+ moiety was proposed based on the fitting of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra."
"DFT calculations indicated that the key difference between Ga+ and Ga2O22+ was the stability of their oxidized form, that is, [GaO]+ and Ga2O22+, in the reducing environment at high temperatures."
"Ga2O22+ was calculated to be the most stable Ga species around framework Al pairs in MOR zeolites;[130] a similar calculation in MFI has yet to be reported."
"Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5."
"On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."
"The intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites were estimated by determining the slope between TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at different Ga/Al ratio ranges, which represented the TOF normalized per unit of added Ga (TOFGa)."
"In the low Ga loading range, the integrated area of the GaHx band grew with the PDH rate in both Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 9c)."
"2.2 Gallium's Role in PDH Mechanism"
"To date, proposed PDH mechanisms on Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be broadly categorized into carbenium and alkyl mechanisms."
"The carbenium mechanism claims that C3H8 is initially activated on the BAS to form a carbenium ion, and the role of Ga is to facilitate the recombination of the H atom on the catalyst surface to form H2, thereby increasing the reaction rate."
"Different from the carbocation intermediate and H2 desorption RDS in the carbenium mechanism, Bell and co-workers proposed that the activation of the CH bond in propane leading to the formation of [C3H7-GaH]+ was the RDS in PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and these relationships reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions in several ways:

1. The density of framework aluminum pairs can be used to predict the amount of exchanged gallium ions, as seen in H-ZSM-5 zeolites. Higher Si/Al ratios result in less gallium being exchanged due to competition for binding sites.

2. Gallium hydrides (GaHx) correlate with the density of framework aluminum pairs, indicating that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species.

3. The gallium/Al ratio affects the consumption of basic aluminum sites (BAS) by gallium exchange upon reduction. The process stops only when the gallium/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples.

4. The gallium/Al ratio influences the formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) and the consumption of BAS, showing that not all gallium species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction.

5. Gallium species with a divalent cationic state are likely responsible for the formation of gallium hydrides, as deduced through pulse titration methods.

6. Gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 are characterized by their ability to reduce to Ga+ from Ga2O3, and further to Ga3+ upon oxidation, providing insight into their redox properties.

7. Gallium species such as Ga2O22+ are identified as the most active PDH (propane dehydrogenation) sites, influencing the intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites.

8. The relationship between the Si/Al ratio, Ga/Al ratio, and gallium species suggests that the structure of the zeolite and gallium loading determine the activity of the catalyst in PDH reactions.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between the physical structure of Ga-modified zeolites and the chemical properties of gallium species, which ultimately dictate the performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
