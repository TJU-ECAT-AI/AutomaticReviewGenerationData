"The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."
"As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."
"On reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) at 550 C, the GaHx band (2037 and 2053 cm1) was absent regardless of the Ga/Al ratio, supporting the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs."
"The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
"In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
"These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."
"The correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species."
"The composition of the divalent cationic Ga species was deducted by the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 via a quantitative pulse titration method."
"Determination of the amounts of H2O formed during the reduction and O2 consumed in the subsequent oxidation provide direct evidence for the change in the oxidation state of Ga species in the reduced and oxidized sample."
"The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction, and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) was 1.5 (Figure 8b)."
"Three important features were observed in the pulse titration results (Figure 8c): i) On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), no appreciable amount of water or oxygen was formed or consumed, respectively, indicating that Ga species in this sample could not be reduced by H2."
"As the Ga/BAS ratio increased to 0.7, O consumption rose almost linearly with a Ga/O ratio of unity, that is, the majority of Ga3+ was reduced to Ga+ after H2 treatment within this Ga/BAS range."
"Further increase in the Ga loading did not lead to an increase in the O2 consumption, suggesting the presence of a different, redox-inactive, GaOx species."
"Considering the 1:1 Ga/BAS exchange ratio in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the only possible composition of the redox-inactive Ga species is Ga2O22+."
"Ga2O22+ as a catalytic PDH site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 was first proposed by Hensen and co-workers in a different context."
"Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."
"The intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites were estimated by determining the slope between TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at different Ga/Al ratio ranges, which represented the TOF normalized per unit of added Ga (TOFGa)."
"The TOFGa was similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042-0.21), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, 0.15-0.46), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0-0.55); this implies that the same type of Ga species was introduced in all three samples in their respective Ga/Al ratio ranges."
"TOFGa was already low (0.05  0.01 molC3H8 molGa1 s1) at the lowest Ga loading evaluated (Figure 9b)."
"It is noteworthy that the TOFGa was similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042-0.21), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, 0.15-0.46), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0-0.55); this implies that the same type of Ga species was introduced in all three samples in their respective Ga/Al ratio ranges."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions in several ways:

1. **Gallium Hydrides Formation**: The amount of gallium hydrides (GaHx) formed depends on the Ga/Al ratio and the density of framework aluminum pairs. Higher Ga/Al ratios lead to more gallium hydrides, and the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species.

2. **Active Site Composition**: The composition of gallium species changes with the Ga/Al ratio. At low ratios, gallium is predominantly in the +3 oxidation state, while at higher ratios, gallium forms redox-inactive GaOx species. Ga2O22+ is identified as the most active PDH species, especially in samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15.

3. **Propane Dehydrogenation Rate**: The intrinsic reaction rates of gallium sites, quantified by TOFGa, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio. For samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the TOFGa shows distinct behavior across different Ga/Al ratio ranges, indicating the introduction of a specific type of gallium species.

4. **Catalyst Structure-Activity Relationships**: The relationship between gallium species, their hydride formation, and the PDH activity reveals how the structure of the catalyst affects its performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This understanding helps in optimizing catalyst design for enhanced propane conversion efficiency.

These relationships highlight the importance of controlling the gallium loading and the zeolite's framework properties to achieve optimal catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation processes.

在改性沸石催化剂中，镓/铝比例、硅/铝比例和框架铝对的比例影响活性镓物种的形成及其性质，包括镓氢化物，并揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性：

1. **镓氢化物的形成**：镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成取决于镓/铝比例和框架铝对密度。较高的镓/铝比例导致更多镓氢化物的形成，并且GaHx与框架Al对之间的相关性表明GaHx的前体很可能是二价的镓物种。

2. **活性位点组成**：镓物种的组成随镓/铝比例变化。在低比例下，镓主要以+3氧化状态存在，而在高比例下，则形成不可还原的GaOx物种。Ga2O22+被确认为催化PDH的最活跃物种，特别是在Si/Al比例为15的样品中。

3. **丙烷脱氢速率**：镓位点的内在反应速率，通过TOFGa量化，受镓/铝比例的影响。对于Si/Al比例为15的样品，在不同的镓/铝比例范围内，TOFGa表现出明显的差异行为，表明引入了一种特定类型的镓物种。

4. **催化剂结构-活性关系**：理解镓物种、它们的氢化物形成和PDH活性之间的关系揭示了催化剂结构如何影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。这一理解有助于优化催化剂设计，以提高丙烷转化效率。

这些关系强调了控制镓负载和沸石骨架属性的重要性，以实现丙烷脱氢过程的最佳催化活性。
