Experimental and theoretical assessments of aluminum proximity in MFI zeolites and its alteration by organic and inorganic structure-directing agents were conducted in the study. The focus was on how these factors influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. The relationships revealed insights into the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
