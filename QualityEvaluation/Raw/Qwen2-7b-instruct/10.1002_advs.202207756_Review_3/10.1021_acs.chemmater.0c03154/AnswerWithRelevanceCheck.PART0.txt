          The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. This relationship reveals how these parameters affect the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the Ga/Al ratio impacts the formation and nature of gallium species, while the Si/Al ratio and framework aluminum pair density play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance in such reactions.
