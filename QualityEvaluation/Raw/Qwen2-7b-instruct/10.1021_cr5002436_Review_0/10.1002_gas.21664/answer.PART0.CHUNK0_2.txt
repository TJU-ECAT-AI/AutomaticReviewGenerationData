<quotes>
[1] "COAL-TO-GAS SWITCHING STILL ON THE LIST"
[2] "Last year, with prices dropping so low, generators were abandoning coalas much as they could, given that many had long-term contracts for coaland switching to gas."
[3] "As it was foreseen at the time, subsequently with lower incentives to drill wells, supply decreased, and gas prices rose again."
[4] "Now the analysts say that we should be heading back toward more coal and are even predicting a rally in gas prices."
[5] "We are returning to a more normal situation, with other factors that will steadily affect prices as well."
</quotes>

<quotes>
[1] "Heavy Correlation of Prices to Switching"
[2] "Raymond James analyzed coal basin by coal basin and found that the probable long-term level to prevent switching was about $4.25 a million Btu's."
[3] "Utilities were forced to stay with existing coal contracts regardless of lower natural gas prices."
[4] "As you can clearly see in [Exhibit 1], the coal switching equation is incredibly sensitive and tightly correlated to natural gas pricing."
[5] "Given the high correlation of gas prices to coal to gas switching (95% since 2011), we expect the trend will hold up going forward."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. There is a strong correlation between coal-to-gas switching and natural gas prices, with a sensitivity observed especially around the $4.25 per million Btu threshold. Utilities are bound to their coal contracts, affecting the balance between coal and gas usage. This correlation suggests that as gas prices fluctuate, coal-to-gas switching dynamics will continue to reflect those changes.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
5. 煤炭与天然气之间的转换与天然气价格之间存在很强的相关性，特别是在每百万英制单位4.25美元左右的阈值附近观察到这种敏感性和紧密相关性。公用事业公司被其现有的煤炭合同所束缚，影响着煤炭和天然气使用的平衡。这一相关性表明，随着天然气价格波动，煤炭与天然气转换的动态将继续反映这些变化。

<quotes>
[1] "Price Spike Foreseen"
[2] "Raymond James believes that the market in 2013 is well positioned for sharply higher natural gas prices (and gas to coal switching) this winter."
[3] "Likewise, look for a sharp y/y decrease in switching driven gas-fired generation demand beginning this winter and lasting though the spring."
[4] "At the end of the day, look for gas to coal-fired switching to keep a lid on prices as we move through the second half of 2013."
[5] "On October 11, Morgan Stanley said that it believed that a rally was in process and would continue."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
6. Forecasted price spikes in natural gas are anticipated for the upcoming winter season, with Raymond James suggesting that this will be driven by a significant increase in coal-to-gas switching. Morgan Stanley also confirms the ongoing rally in gas prices, indicating a sustained upward trend.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
6. 预期在未来冬季期间，天然气价格会出现大幅上涨，瑞德福德詹姆斯认为这将由煤炭与天然气转换的显著增加驱动。摩根斯坦利也确认了天然气价格的持续上涨趋势，表明价格将持续上涨。

<quotes>
[1] "THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN"
[2] "Because of all the fuel switching, what was definitely a second- or third-place runner in the natural gas demand pictureuse as a fuel for electricity generationis now definitely the big dog in the room."
[3] "Nevertheless, if Morgan Stanley's theory is correct that in 2013 and beyond, natural gas will retain 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of the 4.2 that it gained, even with higher natural gas prices, then electric generation should still remain the preeminent use of natural gas for the near future."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
7. The dominance of natural gas in electricity generation has dramatically increased due to widespread fuel switching, surpassing its previous status as a secondary player. Morgan Stanley predicts that despite higher prices, natural gas will maintain its primary role in electricity generation for the foreseeable future.
