Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They are used in the production of polyolefins, including polyethylene and polypropylene, and for creating styrene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. In 1998, the United States produced 52 billion pounds of ethylene and 29 billion pounds of propylene. Distillation columns, commonly reaching heights of up to 300 feet, often contain over 200 trays. For the distillation process, a high energy input is required, particularly when the reflux ratio exceeds 10. The development of polymer-inorganic nano composite materials aims to enhance the physical properties of polymer membranes, improving their performance in processes like olefin/paraffin separation.

Starting from detailed reaction mechanisms, a structure is proposed for the corresponding activated complex. The standard entropy of the activated complex is estimated using statistical thermodynamics. The frequency factor is calculated based on the outcomes of transition-state theory. A one-dimensional mathematical reactor model consists of ordinary differential equations that describe changes in composition, temperature, and pressure with respect to the axial position in the reactor. Solving the set of partial differential equations for this model requires substantial computational effort and is typically reserved for specific cases. In the chain mechanism of thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, smaller free radicals like H', CH,', CzH5*, etc., act as chain carriers. Assigning values to the rate constants of individual reactions is the most challenging aspect of constructing a kinetic model. The problem in creating a free-radical kinetic model can be summarized as developing a systematic method for calculating frequency factors and activation energies with a minimum number of parameters to be estimated through regression, without compromising the model's fundamental nature.
