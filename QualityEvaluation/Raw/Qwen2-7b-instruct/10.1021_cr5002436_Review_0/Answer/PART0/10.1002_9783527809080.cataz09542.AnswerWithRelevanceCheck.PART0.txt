          Answer: Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute significantly to the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications and growing market trends. They are used in the production of plastics, solvents, and various other chemical products. The key production methods involve thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis include managing the temperature and pressure levels to optimize yield while considering the length of the alkane chains involved in the reaction.
