          The kinetic modeling of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons employs a free-radical reaction scheme involving numerous reactions. This process typically follows free-radical mechanisms, and constructing a kinetic model requires determining frequency factors and activation energies for each reaction. Transition-state theory simplifies the calculation of frequency factors to calculating the standard entropy of the activated complex. Industrial reactors operate at high temperatures (around 850-900 °C) for the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, which allows the application of transition-state theory. The symmetry number of a molecule is determined by examining its spatial structure, and for reactions with known symmetry numbers, both methods agree.

          热裂解的分子动力学模型采用包含数百个反应的自由基反应方案。该过程通常遵循自由基机制。构建动力学模型需要为每个反应确定频率因子和活化能。根据过渡态理论，频率因子的计算简化为计算激活复合物的标准熵。工业反应器在约850-900 °C的高温下运行，这使得应用过渡态理论成为可能。通过检查分子的空间结构来确定分子的对称数，对于具有已知对称数的反应，两种方法的结果一致。

          Starting from detailed reaction mechanisms, a structure is proposed for the corresponding activated complex. The standard entropy of the activated complex is estimated using statistical thermodynamics. The frequency factor is calculated based on the outcomes of transition-state theory. A one-dimensional mathematical reactor model consists of ordinary differential equations that describe changes in composition, temperature, and pressure with respect to the axial position in the reactor. Solving the set of partial differential equations for this model requires substantial computational effort and is typically reserved for specific cases. In the chain mechanism of thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, smaller free radicals like H', CH,', CzH5*, etc., act as chain carriers. Assigning values to the rate constants of individual reactions is the most challenging aspect of constructing a kinetic model. The problem in creating a free-radical kinetic model can be summarized as developing a systematic method for calculating frequency factors and activation energies with a minimum number of parameters to be estimated through regression, without compromising the model's fundamental nature.
