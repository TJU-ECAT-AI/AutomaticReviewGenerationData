Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry. They are extensively used in the production of polyolefins, including polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as in the creation of styrene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. The key production methods involve processes like steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and dehydrogenation. Thermodynamic challenges are associated with these processes, particularly concerning temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects. Olefin/paraffin separation, a critical process in petrochemical industry, faces challenges due to the high energy demand of traditional separation methods like cryogenic distillation. The use of membrane separation processes provides an energy-efficient alternative. The development of polymer-inorganic nano composite materials aims to enhance the physical properties of polymer membranes, improving both selectivity and permeability. This advancement could significantly boost the utilization of membrane technology in the petrochemical industry, addressing the limitations posed by insufficient gas flux in conventional separation methods.

The kinetic modeling of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons employs a free-radical reaction scheme involving numerous reactions. This process typically follows free-radical mechanisms, and constructing a kinetic model requires determining frequency factors and activation energies for each reaction. Transition-state theory simplifies the calculation of frequency factors to calculating the standard entropy of the activated complex. Industrial reactors operate at high temperatures (around 850-900 °C) for the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, which allows the application of transition-state theory. The symmetry number of a molecule is determined by examining its spatial structure, and for reactions with known symmetry numbers, both methods agree.
