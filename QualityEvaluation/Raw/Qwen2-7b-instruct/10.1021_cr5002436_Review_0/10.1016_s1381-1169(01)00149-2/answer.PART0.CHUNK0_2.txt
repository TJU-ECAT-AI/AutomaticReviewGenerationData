[1] "Membrane reactors applied to catalytic reactions are currently being studied in many places world-wide."
[2] "Palladium as a noble metal with exceptional hydrogen permeation properties and, at the same time, broad applicability as a catalyst, first of all for hydrogenation, is part of many of these developments."
[3] "Dense palladium composite membranes can be used for hydrogen separation from packed-bed catalysts in gas-phase hydro-carbon dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Mesoporous membranes containing dispersed bimetallic Pd/X-clusters can be employed as so-called catalytic diffusers for liquid-phase hydrogenation, e.g. of nitrate and nitrite in water."
