The scientific literature discusses membrane reactors, focusing on those utilizing supported palladium. Palladium, as a noble metal, is highlighted for its hydrogen permeation properties and broad applicability as a catalyst, primarily for hydrogenation processes. It is mentioned that dense palladium composite membranes can be utilized for hydrogen separation in gas-phase hydrocarbon dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, mesoporous membranes containing dispersed bimetallic Pd/X-clusters serve as catalytic diffusers for liquid-phase hydrogenation, specifically for the conversion of nitrate and nitrite in water.

文献讨论了膜反应器，重点是使用支持的钯。钯因其氢渗透性能和作为广泛适用的催化剂的特性而受到关注，主要用于氢化过程。文中提到，密集的钯复合膜可以用于从床层催化剂中分离氢气的气相烃脱氢反应。此外，含有分散的双金属Pd/X簇的介孔膜被用作液相氢化的催化扩散器，例如在水中对硝酸盐和亚硝酸盐的转化。
