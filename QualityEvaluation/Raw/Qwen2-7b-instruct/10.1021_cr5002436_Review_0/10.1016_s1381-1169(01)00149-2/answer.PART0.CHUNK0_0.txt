Membrane reactors are widely studied for catalytic reactions, especially due to palladium's exceptional hydrogen permeation properties and its broad applicability as a catalyst, primarily for hydrogenation. Dense palladium composite membranes are utilized for hydrogen separation from packed-bed catalysts in gas-phase hydrocarbon dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, mesoporous membranes containing dispersed bimetallic Pd/X-clusters serve as catalytic diffusers for liquid-phase hydrogenation, such as the hydrogenation of nitrate and nitrite in water.

膜反应器广泛应用于催化反应的研究，特别是由于钯在氢渗透性和作为广泛适用的催化剂方面的优势，主要应用于氢化。密集的钯复合膜用于从床层催化剂中分离氢气的气相烃类脱氢反应。此外，含有分散的双金属Pd/X簇的介孔膜用作液体相氢化催化剂扩散器，例如水中的硝酸盐和亚硝酸盐的氢化。
