Since there are no relevant quotes regarding light olefins, their applications, market trends, key production methods, and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis, I will provide an answer based on general knowledge and the information provided in the literature.

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications. They serve as building blocks for the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and numerous other chemical products. In terms of market trends, the demand for light olefins is often driven by the growth of sectors such as packaging, automotive, construction, and electronics.

The synthesis of light olefins typically involves various methods, including steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which is widely used in the petrochemical industry. This process takes place under high temperatures and pressures, and the choice of these conditions significantly affects the yield and selectivity of the desired products. Temperature plays a critical role in determining the rate of the reaction and the energy required to break hydrocarbon chains, while pressure influences the reaction kinetics and equilibrium. Longer alkane chains require higher temperatures and pressures to efficiently convert them into light olefins.

Thermodynamic challenges associated with light olefin synthesis include maintaining the optimal balance between reaction rates and product selectivity, ensuring that the process is economically viable, and managing the environmental impact. Advanced catalysts and process technologies continue to be developed to address these challenges, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce energy consumption and emissions.

由于文献中没有与轻烯烃、其应用、市场趋势、关键生产方法以及合成过程中的热力学挑战相关的内容，我将基于一般知识和文献提供的信息进行回答。

轻烯烃，包括丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因其广泛的应用领域。它们用作塑料、合成纤维、溶剂以及其他化学产品的基本原料。在市场趋势方面，轻烯烃的需求往往受到包装、汽车、建筑和电子等产业增长的驱动。

轻烯烃的合成通常涉及多种方法，包括通过高温高压下的烃类蒸汽裂解，这是石油化学行业广泛使用的一种方法。此过程的温度和压力选择对反应速率和所需能量有重大影响，而压力则影响反应动力学和平衡。更长碳链的烷烃需要更高的温度和压力才能有效地转化为轻烯烃。

轻烯烃合成过程中的热力学挑战包括保持反应速率和产品选择性的最佳平衡，确保过程经济可行，并管理环境影响。继续开发先进的催化剂和技术以解决这些挑战，旨在提高效率并降低能耗和排放。
