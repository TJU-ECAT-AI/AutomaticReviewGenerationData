Membrane reactors, especially those utilizing palladium, are extensively studied worldwide due to their potential in catalytic reactions. Palladium, known for its exceptional hydrogen permeation and wide use as a catalyst, particularly in hydrogenation processes, plays a significant role in these developments. These palladium-based membrane reactors can be employed for hydrogen separation from packed-bed catalysts during gas-phase hydrocarbon dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, mesoporous membranes containing dispersed bimetallic Pd/X-clusters can serve as catalytic diffusers for liquid-phase hydrogenation, facilitating the hydrogenation of substances like nitrate and nitrite in water.
