[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."
[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane."
[4] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[5] "Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their versatility and wide range of applications. They are used in the manufacture of plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, detergents, and various other materials. Ethylene, for instance, is the largest single chemical produced worldwide, primarily utilized in the production of polyethylene, which is essential for packaging materials, pipes, and numerous consumer goods. Propylene is another key olefin, often used to produce polypropylene, a material known for its strength, durability, and lightweight properties, widely used in bottles, textiles, and automotive parts.

The synthesis of light olefins involves two primary methods: steam cracking and steam reforming. Steam cracking of ethane yields a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals. This process occurs at high temperatures and requires significant energy input, leading to substantial efficiency losses. On the other hand, steam reforming of light alkanes, especially ethane, is a cost-effective way to produce synthesis gas, which can be further processed to synthesize methanol and high molecular weight linear alkanes. However, steam reforming is energy-intensive and requires high operating pressures and temperatures, which can lead to high capital and operational costs. The overall efficiency of steam reforming is typically around 75% or lower.

These thermodynamic challenges, including the need for high temperatures and pressures, as well as the potential for efficiency loss, highlight the necessity for the development of new process chemistries and engineering systems that can improve the conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical products while minimizing waste and energy consumption.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中扮演着至关重要的角色，因其在多种应用领域的广泛性和灵活性。它们被用于塑料、合成纤维、溶剂、洗涤剂和其他材料的制造。其中，乙烯是全球产量最大的单一化学品，主要用于生产聚乙烯，这是一种用于包装材料、管道等众多消费品的基本材料。丙烯也是关键的烯烃之一，常用于生产聚丙烯，这种材料以其强度、耐用性和轻质特性而闻名，广泛应用于瓶子、纺织品和汽车零件等领域。

轻烯烃的合成主要涉及两种方法：蒸汽裂解和蒸汽重整。蒸汽裂解乙烷产生一种混合物，其中约15%的产品不是高价值化学品。这一过程在高温下进行，并需要大量的能量输入，导致效率损失。另一方面，轻烷烃（尤其是乙烷）的蒸汽重整是一种成本效益高的方式，可以生成合成气，进而进一步加工以合成甲醇和高分子量线性烷烃。然而，蒸汽重整的能量密集型特性要求高操作压力和温度，这可能导致高昂的资本和运营成本。蒸汽重整的整体效率通常在75%或更低。

这些热力学挑战，包括需要高温和高压，以及可能的效率损失，突显出替代石油作为燃料和化学品经济来源的丰富天然气所需的新型化学过程和工程系统发展的必要性，以提高天然气转化为更高价值化学产品的效率，同时减少浪费和能源消耗。

Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their versatile applications in various sectors such as plastics, fibers, and pharmaceuticals. Ethylene and propylene are primarily produced through steam cracking and steam reforming of natural gas. Ethylene can be synthesized with high yields under proper conditions when the feed is ethane. However, steam cracking of ethane results in a mixture of products, with 15% not being valuable chemicals. Steam reforming, while efficient in producing synthesis gas, is costly due to the high pressures and temperatures required (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) and the challenges in heat transfer and coke management.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications and high demand in various sectors, including plastics, pharmaceuticals, and transportation. These products are synthesized through methods like steam cracking and steam reforming. Ethylene, for instance, is produced efficiently when the primary feed is ethane under specific conditions, often yielding high quantities of this essential olefin. Steam reforming, though effective, involves significant costs due to the necessity of high pressures and temperatures (ranging from 15 to 40 atmospheres and 700 to 1000 degrees Celsius), requiring advanced and costly equipment. The thermodynamic challenges associated with these processes include managing heat transfer and dealing with coke buildup, which are critical considerations for enhancing efficiency and reducing operational expenses.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry by serving as building blocks for various applications including plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents. Their synthesis through steam cracking and reforming of light alkanes generates significant amounts of ethylene and propylene, which are then used to produce ammonia, methanol, and high molecular weight linear alkanes. However, the process faces thermodynamic challenges due to the need for high temperatures and pressures, which are costly and require sophisticated reactor designs to manage heat transfer and coke formation. Moreover, steam cracking often results in a mixture of products, with 15% of the output not being high-value chemicals. There is a need for new chemistries that can efficiently convert alkanes into high-value products while minimizing the production of undesired byproducts. Additionally, the direct reaction of water with alkanes is limited by kinetic factors, and there is a requirement for new processes that can operate at lower temperatures and are less sensitive to natural gas impurities to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
