[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "Direct reaction with water is kinetically limited by very short reaction times."
[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane."
[4] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[5] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensitive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their applications in various products, including plastics, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Their synthesis often involves methods like cracking and reforming, which face thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. For instance, cracking ethane yields a mixture with 15% of non-high-value products, while reforming requires high pressures and temperatures in expensive reactors. New chemistries are needed to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中至关重要，因为它们在塑料、溶剂和制药产品等领域的应用。它们的合成通常涉及裂解和重整等方法，面临与温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的热力学挑战。例如，裂解乙烷会产生含有15%非高价值产品的混合物，而重整需要在昂贵的反应器中使用高压和高温。需要新的化学方法来提高效率并减少环境影响。

2. The direct reaction of water with light alkanes is kinetically limited by very short reaction times. Ethylene and propylene can be produced efficiently under specific conditions when ethane is the primary feed. However, steam reforming is costly due to the high pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) required in expensive reactors, posing challenges for heat transfer and coke management.

2. 直接用水与轻烷烃反应的动力学限制由极短的反应时间引起。当乙烷为主要原料时，在特定条件下可以高效生产乙烯和丙烯。然而，蒸汽重整成本高昂，因为需要在昂贵的反应器中使用高压（15至40大气压）和高温（700至1000°C），这给热量传递和焦炭管理带来了挑战。

3. New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensitive to common natural gas impurities are essential for improving upon traditional cracking and reforming methods. These advancements aim to enhance efficiency and broaden the utilization of natural gas as an economical feedstock for fuels and chemicals.

3. 需要新的低温、高产烷烃转化化学方法，这些方法对常见天然气杂质相对不敏感，以改善传统的裂解和重整方法。这些进步旨在提高效率，并扩大天然气作为燃料和化学品经济原料的利用范围。
