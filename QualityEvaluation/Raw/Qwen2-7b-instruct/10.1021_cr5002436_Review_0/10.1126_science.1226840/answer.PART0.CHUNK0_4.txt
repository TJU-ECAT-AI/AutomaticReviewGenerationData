[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."
[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."
[4] "Direct reaction with water is kinetically limited by very short reaction times."
[5] "Reforming of light alkanes accounts for 50% of the world's H2 production used to produce ammonia and other important commodity chemicals."
[6] "Synthesis gas made by reforming natural gas is used to make over 45 billion kg of methanol per year and high molecular weight linear alkanes (3)."
[7] "Steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."
[8] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[9] "Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."
[10] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensitive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."
[11] "The problem is to both activate the strong CH bonds and, under the same conditions, stop short of complete combustion to CO2."
[12] "Direct reaction with water is kinetically limited by very short reaction times."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry by serving as building blocks for various applications including plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents. Their synthesis through steam cracking and reforming of light alkanes generates significant amounts of ethylene and propylene, which are then used to produce ammonia, methanol, and high molecular weight linear alkanes. However, the process faces thermodynamic challenges due to the need for high temperatures and pressures, which are costly and require sophisticated reactor designs to manage heat transfer and coke formation. Moreover, steam cracking often results in a mixture of products, with 15% of the output not being high-value chemicals. There is a need for new chemistries that can efficiently convert alkanes into high-value products while minimizing the production of undesired byproducts. Additionally, the direct reaction of water with alkanes is limited by kinetic factors, and there is a requirement for new processes that can operate at lower temperatures and are less sensitive to natural gas impurities to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中起着至关重要的作用，作为塑料、合成纤维和溶剂等各种应用的基础。通过裂解和重整轻烷烃产生的乙烯和丙烯等合成，为氨、甲醇和高分子量线性烷烃等产品的生产提供了大量原料。然而，该过程面临热力学挑战，由于需要高温和高压，这既昂贵且需要复杂的反应器设计来管理热传递和焦炭形成。此外，蒸汽裂解往往会产生混合物，其中15%的产品不是高质量化学品。需要新的化学方法在保持高效的同时减少副产品的产生，从而将烷烃转化为高质量产品。另外，水直接与烷烃反应受到动力学因素的限制，并且需要新工艺在较低温度下运行，对天然气杂质不敏感以提高效率并减少环境影响。
