[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane."
[3] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications and high demand in various sectors, including plastics, pharmaceuticals, and transportation. These products are synthesized through methods like steam cracking and steam reforming. Ethylene, for instance, is produced efficiently when the primary feed is ethane under specific conditions, often yielding high quantities of this essential olefin. Steam reforming, though effective, involves significant costs due to the necessity of high pressures and temperatures (ranging from 15 to 40 atmospheres and 700 to 1000 degrees Celsius), requiring advanced and costly equipment. The thermodynamic challenges associated with these processes include managing heat transfer and dealing with coke buildup, which are critical considerations for enhancing efficiency and reducing operational expenses.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中起着至关重要的作用，因为它们在多个领域（包括塑料、制药和运输）的需求广泛且高。这些产品通过蒸汽裂解和蒸汽重整等方法合成。例如，当主要原料为乙烷时，可以通过特定条件高效生产乙烯，通常能获得大量这种关键的烯烃。尽管蒸汽重整有效，但其成本高昂，需要高压（15至40大气压）和高温（700至1000摄氏度），并使用昂贵的设备。这些过程的热力学挑战包括管理热量传递以及处理焦炭积累，这是提高效率和降低运营成本的关键考虑因素。
