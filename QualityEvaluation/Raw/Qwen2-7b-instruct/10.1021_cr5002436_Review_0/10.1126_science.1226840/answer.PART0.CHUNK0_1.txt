[1] "Cost-effective conversion of natural gas into higher-value chemical intermediates and liq- uid products could reduce our need for oil and help lower its shipping costs, which are higher than those of petroleum or coal on an energy-delivered basis."
[2] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane."
[3] "Steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."
[4] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[5] "Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their versatile applications in various sectors such as plastics, fibers, and pharmaceuticals. Ethylene and propylene are primarily produced through steam cracking and steam reforming of natural gas. Ethylene can be synthesized with high yields under proper conditions when the feed is ethane. However, steam cracking of ethane results in a mixture of products, with 15% not being valuable chemicals. Steam reforming, while efficient in producing synthesis gas, is costly due to the high pressures and temperatures required (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) and the challenges in heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiency of these processes is generally below 75%.

轻烯烃，如乙烯和丙烯，在化工行业中至关重要，因其在塑料、纤维和制药等多个领域的广泛应用。乙烯和丙烯主要通过天然气的蒸汽裂解和蒸汽重整生产。在适当的条件下，当乙烷作为主要原料时，可以实现乙烯的高产率合成。然而，乙烷蒸汽裂解会产生混合物产品，其中15%不是有价值的化学品。蒸汽重整虽然能够生产合成气，但在高压（15至40大气压）、高温（700至1000°C）和昂贵的反应器中进行，同时面临热传递和焦炭管理的挑战。这些过程的整体效率通常低于75%。
