The Calumet Gas-to-Liquids project, utilizing the Oxford Catalysts technology, is advancing towards front-end engineering, marking it as the sole commercial GTL plant in North America. Upon successful completion, it will be the first GTL plant to operate in North America and the only commercial smaller-scale GTL plant globally. This project, with a planned capacity of around 1400 barrels per day, is poised to significantly impact the chemical industry by providing a new source of liquid fuels and chemicals derived from gas resources. The project is expected to commence operations ahead of Sasol's project in Louisiana and precede other commercial GTL plants worldwide.
