Euro debt crisis; Eurobonds; risk spread; government bonds; ESM.

Introduction: More than two years after the outbreak of the confidence crisis in euro government bond markets the situation remains fragile. Although a whole battery of fiscal and monetary instruments has been created and employed, market panics reappear in waves. The fundamental challenge originates from the asynchronous dynamics of the confidence crisis and reform and consolidation measures.

FIRE - Principles: The FIRE concept is based on the insight that the bad equilibrium in Euro government bond markets creates winners and losers. Issuers with a (relatively) high creditworthiness benefit from historically low refinancing conditions whereas issuers with deteriorating market standings can be confronted with an excess risk spread as a consequence of a deteriorating panic.

FIRE - Advantages: Although the scheme targets at the limitation of the same market phenomenon as Euro- bonds or ECB bond purchases, FIRE is different in numerous important respects: - FIRE does not involve any guarantees on the side of the giving countries. The support would be achieved through a transparent fiscal instrument and would not create any hardly predictable contingent liabilities. Costs would materialize instantly. - The scheme has a natural and politically well defendable financing source: the gains from market panics on the side of the creditworthy countries. These countries only have to transfer back some of these gains. Thus, the FIRE rebalances some of the consolidation requirements between euro area countries in an appropriate way. - This financing source is self-enforcing with an aggravation of market turbulences. It is possible to finance increasing subsidies with intensifying market panics. As long as these panics reduce interest rates of stable countries even further, increased gains allow enlarging subsidies. Consequently, FIRE is inherently credible on the financing side.

FIRE - Quantifications: That FIRE as a mutual financing fund is financially feasible can already be inferred from an inspection of the debt weighted euro area average of government bond yields across the years of the crisis (Figure 2): Whereas a dramatic and fast widening of bond spreads has occurred over the past two years, the debt weighted average of long-term bond yields (10 years maturity) for the euro area has traded around a mean of 4.2 percentage points with low volatility between January 2008 and May 2012. This indicates that the amount of interest rate gains and losses from an increasing differentiation have indeed been symmetric so far. This implies that FIRE's financing assumptions are empirically valid.

Conclusion: Europe has established numerous important institutions such as new fiscal rules or liquidity facilities in its fight against the debt crisis. However, self-fulfilling panics in euro government bond markets can make these reasonable attempts futile. The debate on Eurobonds variants as an allegedly reliable cure does not pay sufficient attention to the dangerous economic and political side effects of that remedy. And the ECB's readiness to intervene in government bond market at "no ex ante quantitative limits" (European Central Bank 2012) raises serious questions on the future of the euro as a stable currency.

A much milder treatment is available and has, so far, been neglected. This is a partial and direct fiscal equalization of interest rates. European leaders would be well advised to prepare new instruments along this line to improve incentives and to limit long-run inflation risks.

The document discusses the Euro debt crisis and the challenges it presents, including the need for stabilization in government bond markets. It introduces the concept of Fiscal Interest Rate Equalization (FIRE) as an alternative solution to Eurobonds and central bank interventions. FIRE aims to stabilize bond markets by addressing the issue of winners and losers created by market panics, offering a transparent fiscal instrument that doesn't involve guarantees and ensures a self-enforcing financing source. The document provides an overview of the principles, advantages, and quantifications of FIRE, emphasizing its potential to improve incentives and limit long-run inflation risks in the Eurozone. The conclusion highlights the importance of considering alternatives like FIRE in addressing the debt crisis, suggesting that it offers a milder yet effective treatment compared to Eurobonds and central bank interventions, which carry significant economic and political side effects.

本文讨论了欧元债务危机及其面临的挑战，包括政府债券市场稳定化的必要性。它引入了财政利率平价（FIRE）作为替代解决方案，与欧元债券和央行干预不同。FIRE旨在通过解决市场恐慌造成的赢家和输家问题来稳定债券市场，提供一个透明的财政工具，不涉及担保，并确保自执行的融资来源。本文概述了FIRE的原则、优势和量化方法，强调了其在改善激励机制和限制长期通货膨胀风险方面的作用。结论指出，在处理债务危机时考虑FIRE等替代方案的重要性，认为与欧元债券和央行干预相比，FIRE提供了更为温和但有效的治疗方式，具有显著的经济和政治副作用。
