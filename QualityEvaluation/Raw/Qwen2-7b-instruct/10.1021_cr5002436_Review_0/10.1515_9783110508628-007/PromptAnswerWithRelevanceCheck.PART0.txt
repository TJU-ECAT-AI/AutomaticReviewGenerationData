[1] "This contribution proposes fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) as an alternative. With FIRE, countries that benefit from low interest rates as a consequence of market panics would transfers some of their savings to subsidize the borrowing of crisis countries within a conditional fiscal scheme."
[2] "The FIRE concept is based on the insight that the bad equilibrium in Euro government bond markets creates winners and losers. Issuers with a (relatively) high creditworthiness benefit from historically low refinancing conditions whereas issuers with deteriorating market standings can be confronted with an excess risk spread as a consequence of a deteriorating panic."
[3] "With FIRE, countries that benefit from low interest rates as a consequence of market panics would transfers some of their savings to subsidize the borrowing of crisis countries within a conditional fiscal scheme."
[4] "The amount of 5.7 bn. EUR for the cost of the FIRE scheme refers to the annual interest rate subsidy for both countries' total emissions in 2012. This subsidy would have to be paid annually over the whole maturity of 2012 emissions."

1. The document proposes fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) as an alternative solution to stabilize bond markets during crises. Countries benefiting from low interest rates due to market panics would transfer some of their savings to subsidize the borrowing of crisis countries through a conditional fiscal scheme.

2. The FIRE concept is grounded in the understanding that in a poor market equilibrium in Euro government bond markets, there are winners and losers. Entities with relatively high creditworthiness benefit from historically low refinancing conditions, while those with declining market positions face excessive risk spreads resulting from deteriorating market panics.

3. In the context of FIRE, countries that benefit from low interest rates due to market panics would transfer some of their savings to assist crisis countries in their borrowing needs within a conditional fiscal framework.

4. The cost of the FIRE scheme for protecting Spain and Italy against interest rates above 5% in 2012 would amount to approximately 5.7 billion EUR annually for their total emissions in that year. This subsidy would have to be paid every year over the entire maturity of the 2012 emissions.

1. 文档提出了财政利息率平等化（FIRE）作为替代方案，以稳定危机期间的债券市场。因市场恐慌而受益于低利率的国家将通过有条件财政计划转移部分储蓄，以补贴危机国家的借款需求。

2. FIRE概念基于理解，在欧元政府债券市场的糟糕均衡中，存在赢家和输家。信用较高的实体能够享受到历史上较低的再融资条件，而市场地位恶化的企业则会面临因市场恐慌加剧而导致的风险溢价。

3. 在FIRE框架下，因市场恐慌而受益于低利率的国家将转移部分储蓄来协助危机国家的借款需求，这需要在有条件财政计划内进行。

4. 为了保护西班牙和意大利在2012年免受利率超过5%的影响，FIRE方案的成本为每年约5.7亿欧元。这相当于这两个国家当年总发行量的年度补贴，且必须每年支付直至2012年发行的全部到期。

[1] "The confidence crisis has immediate destructive consequences: Crisis countries are faced with a sudden rise of refinancing costs which put a large additional burden on their reform and consolidation task."
[2] "In this situation, two solutions are prominent: First, jointly and severally guaranteed Eurobonds; and, second, monetary interventions at the bond markets like the European Central Bank Council has opted for in its decision of September 2012."
[3] "However, possible unintended side-effects are severe. In case of far-reaching mutual guarantees among Eurozone countries major disincentives arise since bond markets would no longer price national bonds on an individual basis."
[4] "FIRE would narrow the spread by (sr+sf) to (c-d). Due to FIRE's budget constraint the subsidy received, sr, and the subsidy financed, sf, must involve identical amounts of resources."
[5] "Thus, the FIRE rebalances some of the consolidation requirements between euro area countries in an appropriate way."
[6] "Since the size of subsidies in the context of FIRE is highly transparent, a full equalization of interest rates would result in a massively increasing immediate fiscal burden for highly rated countries."

1. The confidence crisis in euro government bond markets has immediate destructive impacts, causing crisis countries to face sudden increases in refinancing costs, which significantly strain their reform and consolidation efforts.

2. Two primary solutions are considered for addressing the crisis: joint and several guaranteed Eurobonds and monetary interventions at the bond markets, as exemplified by the European Central Bank's actions in September 2012.

3. Far-reaching mutual guarantees among Eurozone countries introduce major disincentives, as bond markets would no longer evaluate national bonds individually.

4. FIRE (fiscal interest rate equalization) reduces the interest rate spread by (sr+sf), with the received subsidy (sr) and financed subsidy (sf) involving identical resource amounts due to FIRE's budget constraints.

5. FIRE appropriately rebalances some of the consolidation requirements among euro area countries, thanks to the transparency regarding the size of subsidies provided by FIRE.

6. A full equalization of interest rates through FIRE would lead to a substantial and immediate fiscal burden for highly rated countries due to the transparency of the subsidy size.

1. 欧元政府债券市场的信心危机立即产生了破坏性后果：危机国家面临骤增的再融资成本，这在很大程度上加重了它们的改革和整合任务负担。

2. 针对当前状况，有两个突出解决方案：一是联合和连带保证的欧元债券；二是欧洲央行在2012年9月的决策中选择的债券市场货币干预措施。

3. 在欧元区国家之间实施广泛的相互保证会产生重大抵消作用，因为债券市场将不再根据各个国家单独定价。

4. FIRE（财政利息率平价）通过(sr+sf)减少利率差额，其中收到的补贴(sr)和融资的补贴(sf)由于FIRE的预算限制而涉及相同数量的资源。

5. FIRE以透明的方式平衡了欧元区内国家的部分整合需求，这是由于FIRE提供了补贴规模的透明度。

6. 通过FIRE实现全部利息率平等化会导致评级较高的国家面临巨大的即时财政负担，因为补贴规模的透明度是显而易见的。

1. The confidence crisis in euro government bond markets results in a sudden increase in refinancing costs, imposing a heavy burden on reform and consolidation efforts in crisis countries.
2. FIRE suggests that countries benefiting from low interest rates due to market panics should transfer some of their savings to assist crisis countries in their borrowing, within a conditional fiscal framework.
3. For FIRE to effectively stabilize the situation, the support provided (sr) must be sufficient to enable beneficiary countries to achieve sustainable long-term financing under a reform and consolidation pathway.
4. Unlike joint and several Eurobonds, which would equalize interest rates, FIRE maintains differentiation in interest rates while providing assistance to crisis countries.
5. To ensure the availability of FIRE, it should be stipulated that a veto by a single country would not prohibit others from participating in the scheme.
6. Based on the market conditions in May 2012, the annual interest rate subsidy for 2012 emissions for Spain and Italy would be approximately 6 billion EUR.

Jahrbcher f. Nationalkonomie u. Statistik (Lucius & Lucius, Stuttgart 2012) Bd. (Vol.) 232/6 Diskussionsbeitrag / Discussion Paper FIRE for the Euro: A Superior Way to Bond Market Stabilization Friedrich Heinemann* ZEW Mannheim

Euro debt crisis; Eurobonds; risk spread; government bonds; ESM.

Introduction: More than two years after the outbreak of the confidence crisis in euro government bond markets the situation remains fragile. Although a whole battery of fiscal and monetary instruments has been created and employed, market panics reappear in waves. The fundamental challenge originates from the asynchronous dynamics of the confidence crisis and reform and consolidation measures.

FIRE - Principles: The FIRE concept is based on the insight that the bad equilibrium in Euro government bond markets creates winners and losers. Issuers with a (relatively) high creditworthiness benefit from historically low refinancing conditions whereas issuers with deteriorating market standings can be confronted with an excess risk spread as a consequence of a deteriorating panic.

FIRE - Advantages: Although the scheme targets at the limitation of the same market phenomenon as Euro- bonds or ECB bond purchases, FIRE is different in numerous important respects: - FIRE does not involve any guarantees on the side of the giving countries. The support would be achieved through a transparent fiscal instrument and would not create any hardly predictable contingent liabilities. Costs would materialize instantly. - The scheme has a natural and politically well defendable financing source: the gains from market panics on the side of the creditworthy countries. These countries only have to transfer back some of these gains. Thus, the FIRE rebalances some of the consolidation requirements between euro area countries in an appropriate way. - This financing source is self-enforcing with an aggravation of market turbulences. It is possible to finance increasing subsidies with intensifying market panics. As long as these panics reduce interest rates of stable countries even further, increased gains allow enlarging subsidies. Consequently, FIRE is inherently credible on the financing side.

FIRE - Quantifications: That FIRE as a mutual financing fund is financially feasible can already be inferred from an inspection of the debt weighted euro area average of government bond yields across the years of the crisis (Figure 2): Whereas a dramatic and fast widening of bond spreads has occurred over the past two years, the debt weighted average of long-term bond yields (10 years maturity) for the euro area has traded around a mean of 4.2 percentage points with low volatility between January 2008 and May 2012. This indicates that the amount of interest rate gains and losses from an increasing differentiation have indeed been symmetric so far. This implies that FIRE's financing assumptions are empirically valid.

Conclusion: Europe has established numerous important institutions such as new fiscal rules or liquidity facilities in its fight against the debt crisis. However, self-fulfilling panics in euro government bond markets can make these reasonable attempts futile. The debate on Eurobonds variants as an allegedly reliable cure does not pay sufficient attention to the dangerous economic and political side effects of that remedy. And the ECB's readiness to intervene in government bond market at "no ex ante quantitative limits" (European Central Bank 2012) raises serious questions on the future of the euro as a stable currency.

A much milder treatment is available and has, so far, been neglected. This is a partial and direct fiscal equalization of interest rates. European leaders would be well advised to prepare new instruments along this line to improve incentives and to limit long-run inflation risks.

The document discusses the Euro debt crisis and the challenges it presents, including the need for stabilization in government bond markets. It introduces the concept of Fiscal Interest Rate Equalization (FIRE) as an alternative solution to Eurobonds and central bank interventions. FIRE aims to stabilize bond markets by addressing the issue of winners and losers created by market panics, offering a transparent fiscal instrument that doesn't involve guarantees and ensures a self-enforcing financing source. The document provides an overview of the principles, advantages, and quantifications of FIRE, emphasizing its potential to improve incentives and limit long-run inflation risks in the Eurozone. The conclusion highlights the importance of considering alternatives like FIRE in addressing the debt crisis, suggesting that it offers a milder yet effective treatment compared to Eurobonds and central bank interventions, which carry significant economic and political side effects.

The literature outlines the potential for Eurobonds and monetary interventions to stabilize bond markets during the Euro debt crisis. However, it also highlights the risks associated with these solutions, such as the creation of unintended side-effects and the potential for central bank credibility issues. The proposed alternative solution is the establishment of a fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) scheme, which aims to stabilize markets by addressing the issue of differing interest rates among Eurozone countries.

文献阐述了在欧元债务危机期间，欧元债券和货币市场干预可能对债券市场产生稳定作用。然而，它也指出了这些解决方案的潜在副作用风险，包括中央银行信誉问题和政府债务与货币发行之间的危险联系。提出的另一种解决方案是建立财政利率平价（FIRE）计划，该计划旨在通过解决欧元区国家之间不同的利率问题来稳定市场。
