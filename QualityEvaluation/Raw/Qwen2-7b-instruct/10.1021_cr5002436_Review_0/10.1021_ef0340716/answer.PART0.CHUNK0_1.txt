[1] "Dehydrogenation of light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, plays a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their extensive use as building blocks for numerous products. These olefins are essential components in the production of plastics, solvents, lubricants, and fuels. The market trend for light olefins is closely tied to the growth of the global economy and the demand for chemical products. In terms of production methods, light olefins are commonly synthesized through the dehydrogenation of paraffins or the oxidation of ethane or propane. The key challenges associated with their synthesis include the optimization of temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length to achieve high yields and selectivities. These factors significantly influence the economics of the process and the environmental impact."
