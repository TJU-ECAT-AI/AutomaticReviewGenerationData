[1] "Dehydrogenation of light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, plays a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their widespread use in various applications. These include the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and lubricants. The demand for light olefins is driven by the growth in sectors like automotive, packaging, and construction."

[2] "The key production methods for light olefins include steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and gas-to-liquids (GTL) processes. Each method has its own set of thermodynamic challenges, particularly related to the optimal operating temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. For instance, steam cracking typically operates at high temperatures (around 900°C) and pressures (up to 15 bar) to break down heavier hydrocarbons into lighter olefins. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the length of the alkane chains, with shorter chains requiring higher temperatures and pressures for cracking."

[3] "Catalytic cracking utilizes a catalyst to enhance the rate of reaction, making the process more efficient. Catalysts can reduce the temperature and pressure requirements, but they also introduce complexities in terms of the choice of catalyst type and the need for regeneration or replacement over time."

[4] "Gas-to-liquids (GTL) processes convert natural gas into liquid hydrocarbons, including light olefins. This method operates at moderate temperatures (around 500°C) and pressures (up to 200 bar) and is more energy-intensive than steam cracking. The process is favored for its flexibility and environmental benefits."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are essential components in the chemical industry due to their diverse applications in producing plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and lubricants. Their demand is fueled by the expanding sectors like automotive, packaging, and construction. Key production methods include steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and gas-to-liquids (GTL) processes. Steam cracking, typically carried out at high temperatures (around 900°C) and pressures (up to 15 bar), is effective for breaking down heavier hydrocarbons into lighter olefins, with shorter alkane chains requiring higher temperatures and pressures. Catalytic cracking enhances reaction rates through the use of catalysts, which can reduce the temperature and pressure requirements but introduce complexities in catalyst selection and maintenance.

[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes by CO2 to olefins is a promising alternative to dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by oxygen, which suffer from either coking problems or over-oxidation."
[2] "CO2 has also been observed to be an effective oxidant in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4), the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to alkenes, the dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons (methane (CH4), C2H6, and propane (C3H8)) to benzene (C6H6), and the ODH of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."
[3] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources."
[4] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[5] "These reactions include CH4 coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their extensive use in the production of various plastics, synthetic rubbers, solvents, and other materials. Their applications span numerous sectors, including packaging, automotive, construction, and electronics, contributing significantly to the global economy. The key production methods for these olefins involve the dehydrogenation of alkanes, primarily ethane and propane, at high temperatures under pressure. Thermodynamic challenges associated with these processes include the need for high energy inputs to overcome the activation energy barriers, which can lead to the formation of coke, a carbonaceous deposit that reduces catalyst efficiency over time. Additionally, the exothermic nature of the reactions necessitates careful management of heat to prevent over-oxidation, ensuring high selectivity towards olefin formation. CO2, as an oxidant, offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, providing an environmentally friendly approach to olefin synthesis with the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

In the context of CO2 utilization, the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane and ethylene, C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to alkenes, the dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene, and the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene, demonstrate the versatility of CO2 as an oxidant. These reactions not only address the environmental challenge of CO2 emission but also offer a means to enhance the chemical industry's sustainability and efficiency. The development of catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to olefins using CO2 is a critical area of research, aiming to overcome the limitations posed by traditional methods and to unlock the full potential of CO2 as a valuable feedstock.
