[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes by CO2 to olefins is a promising alternative to dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by oxygen, which suffer from either coking problems or over-oxidation."
[2] "CO2 has also been observed to be an effective oxidant in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4), the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to alkenes, the dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons (methane (CH4), C2H6, and propane (C3H8)) to benzene (C6H6), and the ODH of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."
[3] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources."
[4] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[5] "These reactions include CH4 coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their extensive use in the production of various plastics, synthetic rubbers, solvents, and other materials. Their applications span numerous sectors, including packaging, automotive, construction, and electronics, contributing significantly to the global economy. The key production methods for these olefins involve the dehydrogenation of alkanes, primarily ethane and propane, at high temperatures under pressure. Thermodynamic challenges associated with these processes include the need for high energy inputs to overcome the activation energy barriers, which can lead to the formation of coke, a carbonaceous deposit that reduces catalyst efficiency over time. Additionally, the exothermic nature of the reactions necessitates careful management of heat to prevent over-oxidation, ensuring high selectivity towards olefin formation. CO2, as an oxidant, offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, providing an environmentally friendly approach to olefin synthesis with the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

In the context of CO2 utilization, the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane and ethylene, C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to alkenes, the dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene, and the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene, demonstrate the versatility of CO2 as an oxidant. These reactions not only address the environmental challenge of CO2 emission but also offer a means to enhance the chemical industry's sustainability and efficiency. The development of catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to olefins using CO2 is a critical area of research, aiming to overcome the limitations posed by traditional methods and to unlock the full potential of CO2 as a valuable feedstock.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中起着至关重要的作用，因为它们在塑料、合成橡胶、溶剂等产品的生产中的广泛应用。它们的应用涉及包装、汽车、建筑和电子等多个领域，对全球经济产生重大影响。轻烯烃的主要生产方法是烷烃的脱氢化，主要使用乙烷和丙烷，在高压下进行高温操作。这些过程的热力学挑战包括需要高能量输入以克服活化能壁垒，这可能导致焦炭形成，降低催化剂效率。此外，反应的放热性质要求精确管理热量，以防止过氧化，确保高烯烃选择性。二氧化碳作为氧化剂提供了一种有前景的替代方案，提供了环境友好型方法来合成烯烃，并有可能减少温室气体排放。

在二氧化碳利用的背景下，甲烷的氧化耦合生成乙烷和乙烯、C2C4烷烃脱氢生成烯烃、轻烃脱氢化生成苯、以及乙基苯脱氢生成苯乙烯，展示了二氧化碳作为氧化剂的多功能性。这些反应不仅解决了二氧化碳排放的环境挑战，还为提高化学工业的可持续性和效率开辟了可能性。开发能够高效利用二氧化碳转化烷烃为烯烃的催化剂是一个关键的研究领域，旨在克服传统方法的限制，并充分挖掘二氧化碳作为宝贵原料的潜力。
