1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are essential in the chemical industry due to their wide applications in manufacturing polymers and other materials. These compounds are often derived from longer-chain alkanes through dehydrogenation processes.

2. Synthesizing light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges primarily related to the requirement for high temperatures and pressures. These conditions are necessary to drive the reaction forward but can lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts like coke, which negatively impacts the yield and selectivity.

3. Temperature and pressure are pivotal factors in the production of light olefins. Increasing temperatures generally accelerates the reaction rate, yet it also heightens the risk of byproduct formation, necessitating careful control of these parameters to optimize the process.

4. The length of the alkane chain influences the synthesis of light olefins. Longer chains require more energy to undergo dehydrogenation, which affects the overall efficiency and economic viability of the process.

5. Employing carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons represents a promising alternative to conventional methods. This approach could mitigate environmental impacts and provide a sustainable source of feedstock for the production of light olefins.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为这些化合物是制造多种聚合物和其他材料的基石。这些化合物通常从较长链烷烃通过脱氢过程获得。

2. 合成轻烯烃面临的热力学挑战主要与需要高温和高压有关。这些条件对于驱动反应向前发展是必要的，但也会导致不希望的副产品（如焦炭）的形成，从而影响产率和选择性。

3. 温度和压力对轻烯烃的生产至关重要。提高温度通常会加快反应速率，但也增加了副产品的形成风险，因此需要仔细控制这些参数以优化过程。

4. 烷烃链的长度影响轻烯烃的合成。更长的链需要更多的能量进行脱氢，这会影响过程的整体效率和经济性。

5. 将二氧化碳（CO2）用作选择性氧化氢碳化合物的氧化剂代表了一种有前景的替代方法。这种方法有可能减少环境影响并提供一种可持续的原料来源来生产轻烯烃。
