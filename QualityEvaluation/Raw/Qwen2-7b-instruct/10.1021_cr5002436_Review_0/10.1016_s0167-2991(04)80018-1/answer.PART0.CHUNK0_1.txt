[1] "Conversion of natural gas to syn-gas and higher value added products such as methanol, ammonia and transportation fuels is currently being practiced commercially."
[2] "The MTO technology has been extensively demonstrated at a large-scale facility owned by Norsk Hydro in Norway."
[3] "This lends itself to a modified process scheme whereby the heavier olefins are fed to an ATOFINA/UOP Olefin Cracking Process unit (OCP) based on technology developed and demonstrated by ATOFINA and UOP."
[4] "An MTO unit designed to produce 400,000 MTA of polymer-grade ethylene and 400,000 MTA of polymer-grade propylene will also produce about 175,000 MTA of C4+ olefins which, although valuable in an integrated refining or petrochemical complex, may only warrant fuel value in some remote locations."
[5] "Typical IRR rates are in the order of 20% or higher depending on the relative values assigned to the key products."

1. Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, significantly contribute to the chemical industry by serving as essential feedstocks for the production of various downstream products. They are widely used in the manufacturing of polymers, adhesives, solvents, and other chemical intermediates. The demand for these products is expected to grow due to their application in sectors such as packaging, automotive, and construction. Thermodynamic challenges in their synthesis often involve optimizing temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length to achieve high yields while maintaining purity. For instance, decreasing operating severity in the MTO unit shifts the product mix towards more propylene production, which is beneficial for certain applications requiring a high proportion of propylene.
2. The MTO process provides an economically attractive alternative for producing light olefins from methanol or dimethyl ether (DME), which can be derived from natural gas or other hydrocarbon sources at low cost and in large quantities. The process can operate over a broad range of C3/C2 ratios, albeit with slightly lower yields at the extremes of this spectrum. Integrating an MTO unit with an OCP unit increases the carbon-based yield of ethylene plus propylene to nearly 90% of the methanol feedstock, effectively eliminating the need to market less desirable C4+ byproducts. This strategy results in a product slate focused solely on ethylene and propylene with high propylene-to-ethylene ratios, enhancing the economic viability of the process. The IRR rates associated with the MTO/OCP complex can reach 20% or higher, depending on the value assigned to the key products.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中起着至关重要的作用，它们是各种下游产品的重要原料，广泛应用于塑料、胶粘剂、溶剂等化学品的制造。随着包装、汽车和建筑等行业的增长，对这些产品的市场需求预计会增加。合成轻烯烃时，需要解决的热力学挑战包括优化温度、压力和烷烃链长，以实现高产率并保持纯度。例如，降低MTO单元的操作严重性可使产品组合偏向更多丙烯生产，这对于需要较高比例丙烯的应用更为有利。
2. MTO过程提供了一种经济上吸引人的选择，用于从甲醇或二甲醚（可以从天然气或其他碳氢化合物来源低成本大量获取）中生产轻烯烃。该过程可以在较宽的C3/C2比率范围内操作，尽管在这一谱系的极端处产量略低。将MTO单元与OCP单元集成可以将乙烯及丙烯的碳基产率提高到近90%，从而有效避免了将不可喜的C4+副产品进行市场销售。这种方法使得产品组合完全集中在仅乙烯和丙烯上，并具有较高的丙烯/乙烯比，从而提高了过程的经济可行性。与MTO/OCP复合体相关的内部回报率（IRR）可以达到20%或更高，具体取决于关键产品的价值。
