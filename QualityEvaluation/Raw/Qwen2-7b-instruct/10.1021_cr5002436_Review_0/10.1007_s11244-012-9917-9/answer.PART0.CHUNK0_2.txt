1. Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, are crucial in the chemical industry as the largest volume petrochemical intermediates. They are synthesized using a variety of feedstocks ranging from ethane to vacuum gas oil in large steam cracking units. The yield of propylene from most feedstocks is notably low, typically around 13-17 wt%.

2. The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Ethylene and propylene are primarily produced through thermal cracking of ethane, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and heavier feedstocks. The process requires high temperatures and pressures to achieve economically attractive conversion rates. The equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of paraffins increases significantly with the increase in carbon number, indicating that the reaction becomes more endothermic.

3. Lowering the partial pressure of reactants through steam dilution can enhance conversion rates in the dehydrogenation process. This technique is also utilized in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.

4. The cost of separating ethylene from ethane in an ethane-ethylene splitter is generally too high, posing an economic barrier to the process.

5. The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation involves transforming paraffins into corresponding mono-olefins. This process is endothermic and is limited by chemical equilibrium. Higher temperatures and lower pressures are required to achieve higher conversion rates, but these conditions can also accelerate side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

1. 轻烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，是化学工业中最大的中间体，作为最重要的基础化学品。它们通过使用从乙烷到真空气体油等多种原料在大型蒸汽裂解单元中合成。丙烯从大多数原料（如丙烷到气体油）中的产率相对较低，通常约为13%-17%。

2. 轻烯烃的生产面临着与温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的热力学挑战。乙烯和丙烯主要通过裂解乙烷、液化石油气(LPG)和更重的原料来生产。这一过程需要高温和高压才能实现经济上吸引人的转化率。随着碳数的增加，烷基化物脱氢反应的平衡常数显著增加，这意味着反应变得更加吸热。

3. 通过蒸汽稀释降低反应物的分压可以提高脱氢过程的转化率。这一技术也被用于乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯。

4. 分离乙烷中的乙烯的成本通常太高，这构成了一个经济障碍。

5. 催化脱氢的主要反应涉及将烷烃转化为相应的单烯烃。该过程是吸热的，并受到化学平衡的限制。提高温度和降低压力有助于提高转化率，但这些条件也可能加速副反应和催化剂失活。
