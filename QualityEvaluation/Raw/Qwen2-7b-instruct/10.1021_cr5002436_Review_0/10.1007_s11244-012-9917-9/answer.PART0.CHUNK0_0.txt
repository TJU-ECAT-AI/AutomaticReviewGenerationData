[1] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."
[2] "In reality, this is not the case. Heavy paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking. Therefore, in order to maintain a high selectivity and yield it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C and at relatively low per-pass conversions and higher H2 partial pressure."
[3] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."
[4] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."
[5] "Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries also produce significant quantity of propylene byproduct. However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[6] "For example, while the yield of ethylene from ethane cracking is close to 80 wt%, the yield drops to about 30 wt% for a naphtha feedstock."
[7] "Likewise, the yield of propylene is only 1317 wt% of the feed for practically all feedstocks, from propane to gas oil."
[8] "Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity."
[9] "Also, it must be able to produce olefins in high yields over long periods of times without shutdowns and with high operating efficiency."

Light olefins, primarily propylene and ethylene, play a pivotal role in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications and high demand. They are key intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of downstream products, including polymers, solvents, and other specialty chemicals. Their market trends reflect the overall growth in petrochemical sectors, with ethylene and propylene ranking as the top two largest-volume petrochemical intermediates globally.

The primary methods for the production of light olefins include thermal cracking of various feedstocks, such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and heavier hydrocarbons, in the case of ethylene. Thermal cracking also provides a significant byproduct of propylene. Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries further contributes to propylene production.

Despite their importance, the synthesis of light olefins involves thermodynamic challenges related to the balance between yield, selectivity, and energy efficiency. For instance, the production of ethylene from ethane cracking yields approximately 80% weight by weight, whereas this yield drops to about 30% for naphtha feedstock. Similarly, the yield of propylene ranges from 13% to 17% depending on the feedstock type.

To address these challenges, the industry employs selective catalytic dehydrogenation processes for the production of light olefins from light paraffins. These processes aim to maintain reasonable conversion rates while ensuring high olefin selectivity and yields over extended periods without interruptions. The technology is optimized to achieve high operating efficiencies and minimize energy consumption, thereby reducing environmental impact.

In summary, the production of light olefins relies on efficient processes that balance chemical equilibrium, temperature, pressure, and feedstock selection to meet market demands and technological advancements.

轻烯烃，主要为乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中占据核心地位，因其广泛的应用领域和高需求而至关重要。它们是合成一系列下游产品，包括聚合物、溶剂和其他专用化学品的关键中间体。其市场趋势反映了石油化工领域的总体增长，乙烯和丙烯分别位列全球最大的两种大宗化工中间体前两位。

生产轻烯烃的主要方法包括裂解各种原料，例如裂解乙烷、液化石油气（LPG）和较重的碳氢化合物来制取乙烯。裂解过程还提供了大量丙烯的副产品。炼油厂中的流化床催化裂化进一步增加了丙烯的产量。

尽管轻烯烃在化学工业中具有重要意义，但其合成过程中存在热力学挑战，这些挑战涉及到产率、选择性和能效之间的平衡。例如，从乙烷裂解制取乙烯的产率为约80%，而对于石脑油原料，则下降到大约30%。同样，丙烯的产率根据原料类型的不同，在13%至17%之间波动。

为了应对这些挑战，行业采用选择性催化脱氢化工艺从轻烷烃制取轻烯烃。这些工艺旨在保持合理的转化率同时确保高烯烃选择性和产率，并在长时间内持续运行而无需中断。技术优化旨在实现高操作效率并减少能耗，从而降低环境影响。

总之，轻烯烃的生产依赖于高效工艺，通过平衡化学平衡、温度、压力和原料选择，以满足市场需求和技术进步的要求。
