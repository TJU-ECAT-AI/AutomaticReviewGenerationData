[1] "Light olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, are made in very large steam cracking units using a variety of feedstocks that may range from ethane to vacuum gas oil."
[2] "Modern facilities have capacities for up to 1.5 million MTA ethylene using a plurality of furnaces in parallel, each for a capacity of about 200,000 MTA ethylene, at very high severities in excess of 800 C and at high per-pass conversions and at rather low selectivities."
[3] "More significantly, the yield of propylene is only 13-17 wt% of the feed for practically all feedstocks, from propane to gas oil."
[4] "Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity."
[5] "For example, while the yield of ethylene from ethane cracking is close to 80 wt%,the yield drops to about 30 wt% for a naphtha feedstock."
[6] "Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate under vacuum if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected."
[7] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates."

Light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications and growing market demand. They are primarily synthesized through steam cracking processes, which utilize various feedstocks including ethane, propane, and vacuum gas oil. These processes operate at high severities, reaching temperatures exceeding 800°C, and achieve high per-pass conversions. However, the yields of these olefins vary significantly depending on the feedstock. For instance, ethylene yields from ethane cracking are nearly 80%, whereas for naphtha feedstock, the yield drops to about 30%. The production of light olefins through catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires maintaining reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity. Unfortunately, the economics of using the Oleflex process for dehydrogenating ethane to ethylene are not favorable due to the low equilibrium conversion and necessity to operate under vacuum for reasonable ethane conversion. Ethylene and propylene are the largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally, highlighting their importance in the chemical industry.

轻烯烃，如乙烯和丙烯，在化工行业中扮演着至关重要的角色，因为它们在广泛的应用领域中发挥着重要作用，并且市场需求持续增长。它们主要通过蒸汽裂解过程合成，使用各种原料，包括乙烷、丙烷和减压瓦斯油。这些过程在高温下进行，达到超过800°C的严重程度，并实现高一次转化率。然而，不同原料的产量差异显著。例如，从乙烷裂解获得的乙烯产量接近80%，而使用石脑油作为原料时，产量仅为约30%。通过催化脱氢轻烷烃生成轻烯烃需要维持合理的单次转化率和高烯烃选择性。不幸的是，使用Oleflex工艺将乙烷脱氢为乙烯的经济性不佳，由于需要在真空条件下运行以实现合理量的乙烷转化，因此其低平衡转化率是一个障碍。乙烯和丙烯是全球最大的化工中间体，凸显了它们在化工行业中的重要性。
