<quotes>
[1] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."
[2] "In reality, this is not the case. Heavy paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking. Therefore, in order to maintain a high selectivity and yield it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C and at relatively low per-pass conversions and higher H2 partial pressure."
[3] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."
[4] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."
[5] "Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries also produce significant quantity of propylene byproduct. However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[6] "For example, while the yield of ethylene from ethane cracking is close to 80 wt%, the yield drops to about 30 wt% for a naphtha feedstock."
[7] "Likewise, the yield of propylene is only 1317 wt% of the feed for practically all feedstocks, from propane to gas oil."
[8] "Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity."
[9] "Also, it must be able to produce olefins in high yields over long periods of times without shutdowns and with high operating efficiency."

Light olefins, primarily propylene and ethylene, play a pivotal role in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications and high demand. They are key intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of downstream products, including polymers, solvents, and other specialty chemicals. Their market trends reflect the overall growth in petrochemical sectors, with ethylene and propylene ranking as the top two largest-volume petrochemical intermediates globally.

The primary methods for the production of light olefins include thermal cracking of various feedstocks, such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and heavier hydrocarbons, in the case of ethylene. Thermal cracking also provides a significant byproduct of propylene. Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries further contributes to propylene production.

Despite their importance, the synthesis of light olefins involves thermodynamic challenges related to the balance between yield, selectivity, and energy efficiency. For instance, the production of ethylene from ethane cracking yields approximately 80% weight by weight, whereas this yield drops to about 30% for naphtha feedstock. Similarly, the yield of propylene ranges from 13% to 17% depending on the feedstock type.

To address these challenges, the industry employs selective catalytic dehydrogenation processes for the production of light olefins from light paraffins. These processes aim to maintain reasonable conversion rates while ensuring high olefin selectivity and yields over extended periods without interruptions. The technology is optimized to achieve high operating efficiencies and minimize energy consumption, thereby reducing environmental impact.

In summary, the production of light olefins relies on efficient processes that balance chemical equilibrium, temperature, pressure, and feedstock selection to meet market demands and technological advancements.

[1] "Light olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, are made in very large steam cracking units using a variety of feedstocks that may range from ethane to vacuum gas oil."
[2] "Modern facilities have capacities for up to 1.5 million MTA ethylene using a plurality of furnaces in parallel, each for a capacity of about 200,000 MTA ethylene, at very high severities in excess of 800 C and at high per-pass conversions and at rather low selectivities."
[3] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."
[4] "The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethane-ethylene splitter is otherwise too high. Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent [25] for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low-conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene."
[5] "Significant development work has been done on paraffin oxydehydrogenation that would allow selective combustion of hydrogen and thus shift the equilibrium more in favor of higher conversion. This approach was practiced during 1960s for the production of butadiene by Petro-Tex Chemical Corporation and by Phillips Petroleum Com- pany."
[6] "For the production of heavy olefins,selective paraffin dehydrogenation over noble metal cata- lysts has proven to be the preferred and dominant route."
[7] "When only one or two light olefins are desired, in par- ticular propylene or isobutylene or perhaps a mixture of propylene and isobutylene, catalytic dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts has acquired a significant and growing market share."
[8] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, are fundamental components in the chemical industry, primarily serving as building blocks for a wide range of downstream applications such as plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents. Their market trends are closely tied to the growth of industries that rely on these products, such as packaging, automotive, and construction. 

Key production methods involve thermal cracking of various feedstocks, notably ethane, LPG, and vacuum gas oil. Modern facilities capable of producing up to 1.5 million MTA of ethylene utilize multiple furnaces to achieve high severities, exceeding 800°C, and high per-pass conversions, albeit with lower selectivities.

Ethylene is predominantly derived from ethane through thermal cracking processes. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, Dow Chemical has patented a method involving a metal-mordenite catalyst complex that allows for selective recovery of ethylene from a diluted ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene.

Historically, paraffin oxydehydrogenation was practiced for the production of butadiene in the 1960s by Petro-Tex Chemical Corporation and Phillips Petroleum Company. This process allowed for selective combustion of hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversion rates.

For heavy olefins, selective paraffin dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts has been the preferred route. When the focus narrows to the production of specific light olefins, such as propylene or isobutylene, catalytic dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts has gained significant market share, particularly for propylene and isobutylene mixtures.

The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is inherently endothermic and constrained by chemical equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier's principle, achieving higher conversion necessitates either higher temperatures or lower pressures.

轻烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中起着基础作用，主要作为塑料、合成纤维和溶剂等下游应用的构建块。这些产品的市场趋势紧密关联于依赖这些产品的行业增长，如包装、汽车和建筑。

关键生产方法涉及对各种原料的热裂解，尤其是乙烷、液化石油气（LPG）和真空气体油。现代设施能够生产高达150万吨/年的乙烯，利用多个炉子实现超过800°C的高严重性以及高单次通过转化率，尽管选择性较低。

乙烯主要通过热裂解乙烷过程产生。然而，对于乙烷脱氢成乙烯，杜邦化学公司已经获得了一项专利，使用金属莫登石催化剂复合物进行选择性回收乙烯，从稀释的乙烯-乙烷流中通过与苯烷基化来实现。

历史上，1960年代由Petrotex化工公司和菲利普斯石油公司实践的芳烃氧化脱氢过程用于生产丁二烯。这种方法允许选择性燃烧氢，将平衡移向更高的转化率。

对于重烯烃，选择性的芳烃脱氢在贵金属催化剂上已经被证明是首选途径。当目标仅限于特定的轻烯烃，如丙烯或异丁烯，或它们的混合物时，贵金属催化剂上的催化脱氢在丙烯和异丁烯混合物方面获得了显著的市场份额。

轻烷烃的脱氢本质上是吸热的，并且受限于化学平衡。根据勒夏特列原理，要实现更高的转化率，需要更高的温度或更低的压力。

1. Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, are crucial in the chemical industry as the largest volume petrochemical intermediates. They are synthesized using a variety of feedstocks ranging from ethane to vacuum gas oil in large steam cracking units. The yield of propylene from most feedstocks is notably low, typically around 13-17 wt%.

2. The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Ethylene and propylene are primarily produced through thermal cracking of ethane, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and heavier feedstocks. The process requires high temperatures and pressures to achieve economically attractive conversion rates. The equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of paraffins increases significantly with the increase in carbon number, indicating that the reaction becomes more endothermic.

3. Lowering the partial pressure of reactants through steam dilution can enhance conversion rates in the dehydrogenation process. This technique is also utilized in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.

4. The cost of separating ethylene from ethane in an ethane-ethylene splitter is generally too high, posing an economic barrier to the process.

5. The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation involves transforming paraffins into corresponding mono-olefins. This process is endothermic and is limited by chemical equilibrium. Higher temperatures and lower pressures are required to achieve higher conversion rates, but these conditions can also accelerate side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

1. 轻烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，是化学工业中最大的中间体，作为最重要的基础化学品。它们通过使用从乙烷到真空气体油等多种原料在大型蒸汽裂解单元中合成。丙烯从大多数原料（如丙烷到气体油）中的产率相对较低，通常约为13%-17%。

2. 轻烯烃的生产面临着与温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的热力学挑战。乙烯和丙烯主要通过裂解乙烷、液化石油气(LPG)和更重的原料来生产。这一过程需要高温和高压才能实现经济上吸引人的转化率。随着碳数的增加，烷基化物脱氢反应的平衡常数显著增加，这意味着反应变得更加吸热。

3. 通过蒸汽稀释降低反应物的分压可以提高脱氢过程的转化率。这一技术也被用于乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯。

4. 分离乙烷中的乙烯的成本通常太高，这构成了一个经济障碍。

5. 催化脱氢的主要反应涉及将烷烃转化为相应的单烯烃。该过程是吸热的，并受到化学平衡的限制。提高温度和降低压力有助于提高转化率，但这些条件也可能加速副反应和催化剂失活。

Light olefins, specifically ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry as they are fundamental components in various downstream applications. Their synthesis primarily relies on steam cracking units, which utilize a wide array of feedstocks ranging from ethane to vacuum gas oil. The yields of ethylene and propylene vary significantly depending on the feedstock: ethylene yields nearly 80% from ethane, whereas these yields plummet to around 30% for naphtha feedstocks. Similarly, the yield of propylene is only about 13-17% of the feed for most feedstocks, including propane and gas oil. The yield of the C4 product from a steam cracking unit with a light naphtha feed is 81.1%, with approximately half of that being butadiene. Ethylene and propylene are the first and second largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally.

Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, introduced in the early 1970s by UOP, significantly enhanced the stability and activity of noble metal catalysts, enabling their effective utilization in the production of light olefins. This technology is pivotal in maintaining the high productivity and efficiency of these units.
