[1] "Light olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, are made in very large steam cracking units using a variety of feedstocks that may range from ethane to vacuum gas oil."
[2] "Modern facilities have capacities for up to 1.5 million MTA ethylene using a plurality of furnaces in parallel, each for a capacity of about 200,000 MTA ethylene, at very high severities in excess of 800 C and at high per-pass conversions and at rather low selectivities."
[3] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."
[4] "The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethane-ethylene splitter is otherwise too high. Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent [25] for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low-conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene."
[5] "Significant development work has been done on paraffin oxydehydrogenation that would allow selective combustion of hydrogen and thus shift the equilibrium more in favor of higher conversion. This approach was practiced during 1960s for the production of butadiene by Petro-Tex Chemical Corporation and by Phillips Petroleum Com- pany."
[6] "For the production of heavy olefins,selective paraffin dehydrogenation over noble metal cata- lysts has proven to be the preferred and dominant route."
[7] "When only one or two light olefins are desired, in par- ticular propylene or isobutylene or perhaps a mixture of propylene and isobutylene, catalytic dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts has acquired a significant and growing market share."
[8] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, are fundamental components in the chemical industry, primarily serving as building blocks for a wide range of downstream applications such as plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents. Their market trends are closely tied to the growth of industries that rely on these products, such as packaging, automotive, and construction. 

Key production methods involve thermal cracking of various feedstocks, notably ethane, LPG, and vacuum gas oil. Modern facilities capable of producing up to 1.5 million MTA of ethylene utilize multiple furnaces to achieve high severities, exceeding 800°C, and high per-pass conversions, albeit with lower selectivities.

Ethylene is predominantly derived from ethane through thermal cracking processes. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, Dow Chemical has patented a method involving a metal-mordenite catalyst complex that allows for selective recovery of ethylene from a diluted ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene.

Historically, paraffin oxydehydrogenation was practiced for the production of butadiene in the 1960s by Petro-Tex Chemical Corporation and Phillips Petroleum Company. This process allowed for selective combustion of hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversion rates.

For heavy olefins, selective paraffin dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts has been the preferred route. When the focus narrows to the production of specific light olefins, such as propylene or isobutylene, catalytic dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts has gained significant market share, particularly for propylene and isobutylene mixtures.

The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is inherently endothermic and constrained by chemical equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier's principle, achieving higher conversion necessitates either higher temperatures or lower pressures.

轻烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中起着基础作用，主要作为塑料、合成纤维和溶剂等下游应用的构建块。这些产品的市场趋势紧密关联于依赖这些产品的行业增长，如包装、汽车和建筑。

关键生产方法涉及对各种原料的热裂解，尤其是乙烷、液化石油气（LPG）和真空气体油。现代设施能够生产高达150万吨/年的乙烯，利用多个炉子实现超过800°C的高严重性以及高单次通过转化率，尽管选择性较低。

乙烯主要通过热裂解乙烷过程产生。然而，对于乙烷脱氢成乙烯，杜邦化学公司已经获得了一项专利，使用金属莫登石催化剂复合物进行选择性回收乙烯，从稀释的乙烯-乙烷流中通过与苯烷基化来实现。

历史上，1960年代由Petrotex化工公司和菲利普斯石油公司实践的芳烃氧化脱氢过程用于生产丁二烯。这种方法允许选择性燃烧氢，将平衡移向更高的转化率。

对于重烯烃，选择性的芳烃脱氢在贵金属催化剂上已经被证明是首选途径。当目标仅限于特定的轻烯烃，如丙烯或异丁烯，或它们的混合物时，贵金属催化剂上的催化脱氢在丙烯和异丁烯混合物方面获得了显著的市场份额。

轻烷烃的脱氢本质上是吸热的，并且受限于化学平衡。根据勒夏特列原理，要实现更高的转化率，需要更高的温度或更低的压力。
