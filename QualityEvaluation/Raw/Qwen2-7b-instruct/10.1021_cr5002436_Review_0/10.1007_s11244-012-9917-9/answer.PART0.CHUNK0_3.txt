Light olefins, specifically ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry as they are fundamental components in various downstream applications. Their synthesis primarily relies on steam cracking units, which utilize a wide array of feedstocks ranging from ethane to vacuum gas oil. The yields of ethylene and propylene vary significantly depending on the feedstock: ethylene yields nearly 80% from ethane, whereas these yields plummet to around 30% for naphtha feedstocks. Similarly, the yield of propylene is only about 13-17% of the feed for most feedstocks, including propane and gas oil. The yield of the C4 product from a steam cracking unit with a light naphtha feed is 81.1%, with approximately half of that being butadiene. Ethylene and propylene are the first and second largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally.

Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, introduced in the early 1970s by UOP, significantly enhanced the stability and activity of noble metal catalysts, enabling their effective utilization in the production of light olefins. This technology is pivotal in maintaining the high productivity and efficiency of these units.

轻烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色，它们是各种下游应用的基本组成部分。它们的合成主要依赖于蒸汽裂解单元，这些单元使用从乙烷到真空气体油的各种原料。乙烯和丙烯的产率在不同的原料上差异显著：从乙烷中裂解乙烯的产率为近80%，而这些产率对石脑油等原料来说会降至约30%左右。同样，丙烯的产率仅为所有原料（包括丙烷和气体油）中的大约13%-17%。使用轻质石脑油作为原料的蒸汽裂解单元的产率为81.1%，其中大约一半为丁二烯。乙烯和丙烯分别是全球第一和第二大的石油化学品中间体。

20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，极大地提高了贵金属催化剂的稳定性和活性，从而有效利用了这些催化剂生产轻烯烃。这项技术对于确保这些单位的高生产力和效率至关重要。
