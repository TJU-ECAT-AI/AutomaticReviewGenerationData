1. Natural gas liquids, including ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons, are the primary feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities. This is due to the cost advantage provided by the abundance and affordability of natural gas liquids compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha.

2. Chevron Phillips Chemical CEO Peter L. Cella highlighted the economic dynamics that enable the extraction of ethane for the petrochemical industry, benefiting from the lower costs associated with natural gas liquids.

3. Gas exploration companies have reduced drilling activities in response to low natural gas prices, which have led to a surplus of natural gas liquids in the market.

4. A significant drop in oil prices could potentially influence the drilling for natural gas liquids, as it affects the profitability of extracting these resources.

5. The gas industry depends on chemical companies to expand their capacity for natural gas liquids, which are crucial for petrochemical production. The growth in petrochemical demand drives the need for more infrastructure.

6. The oversupply of ethane in the market is a result of increased drilling activities, leading to a glut of natural gas liquids.

7. Ethane prices have significantly decreased from 84 cents per gallon to 54 cents, reflecting the impact of the oversupply on the market.

8. The construction of new ethylene crackers and related facilities is expected to conclude a surge in capacity additions, aiming to capitalize on the favorable market conditions.

9. North American petrochemical firms are planning to add approximately 8.4 million metric tons per year of new ethylene capacity by 2017, representing a 35% expansion of the regional output.

10. Eastman Chemicals' oxo chemicals division has a considerable demand for propylene, which is essential for their manufacturing processes.
