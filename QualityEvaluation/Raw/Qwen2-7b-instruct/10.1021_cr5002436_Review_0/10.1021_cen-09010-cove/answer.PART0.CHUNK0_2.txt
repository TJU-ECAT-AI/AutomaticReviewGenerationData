[1] "Chevron Phillips Chemical CEO Peter L. Cella outlined the economics at play that promise to yield ethane for the petrochemical industry."
[2] "To earn a 10% return on the cost of capital for a new dry gas well, a driller needs natural gas prices of $2.00 to $5.00 per million Btu, he noted. However, for wells focused on natural gas liquids, the 10% return price needed for the natural gas production is actually zero because the driller earns its entire return on the liquids production, which tends to be priced off crude oil, Cella said."
[3] "Low natural gas prices have caused gas exploration companies to cut back on drilling. That might seem like bad news. However, high oil prices ensure that natural gas liquids sell at a healthy premium above natural gas, although at enough of a discount to oil to make them economical chemical raw materials."
[4] "It really shows how much things have changed, where exploration companies actually talk about going after liquids and almost treating the gas as the coproduct."
[5] "The only thing that can meaningfully affect the drilling for gas liquids is if we get a sharp correction in oil prices."
[6] "Ethane oversupply is hitting the market from all this drilling. According to IHS, the U.S. will see more than 400,000 bbl per day of new ethane supply by 2020, a more than 40% increase from today's levels."
[7] "With its success tied to petrochemical makers that buy natural gas liquids, the gas industry needs chemical companies to build more capacity."
[8] "Given their own motivation to boost profits, chemical producers are willing to oblige. But it takes three or four years to build an ethylene cracker."
[9] "Thus, the market will see only incremental capacity additions until 2016."
[10] "These projects will cap an enormous spate of capacity additions. North American firms will add about 8.4 million metric tons per year of new ethylene capacity by 2017, IHS's Stekla says, a 35% expansion of the region's output."

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry due to their diverse applications and market trends. They are typically synthesized through thermal cracking processes at elevated temperatures and pressures. The efficiency of these processes is significantly influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Ethane is often favored in the synthesis of these olefins because of its lower cost compared to naphtha, especially in regions with abundant shale gas resources. This makes the production of ethylene and its derivatives more cost-effective in North America, particularly in the context of the shale boom. As a result, petrochemical companies are increasingly investing in North America, leading to significant capacity expansions for ethylene and related derivatives. The growing supply of ethane has enabled the industry to capitalize on the economic advantages of using natural gas liquids over traditional petroleum-based feedstocks, thereby enhancing profitability and driving innovation within the sector.
