1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications, including use in plastics, solvents, and synthetic fibers. The key production methods involve steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which has been the primary source for over half a century. Thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis often relate to optimizing temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length for maximum efficiency and yield.

2. In the context of modified ZSM-5 zeolites, these materials can significantly enhance the selectivity towards light olefins, producing them in considerable amounts. Various modifications, such as the incorporation of alkali and alkaline earth metals, transition metals, rare earth elements, phosphorus, and adjusting the Si/Al ratio, affect the performance of the catalysts and their ability to crack hydrocarbons efficiently. Factors like zeolite acidity, Si/Al ratio, and temperature play critical roles in determining the yield of light olefins.

3. The mechanisms of catalytic cracking over zeolites involve specific processes influenced by the type of incorporated element. These elements can alter the structure and properties of the zeolite, impacting the cracking process and the formation of light olefins.

4. The review concludes with insights into future prospects, emphasizing ongoing research into improving the performance of modified ZSM-5 zeolites and refining the catalytic cracking process for enhanced light olefin production.
