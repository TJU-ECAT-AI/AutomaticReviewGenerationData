Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their wide applications in manufacturing polymers, solvents, and other chemical products. These olefins are often synthesized through steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which is a process that has been widely used for more than half a century. Recent studies have shown that these light olefins can also be produced in significant quantities over modified ZSM-5 zeolites, which have been extensively reviewed in this paper. The performance of the catalyst, influenced by various promoters like alkali and alkaline earth metals, transition metals, rare earth elements, and phosphorus, is optimized to enhance the selectivity towards light olefins. The production of light olefins is affected by several factors, including the acidity of the zeolite, its Si/Al ratio, and the operating temperature. This review provides insights into how these factors impact the catalytic cracking mechanism and the overall light olefin production process.
