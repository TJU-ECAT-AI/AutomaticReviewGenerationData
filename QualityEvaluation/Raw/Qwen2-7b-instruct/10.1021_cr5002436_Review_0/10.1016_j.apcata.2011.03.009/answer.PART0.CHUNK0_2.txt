The production of light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, is crucial for the chemical industry due to their extensive use in various applications and market trends. These olefins are synthesized primarily through steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which has been the primary method for over half a century. In recent studies, it has been reported that significant amounts of ethylene and propylene can also be produced using modified ZSM-5 zeolites. This review discusses the catalytic cracking of a variety of industrial feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane, over modified ZSM-5 zeolites. The influence of different promoters, including alkali and alkaline earth metals, transition metals, rare earth elements, and phosphorus, on the chemical properties of the modified ZSM-5 and the catalyst's performance in enhancing the selectivity to light olefins is addressed. The role of incorporated elements in the catalytic cracking mechanism is also summarized.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，对化学工业至关重要，因为它们在各种应用和市场趋势中的广泛应用。这些烯烃主要通过蒸汽裂解重质烃类生产，该方法在过去半个世纪一直是主要方法。最近的研究表明，大量丙烯和乙烯也可以使用改性ZSM-5沸石进行生产。本文综述了使用改性ZSM-5沸石对各种工业原料（从重质烃到乙烷）进行催化裂解以产生轻烯烃的方法。讨论了不同促进剂的影响，包括碱金属和碱土金属、过渡金属、稀土元素和磷，这些促进剂对改性ZSM-5的化学性质以及结果催化剂增强轻烯烃选择性的性能的影响。还总结了嵌入元素在催化裂解机制中的作用。
