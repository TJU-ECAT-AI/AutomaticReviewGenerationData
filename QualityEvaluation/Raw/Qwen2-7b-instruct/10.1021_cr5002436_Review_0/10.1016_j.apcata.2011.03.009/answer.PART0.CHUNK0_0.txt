The production of light olefins, primarily ethylene and propylene, has significantly contributed to the chemical industry due to their widespread applications in sectors such as plastics manufacturing, solvents, and petrochemicals. These materials are crucial components in the production of various consumer products and industrial goods. In terms of market trends, the demand for light olefins is expected to grow alongside the expansion of industries that rely on these products. The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges related to the optimal control of temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Temperature plays a critical role in the cracking process, influencing the rate and selectivity of reactions. Pressure affects the efficiency of the process, while the chain length of the alkane feedstock impacts the distribution of olefin products. The incorporation of specific elements into modified ZSM-5 zeolites enhances the catalyst's performance in increasing the selectivity to light olefins, thereby addressing some of these thermodynamic challenges.
