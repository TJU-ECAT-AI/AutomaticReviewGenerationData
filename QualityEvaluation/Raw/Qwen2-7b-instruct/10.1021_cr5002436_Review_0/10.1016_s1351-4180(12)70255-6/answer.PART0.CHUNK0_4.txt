[1] "Sd-Chemie AG, a Clariant Group company, has announced that its breakthrough in CATOFIN propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyst has been successful in delivering a significant increase in propylene selectivity, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption."
[2] "Since the new catalyst was introduced just over a year ago, commercial operations employing the improved catalyst have delivered a 2-3% selectivity boost as well as energy savings of between 5% and 10%, both of which have a significant and very positive impact on plant economics."
[3] "The CATOFIN PDH process is a reliable, proven route for the production of propylene from propane; the process can also be used to produce isobutylenes from isobutane."
[4] "It operates at an optimum reactor pressure and temperature to maximize conversion of propane (or isobutane) with low investment and operating costs."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications, including plastics, polymers, and other chemical products. They are often derived through processes like the catalytic cracking of naphtha and the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons. Key production methods involve high temperatures and pressures, where the thermodynamics of these reactions are critical. Temperature affects the rate and extent of the reaction, while pressure influences the selectivity towards desired products. The length of the alkane chain can also impact the type of olefin produced, with longer chains typically yielding heavier olefins like propylene. The CATOFIN process, highlighted in the literature, demonstrates an efficient method for producing propylene from propane with enhanced selectivity and reduced energy consumption. This process operates at optimal conditions that maximize conversion rates while keeping investment and operational costs low.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色，因为它们在塑料、聚合物和其他化学品中的广泛应用。这些化合物通常是通过催化裂化石脑油和重质烃蒸汽裂解等过程产生的。关键的生产方法涉及高温高压，其中反应的热力学至关重要。温度影响反应速率和程度，而压力则影响选择性，以获得所需的产品。烷基链的长度也可能影响所生产的烯烃类型，通常较长的链产生较重的烯烃，如丙烯。文献中提到的CATOFIN过程展示了从丙烷高效生产丙烯的方法，具有增强的选择性和降低的能量消耗。该过程在最佳条件下运行，最大限度地提高转化率，同时保持投资和运营成本低。
