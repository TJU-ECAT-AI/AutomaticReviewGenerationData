Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications, including plastics, solvents, and petrochemicals. Their market trends often align with global economic growth and demand for consumer goods. The synthesis of these olefins typically involves thermally induced reactions under specific conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures. The thermodynamic challenges associated with their production often relate to achieving optimal conversion rates and selectivities, which can be influenced by factors such as alkane chain length and reaction conditions.

In the context of the provided literature, propylene can be produced from propane using processes like the CATOFIN PDH process. This process is efficient and proven, enabling the conversion of propane into propylene while also producing isobutylenes from isobutane. Similarly, UOP LLC was selected by Sinochem to provide technology for purifying hydrogen at a new refinery in China, which could involve utilizing processes that convert light olefins like propylene into other valuable products, such as isobutylenes.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中至关重要，因其广泛的应用领域，包括塑料、溶剂和石油化学品。它们的市场趋势通常与全球经济增长和消费品需求密切相关。这些烯烃的合成通常涉及在特定条件下进行热诱导反应，如高温和高压。生产过程中的热力学挑战往往与实现最佳转化率和选择性有关，这可能受到烷烃链长和反应条件等因素的影响。

根据提供的文献，丙烯可以通过CATOFIN PDH过程从丙烷中生产出来。该过程高效且已得到验证，能够将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时也能从异丁烷中生成异丁烯。同样，UOP LLC被Sinochem选中提供技术以在中国的一家新炼油厂精制氢气，这可能涉及到将轻烯烃如丙烯转化为其他有价值的产物，如异丁烯的过程。
