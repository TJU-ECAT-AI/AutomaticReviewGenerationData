The dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane and butane, is crucial for the chemical industry due to their role in producing valuable olefinic products like propylene and isobutene. These olefins are essential building blocks for the manufacture of plastics, solvents, and numerous other chemicals. The industrial processes for synthesizing these olefins often involve the use of metal oxide catalysts, such as chromia (chromia/alumina) and vanadia (supported vanadia).

Key production methods for these olefins typically involve high temperatures and pressures. The dehydrogenation reactions are highly exothermic, leading to equilibrium limitations at lower temperatures. Commercial processes aim to achieve high conversion rates, often around 50% per pass, with high selectivities for the desired olefinic products. Selectivity refers to the preference of the catalyst for producing one product over another.

For instance, when converting propane to propene, the selectivity is typically greater than 90%, and for butane to propene, it exceeds 86%. These selectivities are critical for optimizing the yield of the desired products.

Catalyst formulations are carefully engineered to achieve optimal performance. For example, a recent patent describes a catalyst composition with 20% chromium (Cr), 1% zirconium (Zr) as ZrO2, 0.75% magnesium (Mg) as MgO, supported on alumina, and an alkali metal oxide promoter like sodium oxide (Na2O) at 0.75%.

The operation of commercial reactors involves a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. This cyclic operation allows for periodic catalyst regeneration to manage deactivation caused by the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface. The typical operating conditions for these reactors are 0.3–0.5 atmospheres and temperatures ranging from 823 to 923 Kelvin.

In summary, the synthesis of light olefins like propylene and isobutene from alkanes involves sophisticated catalyst design and careful control of reaction conditions to maximize efficiency and product selectivity. The choice of catalyst and operating parameters is critical to achieving high yields and economic viability in the chemical industry.

烷烃如丙烷和丁烷的脱氢对于化学工业至关重要，因为它们是生产重要烯烃（如丙烯和异丁烯）的关键原料。这些烯烃广泛用于塑料、溶剂和其他化学品的制造。工业上合成这些烯烃的过程通常涉及金属氧化物催化剂的使用，如铬氧化物（铬氧化铝）和钒氧化物（支持型钒氧化物）。

关键的生产方法通常包括高温高压操作。脱氢反应是高度放热的，导致在较低温度下的平衡限制。商业过程旨在实现高转化率，通常每批次约50%，同时保持对所需烯烃产品的高选择性。选择性指的是催化剂偏好生产一种产品而不是另一种产品的程度。

例如，在将丙烷转化为丙烯时，选择性通常大于90%，而在将丁烷转化为丙烯时，则超过86%。这些选择性对于优化所需产品的产量至关重要。

催化剂配方经过精心设计以实现最佳性能。例如，一项最近的专利描述了一种由20%的铬（Cr）、1%的锆（Zr）作为ZrO2、0.75%的镁（Mg）作为MgO、支持在氧化铝上的组成，以及钠氧化物（Na2O）作为促进剂，含量为0.75%。

商业反应器的操作涉及一系列固定床反应器，按照循环方式进行操作。这种循环操作允许定期催化剂再生，以管理由于催化剂表面沉积碳质物种而引起的失活。典型的操作条件是0.3至0.5大气压和从823到923开尔文的温度范围。

总之，轻质烯烃（如丙烯和异丁烯）从烷烃合成涉及复杂催化剂设计和精确控制反应条件，以最大化效率和产物选择性。催化剂的选择和操作参数的选择对于实现高产率和经济可行性至关重要。
