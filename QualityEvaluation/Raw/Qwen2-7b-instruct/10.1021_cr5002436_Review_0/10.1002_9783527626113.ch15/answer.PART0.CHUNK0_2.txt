[8] "The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero-propane (C3D8 or [2H]C3H8) over a hydrogen-reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium-reduced (2H2 or D2) catalyst."
[9] "For butane dehydrogenation at 873 K and 14,500 GHSV the product distribution is 70% unreacted butane, 5% trans-2-butene, 6% 1-butene, 4% cis-2-butene, 1.5% butadiene and 1% C1C3."
[10] "Studies using isotopically labeled propane [30] have shown that the route to the coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation goes through a C1 species, probably CH(a)."

1. Chromia catalysts' deactivation occurs due to carbonaceous species deposition on the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The regeneration process involves periodic oxidation.
2. The process chemistry of dehydrogenation is well-reviewed in the literature, notably by Bhasin.
3. Current commercial reactors operate at pressures of 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and temperatures of 823 to 923 Kelvin.
4. The overall operation for butane dehydrogenation includes a conversion rate of approximately 50% per pass, with isobutane to isobutene selectivity exceeding 90% and propane to propene selectivity over 86%.
5. A catalyst formulation for dehydrogenation contains 20% chromium, 1% zirconium as zirconium oxide, 0.75% magnesium as magnesium oxide, supported on alumina with sodium oxide as a promoter at 0.75%.
6. The document summarizes key conclusions from a substantial body of work on the topic without reviewing all publications.
7. After hydrogen reduction, residual hydrogen can be detected by pulsing deutero-propane or propane over hydrogen-reduced and deuterium-reduced catalysts, respectively.
8. The product distribution for butane dehydrogenation at 873 K and 14,500 gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) includes 70% unreacted butane, 5% trans-2-butene, 6% 1-butene, 4% cis-2-butene, 1.5% butadiene, and 1% C1C3.
9. During propane dehydrogenation, the route to coke deposits passes through a C1 species, likely CH(a).
