<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane and butane, is crucial for the chemical industry due to their role in producing valuable olefinic products like propylene and isobutene. These olefins are essential building blocks for the manufacture of plastics, solvents, and numerous other chemicals. The industrial processes for synthesizing these olefins often involve the use of metal oxide catalysts, such as chromia (chromia/alumina) and vanadia (supported vanadia).

Key production methods for these olefins typically involve high temperatures and pressures. The dehydrogenation reactions are highly exothermic, leading to equilibrium limitations at lower temperatures. Commercial processes aim to achieve high conversion rates, often around 50% per pass, with high selectivities for the desired olefinic products. Selectivity refers to the preference of the catalyst for producing one product over another.

For instance, when converting propane to propene, the selectivity is typically greater than 90%, and for butane to propene, it exceeds 86%. These selectivities are critical for optimizing the yield of the desired products.

Catalyst formulations are carefully engineered to achieve optimal performance. For example, a recent patent describes a catalyst composition with 20% chromium (Cr), 1% zirconium (Zr) as ZrO2, 0.75% magnesium (Mg) as MgO, supported on alumina, and an alkali metal oxide promoter like sodium oxide (Na2O) at 0.75%.

The operation of commercial reactors involves a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. This cyclic operation allows for periodic catalyst regeneration to manage deactivation caused by the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface. The typical operating conditions for these reactors are 0.3–0.5 atmospheres and temperatures ranging from 823 to 923 Kelvin.

In summary, the synthesis of light olefins like propylene and isobutene from alkanes involves sophisticated catalyst design and careful control of reaction conditions to maximize efficiency and product selectivity. The choice of catalyst and operating parameters is critical to achieving high yields and economic viability in the chemical industry.

烷烃如丙烷和丁烷的脱氢对于化学工业至关重要，因为它们是生产重要烯烃（如丙烯和异丁烯）的关键原料。这些烯烃广泛用于塑料、溶剂和其他化学品的制造。工业上合成这些烯烃的过程通常涉及金属氧化物催化剂的使用，如铬氧化物（铬氧化铝）和钒氧化物（支持型钒氧化物）。

关键的生产方法通常包括高温高压操作。脱氢反应是高度放热的，导致在较低温度下的平衡限制。商业过程旨在实现高转化率，通常每批次约50%，同时保持对所需烯烃产品的高选择性。选择性指的是催化剂偏好生产一种产品而不是另一种产品的程度。

例如，在将丙烷转化为丙烯时，选择性通常大于90%，而在将丁烷转化为丙烯时，则超过86%。这些选择性对于优化所需产品的产量至关重要。

催化剂配方经过精心设计以实现最佳性能。例如，一项最近的专利描述了一种由20%的铬（Cr）、1%的锆（Zr）作为ZrO2、0.75%的镁（Mg）作为MgO、支持在氧化铝上的组成，以及钠氧化物（Na2O）作为促进剂，含量为0.75%。

商业反应器的操作涉及一系列固定床反应器，按照循环方式进行操作。这种循环操作允许定期催化剂再生，以管理由于催化剂表面沉积碳质物种而引起的失活。典型的操作条件是0.3至0.5大气压和从823到923开尔文的温度范围。

总之，轻质烯烃（如丙烯和异丁烯）从烷烃合成涉及复杂催化剂设计和精确控制反应条件，以最大化效率和产物选择性。催化剂的选择和操作参数的选择对于实现高产率和经济可行性至关重要。

Answer: The deactivation of catalysts used in alkane dehydrogenation processes, such as chromia catalysts, occurs due to the deposition of carbon-based species on the catalyst surface. Regeneration is achieved through oxidation and typically involves periodic steps to restore the catalyst's efficiency. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were employed to dehydrogenate butane into butenes, which were then further processed to create high-octane aviation fuel. Current commercial reactors operate under specific conditions, usually involving pressures of 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and temperatures ranging from 823 to 923 Kelvin. In the dehydrogenation process, a conversion rate of approximately 50% per pass is achieved, with selectivities of over 90% for isobutane to isobutene and greater than 86% for propane to propene. Various analytical techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), have been utilized to characterize catalyst surfaces. Chromium can exist in multiple oxidation states, with (III) and (VI) being the predominant species in an as-prepared catalyst. The active species in the dehydrogenation process is suggested to be Cr(II) by some studies, while others propose a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair as the active site. Butane dehydrogenation shares similarities with propane dehydrogenation, but additional factors like the formation of strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates can influence the catalyst's performance. Different vanadia weight loadings exhibit varying compositions of vanadium oxides, with isolated VOx species dominating at lower densities, coexisting polyvanadates at moderate densities, and V2O5 at higher densities. Reduction of vanadia catalysts occurs across a range of temperatures, with the onset dependent on the loading, reaching completion at 873 K. Studies on vanadia catalysts have shown that the surface area decreases after dehydrogenation, suggesting a transformation in the nature of the support. The structure-function relationship in butane dehydrogenation on vanadia catalysts has been established through combined reactivity, UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM, and UV Raman investigations.

答案：在轻烷烃脱氢过程中，由于碳质物种沉积在催化剂表面导致催化剂失活。再生通常通过氧化实现，并涉及一系列周期性步骤以恢复催化剂效率。在第二次世界大战期间，使用铬氧化铝催化剂将丁烷脱氢成丁烯，然后进一步处理以生成高辛烷值航空燃料。当前商业反应器的操作条件通常包括压力为0.3至0.5大气压和温度从823到923开尔文。在脱氢过程中，每轮转化率约为50%，异丁烷转化为异丁烷的选择性超过90%，丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性大于86%。已使用的分析技术包括X射线粉末衍射（XRD）、紫外可见漫反射光谱（UV-Vis DRS）、拉曼光谱、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、电子自旋共振（EPR）、红外光谱和温度程序化还原（TPR），用于表征催化剂表面。铬可以存在于多种氧化态中，其中III和VI是预先准备的催化剂中的主要物种。脱氢过程中的活性物种由一些研究提出为Cr(II)，而其他研究则建议Cr(II)/Cr(III)对作为活性位点。与丙烷脱氢相比，但烷脱氢具有相似之处，但额外的因素如强吸附反应中间体的存在也可能影响催化剂性能。不同负载量的范德瓦斯催化剂表现出不同的组成，其中孤立的VOx物种在较低密度下占主导地位，共存的聚钒酸盐在中等密度下存在，V2O5在较高密度下形成。范德瓦斯催化剂的还原发生在一系列温度范围内，开始于负载，完全完成于873 K。对范德瓦斯催化剂的研究表明，催化表面面积在脱氢后减小，这表明支持物性质发生了转变。通过结合反应性、紫外可见吸收光谱（UV-Vis DRS）、核磁共振（NMR）、TEOM和紫外光谱（UV）研究，已经建立了但烷脱氢在范德瓦斯催化剂上的结构-功能关系。

1. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been recognized as a catalytic process since the early 1930s. Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and involves oxidation.

2. Typically, commercial reactors operate at 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and temperatures ranging from 823 to 923 Kelvin.

3. In the Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN process, propane is converted to propene over a fixed-bed chromia-alumina catalyst. The process occurs in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis.

4. For propane to propene conversion, the overall operation shows a 50% per pass conversion rate, with a selectivity for isobutane to isobutene exceeding 90% and a selectivity for propane to propene greater than 86%.

5. A catalyst formulation from a recent patent contains 20% chromium, 1% zirconium (ZrO2), 0.75% magnesium (MgO), supported on alumina with a sodium oxide (Na2O) promoter at 0.75%.

6. Cr(VI) was found to be 50% of the chromium present on zirconia. As the loading increases, the surface species change from monochromate to polychromate to α-Cr2O3.

7. Catalysts are typically prepared by impregnation of alumina or zirconia, using chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid, or chromium nitrate.

8. The active species was initially proposed to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and colleagues, though Cr(III) has gained prominence in recent studies.

9. Other researchers have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair. Spectroscopic analyses generally favor Cr(III), but the reduction and re-adsorption/absorption of oxygen indicate that hydrogen reduction reduces Cr2O3 to CrO.

10. The presence of residual hydrogen after chromia catalyst reduction was confirmed by pulsing deutero-propane or propane over hydrogen- or deuterium-reduced catalysts.

11. The rate-determining step for propane dehydrogenation over chromia is the loss of the second hydrogen.

12. For butane dehydrogenation at 873 K and 14,500 GHSV, the product distribution includes 70% unreacted butane, 5% trans-2-butene, 6% 1-butene, 4% cis-2-butene, 1.5% butadiene, and 1% C1C3.

13. Both systems deposit carbon, and under propane dehydrogenation, polynuclear aromatics form.

14. A Raman spectrum from a coked chromia/alumina catalyst is depicted in Figure 15.2.

15. Studies with isotopically labeled propane have shown that the path to coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation involves a C1 species, possibly CH(a).

16. Before converting to coke, these species are labile and can be hydrogenated off the surface as methane.

17. The situation with butane is similar but exhibits significant differences.

18. The majority of catalyst deactivation due to polynuclear aromatics or other coke forms, along with the detection of strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates.

19. These intermediates can be desorbed at room temperature by treating with a low concentration of oxygen in argon mix.
