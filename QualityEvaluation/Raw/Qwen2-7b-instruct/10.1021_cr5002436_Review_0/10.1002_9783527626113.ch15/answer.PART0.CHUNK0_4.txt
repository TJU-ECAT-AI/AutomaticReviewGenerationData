1. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been recognized as a catalytic process since the early 1930s. Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and involves oxidation.

2. Typically, commercial reactors operate at 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and temperatures ranging from 823 to 923 Kelvin.

3. In the Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN process, propane is converted to propene over a fixed-bed chromia-alumina catalyst. The process occurs in a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis.

4. For propane to propene conversion, the overall operation shows a 50% per pass conversion rate, with a selectivity for isobutane to isobutene exceeding 90% and a selectivity for propane to propene greater than 86%.

5. A catalyst formulation from a recent patent contains 20% chromium, 1% zirconium (ZrO2), 0.75% magnesium (MgO), supported on alumina with a sodium oxide (Na2O) promoter at 0.75%.

6. Cr(VI) was found to be 50% of the chromium present on zirconia. As the loading increases, the surface species change from monochromate to polychromate to α-Cr2O3.

7. Catalysts are typically prepared by impregnation of alumina or zirconia, using chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid, or chromium nitrate.

8. The active species was initially proposed to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and colleagues, though Cr(III) has gained prominence in recent studies.

9. Other researchers have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair. Spectroscopic analyses generally favor Cr(III), but the reduction and re-adsorption/absorption of oxygen indicate that hydrogen reduction reduces Cr2O3 to CrO.

10. The presence of residual hydrogen after chromia catalyst reduction was confirmed by pulsing deutero-propane or propane over hydrogen- or deuterium-reduced catalysts.

11. The rate-determining step for propane dehydrogenation over chromia is the loss of the second hydrogen.

12. For butane dehydrogenation at 873 K and 14,500 GHSV, the product distribution includes 70% unreacted butane, 5% trans-2-butene, 6% 1-butene, 4% cis-2-butene, 1.5% butadiene, and 1% C1C3.

13. Both systems deposit carbon, and under propane dehydrogenation, polynuclear aromatics form.

14. A Raman spectrum from a coked chromia/alumina catalyst is depicted in Figure 15.2.

15. Studies with isotopically labeled propane have shown that the path to coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation involves a C1 species, possibly CH(a).

16. Before converting to coke, these species are labile and can be hydrogenated off the surface as methane.

17. The situation with butane is similar but exhibits significant differences.

18. The majority of catalyst deactivation due to polynuclear aromatics or other coke forms, along with the detection of strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates.

19. These intermediates can be desorbed at room temperature by treating with a low concentration of oxygen in argon mix.
