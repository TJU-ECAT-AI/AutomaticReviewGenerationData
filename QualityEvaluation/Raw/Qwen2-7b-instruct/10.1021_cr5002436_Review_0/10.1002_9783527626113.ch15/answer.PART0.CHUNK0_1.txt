[1] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
[2] "Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation."
[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."
[4] "Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and 823 to 923 Kelvin."
[5] "The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%."
[6] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction (TPR)."

[9] "However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair."
[10] "The situation with butane is similar but with significant differences. The formation of coke on the surface is very similar to that found with propane; however, Edussuriya and coworkers (unpublished results) found that although the majority of the catalyst deactivation was due to polynuclear aromatics or other forms of coke strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates were also detected."
[11] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."
[12] "Reduction takes place over a broad range of temperatures and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading with 8% < 3.5% < 1% but reduction is complete for each sample by 873 K."
[13] "In the in situ UV Raman study, V/θ-Al2O3 samples (0.03 V, 1.2 V, 4.4 V, and 14.2 V) that contain surface VOx species with different structures were treated in dilute butane flow at different temperatures and examined by Raman spectra measurements at each temperature."

Answer: The deactivation of catalysts used in alkane dehydrogenation processes, such as chromia catalysts, occurs due to the deposition of carbon-based species on the catalyst surface. Regeneration is achieved through oxidation and typically involves periodic steps to restore the catalyst's efficiency. During World War II, chromia/alumina catalysts were employed to dehydrogenate butane into butenes, which were then further processed to create high-octane aviation fuel. Current commercial reactors operate under specific conditions, usually involving pressures of 0.3 to 0.5 atmospheres and temperatures ranging from 823 to 923 Kelvin. In the dehydrogenation process, a conversion rate of approximately 50% per pass is achieved, with selectivities of over 90% for isobutane to isobutene and greater than 86% for propane to propene. Various analytical techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), have been utilized to characterize catalyst surfaces. Chromium can exist in multiple oxidation states, with (III) and (VI) being the predominant species in an as-prepared catalyst. The active species in the dehydrogenation process is suggested to be Cr(II) by some studies, while others propose a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair as the active site. Butane dehydrogenation shares similarities with propane dehydrogenation, but additional factors like the formation of strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates can influence the catalyst's performance. Different vanadia weight loadings exhibit varying compositions of vanadium oxides, with isolated VOx species dominating at lower densities, coexisting polyvanadates at moderate densities, and V2O5 at higher densities. Reduction of vanadia catalysts occurs across a range of temperatures, with the onset dependent on the loading, reaching completion at 873 K. Studies on vanadia catalysts have shown that the surface area decreases after dehydrogenation, suggesting a transformation in the nature of the support. The structure-function relationship in butane dehydrogenation on vanadia catalysts has been established through combined reactivity, UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM, and UV Raman investigations.

答案：在轻烷烃脱氢过程中，由于碳质物种沉积在催化剂表面导致催化剂失活。再生通常通过氧化实现，并涉及一系列周期性步骤以恢复催化剂效率。在第二次世界大战期间，使用铬氧化铝催化剂将丁烷脱氢成丁烯，然后进一步处理以生成高辛烷值航空燃料。当前商业反应器的操作条件通常包括压力为0.3至0.5大气压和温度从823到923开尔文。在脱氢过程中，每轮转化率约为50%，异丁烷转化为异丁烷的选择性超过90%，丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性大于86%。已使用的分析技术包括X射线粉末衍射（XRD）、紫外可见漫反射光谱（UV-Vis DRS）、拉曼光谱、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、电子自旋共振（EPR）、红外光谱和温度程序化还原（TPR），用于表征催化剂表面。铬可以存在于多种氧化态中，其中III和VI是预先准备的催化剂中的主要物种。脱氢过程中的活性物种由一些研究提出为Cr(II)，而其他研究则建议Cr(II)/Cr(III)对作为活性位点。与丙烷脱氢相比，但烷脱氢具有相似之处，但额外的因素如强吸附反应中间体的存在也可能影响催化剂性能。不同负载量的范德瓦斯催化剂表现出不同的组成，其中孤立的VOx物种在较低密度下占主导地位，共存的聚钒酸盐在中等密度下存在，V2O5在较高密度下形成。范德瓦斯催化剂的还原发生在一系列温度范围内，开始于负载，完全完成于873 K。对范德瓦斯催化剂的研究表明，催化表面面积在脱氢后减小，这表明支持物性质发生了转变。通过结合反应性、紫外可见吸收光谱（UV-Vis DRS）、核磁共振（NMR）、TEOM和紫外光谱（UV）研究，已经建立了但烷脱氢在范德瓦斯催化剂上的结构-功能关系。
