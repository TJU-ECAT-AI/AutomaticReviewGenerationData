[2] "Heterogeneous catalysis is an interdisciplin- ary area that demands the cooperation of scientists from a multitude of different disci- plines. It is based on solid state chemistry and physics, materials chemistry and engineering,surface science, analytical chemistry, theoretical chemistry, reaction kinetics and mechanisms,and reaction engineering."
[3] "The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis aims to describe all facets of the field from the scientific fundamentals to the chemical engineering of industrial processes."
[4] "The present hand- book, published at the verge to the 21. century,is the first comprehensive treatise of hetero- geneous catalysis that attempts do describe all facets of the field from the scientific fundamen- tals to the chemical engineering of industrial processes."
[5] "For a comprehensive treatise of the science of heterogeneous catalysis hence, the cooperation of more than 200 experts from all over the world was required."
[6] "It is our hope that this Handbook of Hetero- geneous Catalysis may promote the further development of the field, that it may stimulate the mutually beneficial cooperation between various relevant disciplines, and that it may attract young scientists to devote their interest to a fascinating, interdisciplinary and future- oriented area."
