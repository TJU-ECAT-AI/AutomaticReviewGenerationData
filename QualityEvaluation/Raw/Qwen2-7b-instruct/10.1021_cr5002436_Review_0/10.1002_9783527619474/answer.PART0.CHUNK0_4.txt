1. Light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications. Their synthesis typically involves cracking hydrocarbons under high temperatures and pressures. The yield and selectivity of olefin production are greatly influenced by these conditions. 
2. As the chain length of the alkane increases, the selectivity towards producing lighter olefins decreases. This highlights the importance of controlling process parameters to achieve desired product distributions.
