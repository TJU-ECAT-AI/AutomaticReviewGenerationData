[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]."
[4] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[5] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[6] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[7] "This implies that while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH,better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[8] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a pivotal role in the chemical industry due to their wide applications in various sectors including petrochemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. The market trend indicates a growing demand for these olefins, particularly for propylene, which is used in the production of polymers, solvents, and other chemical intermediates. Steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation are the main methods used for olefin production, each with its own set of thermodynamic constraints. Steam cracking is favored for ethylene production but faces issues with propylene yield, which lags behind the increasing demand. Dehydrogenation processes, while efficient, face challenges such as coking, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an alternative with potential benefits in energy efficiency and process simplicity. However, to compete with established technologies, ODH processes require catalysts that can produce olefins with yields comparable to current technologies. The use of special reactor configurations or unconventional reaction methods can enhance performance by addressing operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中扮演着至关重要的角色，它们在石油化工、塑料和制药等领域有着广泛的应用。市场趋势显示，对这些烯烃的需求持续增长，特别是对于需求增长更快的丙烯，它被用于聚合物、溶剂和其他化学中间体的生产。蒸汽裂解、流化床催化裂解和催化脱氢是主要的烯烃生产方法，每种方法都有其特定的热力学限制。蒸汽裂解主要用于乙烷生产，但面临着丙烯产量不足的问题，而这一需求正在快速增长。脱氢过程虽然效率高，但也遇到了焦炭生成导致催化剂失活的问题。氧化性脱氢（ODH）提供了一种替代方案，具有潜在的能效优势和工艺简化。然而，为了与现有技术竞争，ODH过程需要催化剂，能够以与当前技术相当的产量生产烯烃。特殊反应器配置或非传统反应方法的使用可以提高性能，通过调整操作参数如温度、压力和烷烃链长效应来解决。
