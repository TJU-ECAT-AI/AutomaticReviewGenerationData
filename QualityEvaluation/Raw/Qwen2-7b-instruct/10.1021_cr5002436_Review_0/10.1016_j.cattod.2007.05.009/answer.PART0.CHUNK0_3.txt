[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[5] "This implies that while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[6] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[7] "Indeed, it is quite difficult to obtain a uniform picture concerning those significant catalyst characteristics that determine the performance in alkane ODH, due to the following reasons:"
[8] "For reasons of brevity, this review does not discuss the literature published on the ODH of alkanes when carried out with oxidants other than O2."
[9] "Nevertheless, sometimes the thorough characterization of the catalyst downloaded post-catalytic tests (the spent catalyst) and the comparison of ante-reaction features may be sufficient to understand whether significant changes in catalyst characteristics occurred during catalytic tests."

The chemical industry benefits significantly from light olefins such as propylene and ethylene, primarily due to their wide range of applications. These olefins are key components in numerous products, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Market trends show a growing demand for olefins, particularly for propylene, which is expected to outpace the demand for ethylene in Western Europe. The production of olefins traditionally relies on processes like steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. However, these methods face thermodynamic limitations and may cause issues like coking, which can rapidly deactivate catalysts. The use of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers an alternative with the potential for improved energy efficiency and process simplicity. This process is exothermic, unlike the endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking, which makes it more energy-efficient and potentially more cost-effective. Despite the potential advantages, the performance of ODH catalysts, specifically their activity in converting alkanes and selectivity towards desired olefin products, is critical to the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes. Current technologies for olefin production already utilize fuel-grade feedstocks, which makes the lower cost of feedstock less of a driving factor for adopting new ODH technologies. Instead, achieving higher olefin yields than those obtained with existing technologies becomes a key consideration for convincing industries to adopt ODH processes. The complexity of catalyst characteristics that influence the performance of ODH processes adds to the challenge of developing economically viable technologies. Notably, research efforts have focused on various aspects, including catalyst morphology, acid-base properties, metal valence states, and electronic properties, among others. These studies aim to optimize catalyst performance in alkane ODH, addressing thermodynamic limitations and enhancing the selectivity towards olefin products. While the literature on ODH has expanded significantly since the early 1990s, discrepancies in experimental conditions and catalyst characterization continue to pose challenges in obtaining a unified understanding of the factors influencing catalyst performance in alkane ODH.

化学工业从轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯中受益巨大，主要由于它们在各种产品中的广泛应用。这些烯烃是塑料、溶剂和燃料等众多产品的关键成分。市场趋势显示，对烯烃的需求，特别是丙烯，在西欧地区预计将超过乙烷的需求。传统上，烯烃生产依赖于蒸汽裂解、流化床催化裂化和催化脱氢等方法。然而，这些方法面临着热力学限制，并可能导致焦炭生成，从而迅速使催化剂失效。氧化脱氢(OHD)提供了另一种替代方案，具有潜在的能源效率改进和过程简化优势。与脱氢和裂化等吸热过程相比，该过程是放热的，使其更节能且可能更具成本效益。尽管如此，ODH催化剂的性能，特别是其在将烷烃转化为烯烃的活性和选择性，对于基于烷烃的化学过程的经济可行性至关重要。当前的烯烃生产技术已经利用了燃料等级的原料，这使得原料成本较低不再是采用新ODH技术的主要动力。相反，与现有技术相比，实现更高的烯烃产率成为说服行业采用ODH过程的关键考虑因素。在烷烃ODH过程中，影响催化剂性能的因素的复杂性增加了开发经济可行技术的挑战。值得注意的是，研究工作已经集中在催化剂形态、酸碱性质、金属价态状态以及电子性质等多个方面，旨在优化烷烃ODH过程的催化剂性能，以应对热力学限制并提高目标烯烃产物的选择性。自1990年代初以来，关于ODH的文献显著增加，但在实验条件和催化剂表征方面的差异继续阻碍获得关于烷烃ODH因素统一理解的挑战。
