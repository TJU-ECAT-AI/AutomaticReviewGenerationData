[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[6] "The potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."
[7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[8] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."

How do light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends, and what are the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects?

Answer: Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are essential components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications. They serve as building blocks for the production of numerous downstream chemicals, plastics, and fuels. Market trends suggest an increasing demand for these olefins, driven by advancements in technology and consumer preferences. Key production methods for olefins include steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis include limitations imposed by temperature and pressure conditions. For instance, dehydrogenation reactions often face thermodynamic constraints that limit alkane conversion. Additionally, the process of coking, where carbon deposits form on the catalyst, can cause rapid deactivation. The effectiveness of the catalyst, considering its activity for alkane conversion and selectivity towards desired products, plays a crucial role in determining the economic attractiveness of alkane-based chemical processes. Companies are hesitant to switch established technologies unless a catalyst can offer a yield superior to current methods, considering the high fixed costs associated with exothermal reactions and the production of CO2, a significant by-product in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has contributed to the discovery of new catalytic systems that address these challenges.
