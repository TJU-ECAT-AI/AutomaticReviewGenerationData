[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]."
[3] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[6] "In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."
[7] "The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."
[8] "A great number of papers deal with the study of the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in propane and ethane ODH."
[9] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[10] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[11] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+ [2225,28,46]."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, playing pivotal roles in the synthesis of numerous petrochemical products, including polymers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The demand for these olefins is anticipated to rise significantly in the near future, driven by expanding applications in various sectors, especially in Western Europe for propylene. The production of olefins faces thermodynamic constraints, leading to limitations in alkane conversion and causing catalyst deactivation issues due to coking.

2. The economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes largely hinges on the catalyst's performance, encompassing its efficiency in converting alkanes and its selectivity towards the desired products. The potential benefits of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are not compelling enough to persuade established industries to adopt new technologies, particularly in the context of well-established, reliable, and efficient plants, unless there is a demonstrable improvement in yield compared to existing methodologies.

3. The use of unconventional oxidants, such as nitrogen dioxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), could potentially revolutionize the field of ODH by generating reactive oxygen species with unique properties or enabling in situ control over the active phase properties of catalysts.

4. Numerous studies have focused on the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane. These catalysts exhibit a positive correlation between vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) loading and catalytic activity in propane ODH, with optimal performance achieved when the active phase size is intermediate.

5. Reactivity data for supported vanadium oxide catalysts in propane and ethane ODH demonstrate consistent kinetic mechanisms, involving the dissociation of CH bonds (in propane) and the Mars-van Krevelen redox process with lattice oxygen for CH bond activation.

6. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium reduction is notably lower than in stoichiometric reductions to vanadium tetra- or trivalent states, and only a fraction of the reduced centers remain active for catalytic turnovers.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，是合成多种石油化工产品（包括聚合物、溶剂和药物）的关键成分。未来几年，对这些烯烃的需求预计会显著增长，特别是在西欧对丙烯的需求增长尤为迅速。烯烃生产受到热力学限制，导致烷烃转化受限，并引发催化剂失活问题，主要由于焦碳积累。

2. 烷烃基化学过程的经济性很大程度上取决于催化剂性能，即其在烷烃转化和目标产物选择性方面的效率。氧化脱氢(OHD)的潜在优势不足以说服已建立的行业放弃现有的成熟、可靠且高效的工厂，除非能够实现当前水平以上的产量提升。

3. 非常规氧化剂，如氮氧化物(N2O)和二氧化碳(CO2)，可能通过生成具有独特活性的氧物种或实现对活性相性质的原位控制，为OHD领域带来重大突破。

4. 大量研究关注了以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂在丙烷和乙烷OHD中的催化特性。这些催化剂在丙烷OHD中表现出与五氧化二钒(V2O5)负载量正相关的催化活性，最佳性能在活性相尺寸中等时获得。

5. 支持型范德华氧化物催化剂在丙烷和乙烷OHD中的反应性数据显示了一致的基元反应机制，涉及CH键的分解（丙烷中的甲基键）和以晶格氧参与的Mars-van Krevelen还原过程来激活CH键。

6. 在稳态OHD过程中，范德华的还原程度远低于到四价或三价状态的定量还原，只有部分还原中心保持活性进行催化周转。
