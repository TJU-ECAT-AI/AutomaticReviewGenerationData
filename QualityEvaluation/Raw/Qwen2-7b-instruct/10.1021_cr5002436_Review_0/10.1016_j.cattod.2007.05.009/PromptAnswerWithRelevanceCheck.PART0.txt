[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "The lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[5] "This implies that while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[6] "The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute significantly to the chemical industry due to their applications in various sectors including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Market trends show a growing demand for these olefins, particularly propylene, which is outpacing the demand for ethylene, especially in Western Europe. Thermodynamic constraints limit the conversion of alkanes into olefins and cause rapid catalyst deactivation, posing challenges to the production process. The effectiveness of the catalyst, measured by its activity and selectivity, is crucial in determining the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes. The lower cost of the feedstock is not a driving factor since current commercial technologies already utilize fuel-grade feedstocks. Achieving higher olefin yields is essential in propylene synthesis by propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to surpass the yields obtained with existing technologies. Using less conventional oxidants like N2O or CO2 could potentially lead to breakthroughs in this field by enabling more controlled and selective reactions.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a pivotal role in the chemical industry due to their wide applications in various sectors including petrochemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. The market trend indicates a growing demand for these olefins, particularly for propylene, which is used in the production of polymers, solvents, and other chemical intermediates. Steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation are the main methods used for olefin production, each with its own set of thermodynamic constraints. Steam cracking is favored for ethylene production but faces issues with propylene yield, which lags behind the increasing demand. Dehydrogenation processes, while efficient, face challenges such as coking, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an alternative with potential benefits in energy efficiency and process simplicity. However, to compete with established technologies, ODH processes require catalysts that can produce olefins with yields comparable to current technologies. The use of special reactor configurations or unconventional reaction methods can enhance performance by addressing operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects.

How do light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends, and what are the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects?

Answer: Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are essential components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications. They serve as building blocks for the production of numerous downstream chemicals, plastics, and fuels. Market trends suggest an increasing demand for these olefins, driven by advancements in technology and consumer preferences. Key production methods for olefins include steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis include limitations imposed by temperature and pressure conditions. For instance, dehydrogenation reactions often face thermodynamic constraints that limit alkane conversion. Additionally, the process of coking, where carbon deposits form on the catalyst, can cause rapid deactivation. The effectiveness of the catalyst, considering its activity for alkane conversion and selectivity towards desired products, plays a crucial role in determining the economic attractiveness of alkane-based chemical processes. Companies are hesitant to switch established technologies unless a catalyst can offer a yield superior to current methods, considering the high fixed costs associated with exothermal reactions and the production of CO2, a significant by-product in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has contributed to the discovery of new catalytic systems that address these challenges.

The chemical industry benefits significantly from light olefins such as propylene and ethylene, primarily due to their wide range of applications. These olefins are key components in numerous products, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Market trends show a growing demand for olefins, particularly for propylene, which is expected to outpace the demand for ethylene in Western Europe. The production of olefins traditionally relies on processes like steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. However, these methods face thermodynamic limitations and may cause issues like coking, which can rapidly deactivate catalysts. The use of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers an alternative with the potential for improved energy efficiency and process simplicity. This process is exothermic, unlike the endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking, which makes it more energy-efficient and potentially more cost-effective. Despite the potential advantages, the performance of ODH catalysts, specifically their activity in converting alkanes and selectivity towards desired olefin products, is critical to the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes. Current technologies for olefin production already utilize fuel-grade feedstocks, which makes the lower cost of feedstock less of a driving factor for adopting new ODH technologies. Instead, achieving higher olefin yields than those obtained with existing technologies becomes a key consideration for convincing industries to adopt ODH processes. The complexity of catalyst characteristics that influence the performance of ODH processes adds to the challenge of developing economically viable technologies. Notably, research efforts have focused on various aspects, including catalyst morphology, acid-base properties, metal valence states, and electronic properties, among others. These studies aim to optimize catalyst performance in alkane ODH, addressing thermodynamic limitations and enhancing the selectivity towards olefin products. While the literature on ODH has expanded significantly since the early 1990s, discrepancies in experimental conditions and catalyst characterization continue to pose challenges in obtaining a unified understanding of the factors influencing catalyst performance in alkane ODH.

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, playing pivotal roles in the synthesis of numerous petrochemical products, including polymers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The demand for these olefins is anticipated to rise significantly in the near future, driven by expanding applications in various sectors, especially in Western Europe for propylene. The production of olefins faces thermodynamic constraints, leading to limitations in alkane conversion and causing catalyst deactivation issues due to coking.

2. The economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes largely hinges on the catalyst's performance, encompassing its efficiency in converting alkanes and its selectivity towards the desired products. The potential benefits of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are not compelling enough to persuade established industries to adopt new technologies, particularly in the context of well-established, reliable, and efficient plants, unless there is a demonstrable improvement in yield compared to existing methodologies.

3. The use of unconventional oxidants, such as nitrogen dioxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), could potentially revolutionize the field of ODH by generating reactive oxygen species with unique properties or enabling in situ control over the active phase properties of catalysts.

4. Numerous studies have focused on the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane. These catalysts exhibit a positive correlation between vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) loading and catalytic activity in propane ODH, with optimal performance achieved when the active phase size is intermediate.

5. Reactivity data for supported vanadium oxide catalysts in propane and ethane ODH demonstrate consistent kinetic mechanisms, involving the dissociation of CH bonds (in propane) and the Mars-van Krevelen redox process with lattice oxygen for CH bond activation.

6. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium reduction is notably lower than in stoichiometric reductions to vanadium tetra- or trivalent states, and only a fraction of the reduced centers remain active for catalytic turnovers.
