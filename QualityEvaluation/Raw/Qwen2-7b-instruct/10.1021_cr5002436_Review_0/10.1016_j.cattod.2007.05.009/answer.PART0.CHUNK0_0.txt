[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "The lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[5] "This implies that while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[6] "The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute significantly to the chemical industry due to their applications in various sectors including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Market trends show a growing demand for these olefins, particularly propylene, which is outpacing the demand for ethylene, especially in Western Europe. Thermodynamic constraints limit the conversion of alkanes into olefins and cause rapid catalyst deactivation, posing challenges to the production process. The effectiveness of the catalyst, measured by its activity and selectivity, is crucial in determining the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes. The lower cost of the feedstock is not a driving factor since current commercial technologies already utilize fuel-grade feedstocks. Achieving higher olefin yields is essential in propylene synthesis by propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to surpass the yields obtained with existing technologies. Using less conventional oxidants like N2O or CO2 could potentially lead to breakthroughs in this field by enabling more controlled and selective reactions.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，对化学工业有重大贡献，因其在塑料、溶剂和燃料等领域的应用。市场趋势显示，这些烯烃的需求增长显著，尤其是丙烯，其需求增速超过乙烷，特别是在西欧地区。热力学限制了烷烃转化为烯烃的过程，并导致催化剂快速失活，为生产过程带来挑战。催化剂的有效性，通过其转化率和选择性的衡量，决定了烷基化化学过程的经济可行性。虽然原料成本较低不是推动因素，因为当前商业技术已经使用了燃料级原料，但在丙烯通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）合成过程中，需要获得比现有技术更高的烯烃产率来超越现有技术的产率。使用N2O或CO2等不太常规的氧化剂可能在此领域带来突破，通过生成具有特定对烃反应性的特殊氧物种，或者实现对活性相性质的原位控制。

2. The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties.
