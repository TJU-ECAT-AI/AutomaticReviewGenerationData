<questions>
How do light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends, and what are the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects?
</questions>

The provided scientific literature does not directly address the questions regarding the contributions of light olefins to the chemical industry, their market trends, key production methods, or thermodynamic challenges related to their synthesis. The focus of the literature is on a specific reaction mechanism—propane oxidative dehydrogenation using a novel fluidizable catalyst—and its kinetic modeling. Therefore, the literature does not contain relevant information to answer these questions in detail.

Answer:
This scientific literature primarily focuses on the propane oxidative dehydrogenation process, which is one method for producing light olefins like propylene. It discusses the use of a novel fluidizable catalyst to enhance the selectivity of the process and employs kinetic modeling to optimize reaction conditions. However, it does not provide comprehensive insights into the broader applications, market trends, production methods, or thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects.

Chinese Answer:
这篇科学文献主要关注丙烷氧化脱氢过程，这是生产轻烯烃如丙烯的一种方法。它讨论了使用新型流化催化剂来提高反应选择性的应用，并通过动力学建模来优化反应条件。然而，它没有提供关于轻烯烃合成的广泛应用、市场趋势、生产方法或与温度、压力和烷烃链长效应相关的热力学挑战的全面见解。
