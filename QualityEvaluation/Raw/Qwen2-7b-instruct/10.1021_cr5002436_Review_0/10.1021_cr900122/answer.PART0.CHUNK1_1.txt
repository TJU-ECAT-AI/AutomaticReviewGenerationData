[1] "Light olefins such as propylene and ethylene play crucial roles in the chemical industry, serving as feedstocks for the production of numerous petrochemical products."
[2] "The key production methods involve steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil, which requires high temperatures and pressures to break down the hydrocarbons into lighter olefins."
[3] "Thermodynamic challenges related to temperature and pressure are significant in the synthesis of light olefins. Higher temperatures promote cracking reactions, while pressure affects the selectivity of the produced olefins."

1.Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are essential components in the chemical industry due to their widespread use in manufacturing various petrochemical products. Steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil is the primary method used for their production, which necessitates high operating temperatures and pressures to facilitate the breaking down of hydrocarbons into lighter olefins. Thermodynamic considerations, particularly the influence of temperature and pressure, pose significant challenges in the synthesis process. Elevated temperatures enhance the effectiveness of cracking reactions, whereas pressure impacts the selectivity of the resulting olefin products.
