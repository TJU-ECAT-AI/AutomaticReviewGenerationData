1. The direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products is a significant area of research driven by the need to optimize resources and reduce the number of steps required. The key step often relies on selective CH bond activation.

2. Finding stable catalytic systems that can operate under acceptable conditions remains a challenge in the field.

3. In heterogeneous catalysis, processes that enable the selective activation of CH bonds in alkanes are crucial for the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step.

4. Various mechanisms and intermediates are involved in the selective CH bond activation process.

5. It is proposed that alkanes can react in similar ways with certain sites, potentially converting into alkenes.

6. The activity in H/D exchange reactions of oxides is not related to their Lewis acidity or basicity.

7. CH bond activation of alkyl fragments can occur during the chemisorption of organometallic compounds on alumina through grafting.

8. Grafting typically takes place via reactions involving the surface hydroxyls with the reactive MC bond. However, in the case of MeReO3, grafting can occur via coordination of the oxo ligand on Lewis acid sites or CH bond activation of the methyl group on defect sites.

9. Other supports such as nobia, silicaalumina, and zeolite can activate CH3ReO3, suggesting that similar active species might form on these supports through CH bond activation of the methyl group on reactive MOS sites.

10. CH bond activation processes yielding μ-methylidene surface species can explain the formation of minor species in the chemisorption of Cp2M(CH3)2 on highly dehydroxylated alumina for metals like uranium (U) and thorium (Th).
