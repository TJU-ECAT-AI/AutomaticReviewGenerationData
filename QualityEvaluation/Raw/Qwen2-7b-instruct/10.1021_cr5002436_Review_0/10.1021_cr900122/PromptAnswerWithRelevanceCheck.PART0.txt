[1] "The selective activation and transformation of alkanes or aromatics have been a research goal for several decades."
[2] "Today, research in this area is strongly motivated by the need to optimize resources and to shorten the number of steps, hence the direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products is therefore of major interest."
[3] "In heterogeneous catalysis, several large scale industrial processes are based on the selective CH bond activation of alkanes and lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step."
[4] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years."
[5] "Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."
[6] "In the case of methane, CH bond activation occurs on AlIII sites, the most unsaturated and reactive Al sites, and generates surface AlSOH and AlIVCH3 species (Scheme 2)."
[7] "Similarly to CH4, H2 reacts with the same AlIIIO sites but also with the less reactive AlIVO sites."
[8] "The most likely mechanism for propane dehydrogenation into propene on Ga2O3 takes place via H-transfer on O sites and a concomitant reduction of surface Ga-centers."
[9] "Metal-alkyl intermediates have been observed (87) but could only correspond to dormant species of the overall catalytic cycle."
[10] "The thus-generated alkyl radical generates via H-transfer the alkene and GaIIIH."
[11] "Note that the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3 (compared to those of Al2O3 and SiO2 for instance) could be related to the ease of formation of reduced surface species, i.e. GaI."
[12] "While the dehydrogenation of alkanes on Ga2O3 is promising, rapid deactivation is still a major problem."
[13] "Improved stabilities have been obtained by using solid solution in alumina (83) or by using supported systems."
[14] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades."
[15] "Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane → acrylic acid, butane → maleic anhydride, xylene → phtalic anhydride..."
[16] "The conversion of propane into acrylic (eq 4) and of 2-methylpropane into methacrylic acid (eq 5) have been studied in detail with similar types of catalysts: VPO, bismuth-molybdate catalysts, and multicompenent oxide catalysts, e.g. MoVTe(Sb)."
[17] "While Malkyl intermediates might be formed at lower temperatures, (120) the key step of this reaction is a H-abstraction, the formation of radical intermediates, and subsequent gas phase reactions."
[18] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."
[19] "Independently of the catalysts and the reactions, the CH bond activation is often the rate determining step."
[20] "However, despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment (Scheme 9a)."
[21] "The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, (138, 139) to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species."
[22] "Therefore, research efforts have concentrated on finding more stable catalysts using different supports (SiO2, ZrO2, ...) (106) or on using promoters such as CO2, which can displace the equilibrium and slow down coke formation for silica supported systems."
[23] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol (Scheme 14)."
[24] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d)."
[25] "It is noteworthy that bulk metal halides and, in particular, LaCl3 catalyze several processes involving CH bond activation: for instance, the selective transformation of methane into chloromethane (Scheme 8) (125) and the hydrogenchlorine exchange between chlorinated hydrocarbons; for example, CHCl3 and CHCl3 are transformed into 2CH2Cl2 (eq 7)."
[26] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (232) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations."
[27] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature."
[28] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d)."
[29] "This system displays a similar reactivity to zirconium hydrides, i.e. the low temperature activation of alkanes and H/D exchange reactions, through very likely the same mechanism, σ-bond metathesis (Scheme 15c and d, M = Ta)."
[30] "Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."
[31] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c)."
[32] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[33] "Overall, the current best reported catalysts are based on alumina or silicaalumina supported tungsten hydrides."
[34] "Despite the transfer of two carbons in place of one, as usually observed previously, this selectively can be explained using the same mechanism and the same alkylidene hydride intermediates (Scheme 29b)."
[35] "This shows that both Csp3 and Csp2 can be involved in the alkane metathesis process."

[1] "Today, research in this area is strongly motivated by the need to optimize resources and to shorten the number of steps, hence the direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products is therefore of major interest."
[2] "Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective CH bond activation."
[3] "However, finding stable catalytic systems using acceptable operating conditions remains a challenge."
[4] "In heterogeneous catalysis, several large scale industrial processes are based on the selective CH bond activation of alkanes and lead to the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step."

[8] "Finally, the CH bond activation of alkyl fragments can also occur during the chemisorption of organometallic compounds on alumina (grafting)."
[9] "While grafting typically takes place via reaction of the surface hydroxyls with the reactive MC bond, in the particular case of MeReO3, it was shown that grafting occurred via either coordination of the oxo ligand on Lewis acid sites or CH bond activation of the methyl group on defect sites."
[10] "It is noteworthy that other supports such as nobia, silicaalumina, and zeolite can be used to activate CH3ReO3, and one could propose that similar active species are formed on these supports via CH bond activation of the methyl group on reactive MOS sites."
[11] "Finally, CH bond activation processes yielding μ-methylidene surface species have also been proposed to explain the formation of minor species in the chemisorption of Cp2M(CH3)2 on highly dehydroxylated alumina (Scheme 3c, M = U and Th)."
