[1] "Light olefins such as propylene and ethylene are crucial components of the chemical industry, contributing to the production of numerous downstream products, including plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and fuels."
[2] "These light olefins are primarily synthesized through steam cracking of hydrocarbons at high temperatures and pressures, which involves the thermal breakdown of longer alkane chains into shorter olefinic products."
[3] "Temperature and pressure play significant roles in steam cracking processes, with higher temperatures and pressures facilitating the cracking reactions, but also increasing the risk of thermal degradation of the feedstock and the formation of unwanted byproducts."
[4] "The length of the alkane chain in the feedstock directly affects the distribution of olefinic products. Longer chain alkanes require higher temperatures and pressures to effectively break down into olefins, whereas shorter chain alkanes undergo cracking at lower conditions."

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are fundamental to the chemical industry due to their extensive use in producing various downstream products. These olefins are typically synthesized through steam cracking of hydrocarbons at elevated temperatures and pressures. Higher temperatures and pressures are conducive to the cracking reactions, although they also increase the risk of feedstock degradation and the formation of undesired byproducts. The length of the alkane chain in the feedstock influences the cracking process, requiring higher temperatures and pressures for longer chain alkanes to effectively break down into olefins, whereas shorter chain alkanes undergo cracking under lower conditions.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们广泛用于生产各种下游产品。这些烯烃通常通过在较高温度和压力下对烃类蒸汽裂解合成。更高的温度和压力有利于裂解反应，但也增加了原料降解的风险以及副产品的形成。烷烃链的长度影响裂解过程，需要更高的温度和压力将较长链烷烃有效地分解成烯烃，而较短链烷烃则在较低条件下进行裂解。
