[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components of the chemical industry due to their widespread use in various applications, including plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and fuels. The demand for these materials is growing globally, driven by the increasing consumption of consumer goods and industrial applications."
[2] "The synthesis of light olefins is typically achieved through processes like steam cracking of naphtha or other hydrocarbons, which involves high temperatures and pressures to break down the feedstock into shorter-chain hydrocarbons. This process faces thermodynamic challenges, especially with regard to maintaining efficiency at high temperatures and pressures to maximize the yield of desired products."
[3] "Temperature and pressure play significant roles in the synthesis of light olefins. Higher temperatures generally increase the reaction rate, promoting the breaking of hydrocarbon chains, but can also lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. Optimal conditions require a balance to maximize the formation of light olefins while minimizing the formation of heavier hydrocarbons and cracking products."
[4] "Pressure is another critical factor. Increased pressure accelerates the reaction rate by bringing reactants closer together, which can enhance the yield of light olefins. However, excessively high pressures can also lead to increased viscosity of the feedstock, potentially hindering efficient mixing and heat transfer, which are detrimental to the reaction kinetics."
[5] "The chain length of the alkane feedstock also influences the synthesis of light olefins. Longer-chain alkanes require higher temperatures and pressures to effectively crack into lighter olefins. This necessitates careful selection of operating conditions to ensure the process remains thermodynamically feasible and economically viable."

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are indispensable to the chemical industry due to their extensive use in products like plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and fuels. Their demand is expanding worldwide, fueled by rising consumption of consumer goods and industrial applications. Synthesis primarily occurs through steam cracking of naphtha or other hydrocarbons, which demands high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges arise, particularly in balancing efficiency at high temperatures and pressures to maximize light olefin production while minimizing byproducts. Temperature and pressure significantly impact the process: higher temperatures boost reaction rates but may yield unwanted products, while increased pressure accelerates reactions by enhancing mixing and heat transfer but can increase feedstock viscosity, hindering efficiency. The chain length of the alkane feedstock further influences synthesis, necessitating careful condition selection for economic viability.
