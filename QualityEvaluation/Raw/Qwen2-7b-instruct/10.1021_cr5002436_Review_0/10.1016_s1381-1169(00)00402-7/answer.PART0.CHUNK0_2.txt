[1] "The principles of De Donder can be applied to a general reaction scheme of elementary steps for ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt to identify a set of kinetic coefficients that explain the observed reaction kinetics."
[2] "Values for the fitted parameters were determined using Athena Visual Workbench [28]. This software employs a general regression analysis of the reaction kinetics data with the reactor treated as a continuous stirred-tank reactor."
[3] "The kinetic analyses predict that the surface should be largely covered with atomic hydrogen (fractional coverage of 0.55)."
[4] "The results from DFT calculations and the kinetic analyses agree that CC bond cleavage takes place through C2Hx species that are more hydrogenated than the most abundant C2Hx species on the surface."
