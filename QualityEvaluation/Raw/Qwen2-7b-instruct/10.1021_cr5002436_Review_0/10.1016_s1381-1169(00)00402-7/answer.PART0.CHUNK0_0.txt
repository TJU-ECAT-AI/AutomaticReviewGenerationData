[3] "The results of our DFT calculations predict that the primary pathways for CC bond cleavage involve activated complexes that are more highly hydrogenated (e.g. adsorbed CHCH3 and C2H5 species) compared to the most abundant surface intermediates (e.g. adsorbed CCH3)."

The kinetic models consolidate findings from first principles calculations and reaction kinetics studies to elucidate the surface chemistry in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum catalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that adsorbed species and transition states bind more strongly to the Pt(2 1 1) surface compared to the Pt(1 1 1) surface, aligning with the structural sensitivity of ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum catalysts. The primary pathways for carbon-carbon bond cleavage are predicted to involve activated complexes that are more hydrogenated (such as CHCH3 and C2H5 species) than the most abundant surface intermediates (like CCH3). The kinetic analyses confirm that CC bond cleavage occurs through C2Hx species that are more hydrogenated than the most prevalent C2Hx species on the surface.

建立的动力学模型综合了从第一原理计算和反应动力学研究获得的结果，以阐明铂催化剂上乙烷氢解的表面化学。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，吸附物种和过渡态在Pt(2 1 1)表面上的结合力比在Pt(1 1 1)表面上更强，这与铂催化剂上乙烷氢解的结构敏感性相一致。碳碳键断裂的主要途径预计涉及比最丰富的表面中间体（如CCH3）更氢化的活化复合物（例如CHCH3和C2H5物种）。动力学分析证实，CC键断裂发生在比表面最常见C2Hx物种更氢化的C2Hx物种上。
