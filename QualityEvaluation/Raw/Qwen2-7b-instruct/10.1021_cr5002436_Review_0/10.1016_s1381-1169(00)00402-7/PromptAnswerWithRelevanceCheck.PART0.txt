The kinetic models consolidate findings from first principles calculations and reaction kinetics studies to elucidate the surface chemistry in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum catalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that adsorbed species and transition states bind more strongly to the Pt(2 1 1) surface compared to the Pt(1 1 1) surface, aligning with the structural sensitivity of ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum catalysts. The primary pathways for carbon-carbon bond cleavage are predicted to involve activated complexes that are more hydrogenated (such as CHCH3 and C2H5 species) than the most abundant surface intermediates (like CCH3). The kinetic analyses confirm that CC bond cleavage occurs through C2Hx species that are more hydrogenated than the most prevalent C2Hx species on the surface.

Ethane hydrogenolysis involves the conversion of ethane into lighter hydrocarbons using a platinum catalyst. The process occurs through surface chemistry on the catalyst, as described by kinetic models that combine results from first principles calculations and reaction kinetics studies. According to these models, the most abundant surface species during ethane hydrogenolysis are adsorbed atomic hydrogen and highly dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species, like ethylidyne. The primary pathways for cleaving the carbon-carbon (CC) bond on the platinum surface involve transition states that are more hydrogenated, such as C2H5 and CHCH3 species. These transition states interact more strongly with the step edges of the Pt(2 1 1) surface compared to the Pt(1 1 1) surface, reflecting the structure sensitivity of the reaction. The overall reaction rate is described by a series of lumped reaction steps, including the formation of stable C2Hx adsorbed species and transition states from ethane and dihydrogen gas phases.

Ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum involves the formation of stable adsorbed species and transition states from gaseous ethane and dihydrogen. Kinetic coefficients for these processes are derived using De Donder principles. These coefficients are influenced by the standard entropy and enthalpy changes of the adsorbed species and transition states, which are predicted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations of their interactions with platinum surfaces.

<p>Accordingly, the reactive species that are responsible for CC bond cleavage are not necessarily the most abundant surface intermediates that can be observed spectroscopically. However, these most abundant surface intermediates still play an important role in the reaction kinetics by determining the frac- tion of the surface that is available for catalytic reac- tion (i.e. they participate in site blocking).</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reactive species responsible for cleaving the CC bond are not always the most abundant surface intermediates visible via spectroscopy. Yet, these most prevalent surface intermediates still hold significance in reaction kinetics. They influence the proportion of the surface accessible for catalytic reactions (participating in site blocking).

<p>The primary difference between the values of the final kinetic parameters used in the model and the initial values obtained from DFT calculations was that the fitted enthalpy changes for the formation of C2Hx transition states involved in cleavage of the CC bond were lower than the initial values predicted from DFT calculations. This difference may be explained by the structure sensi- tivity of the system and/or the inherent error of the DFT calculations.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main discrepancy between the final kinetic parameter values used in the model and the initial DFT-calculated values lies in the enthalpy changes for forming C2Hx transition states during CC bond cleavage. These changes were lower in the model than initially predicted by DFT. This could be due to the system's structural sensitivity or inherent DFT calculation errors.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
模型中使用的最终动力学参数值与初始从DFT计算得到的值之间的主要差异在于形成C2Hx过渡态时的CC键断裂过程中所涉及的焓变。这些变化在模型中低于初始由DFT预测的值。这可能是由于系统的结构敏感性或DFT计算固有的误差。
