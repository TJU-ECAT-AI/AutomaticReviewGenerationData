<p>The principles of De Donder can be applied to a general reaction scheme of elementary steps for ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt to identify a set of kinetic coefficients that explain the observed reaction kinetics. These kinetic coefficients are expressed in terms of lumped reaction steps involving the formation of stable adsorbed species and transition states from gaseous ethane and dihydrogen. Values for the stan- dard entropy and enthalpy changes for these steps are predicted from DFT calculations of the interactions of the appropriate species with Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(2 1 1) slabs.</p>

Ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum involves the formation of stable adsorbed species and transition states from gaseous ethane and dihydrogen. Kinetic coefficients for these processes are derived using De Donder principles. These coefficients are influenced by the standard entropy and enthalpy changes of the adsorbed species and transition states, which are predicted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations of their interactions with platinum surfaces.

<p>Accordingly, the reactive species that are responsible for CC bond cleavage are not necessarily the most abundant surface intermediates that can be observed spectroscopically. However, these most abundant surface intermediates still play an important role in the reaction kinetics by determining the frac- tion of the surface that is available for catalytic reac- tion (i.e. they participate in site blocking).</p>

The reactive species responsible for cleaving the CC bond are not always the most abundant surface intermediates visible via spectroscopy. Yet, these most prevalent surface intermediates still hold significance in reaction kinetics. They influence the proportion of the surface accessible for catalytic reactions (participating in site blocking).

负责切断CC键的活性物种不一定是通过光谱观测到的最丰富的表面中间体。然而，这些最丰富的表面中间体在反应动力学中仍然扮演着重要角色，决定了可用于催化反应的表面比例（参与位点阻塞）。

<p>The primary difference between the values of the final kinetic parameters used in the model and the initial values obtained from DFT calculations was that the fitted enthalpy changes for the formation of C2Hx transition states involved in cleavage of the CC bond were lower than the initial values predicted from DFT calculations. This difference may be explained by the structure sensi- tivity of the system and/or the inherent error of the DFT calculations.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main discrepancy between the final kinetic parameter values used in the model and the initial DFT-calculated values lies in the enthalpy changes for forming C2Hx transition states during CC bond cleavage. These changes were lower in the model than initially predicted by DFT. This could be due to the system's structural sensitivity or inherent DFT calculation errors.

模型中使用的最终动力学参数值与初始从DFT计算得到的值之间的主要差异在于形成C2Hx过渡态时的CC键断裂过程中所涉及的焓变。这些变化在模型中低于初始由DFT预测的值。这可能是由于系统的结构敏感性或DFT计算固有的误差。
