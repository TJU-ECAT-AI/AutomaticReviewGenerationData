[1] "Kinetic models are formulated to describe the essential surface chemistry involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum catalysts, through consolidation of results obtained from first principles calculations and reaction kinetics studies."
[2] "Results from DFT calculations and kinetic analyses suggest that the most abundant surface species during ethane hydrogenolysis are adsorbed atomic hydrogen and highly dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species (e.g. ethylidyne species),whereas the primary reaction pathways for cleavage of the CC bond on Pt take place through transition states that are more highly hydrogenated (e.g. C2H5 and CHCH3 species)."
[3] "The results from DFT calculations indicate that C2Hx adsorbed species and transition states interact more strongly with Pt(2 1 1) than with Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, in agreement with the known structure sensitivity of ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt catalysts."
[4] "De Donder analyses of a general reaction scheme for ethane hydrogenolysis indicate that the rate of the overall reaction can be described in terms of a series of lumped reaction steps involving the formation of stable C2Hx adsorbed species and transition states from gas-phase ethane and dihydrogen."

Ethane hydrogenolysis involves the conversion of ethane into lighter hydrocarbons using a platinum catalyst. The process occurs through surface chemistry on the catalyst, as described by kinetic models that combine results from first principles calculations and reaction kinetics studies. According to these models, the most abundant surface species during ethane hydrogenolysis are adsorbed atomic hydrogen and highly dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species, like ethylidyne. The primary pathways for cleaving the carbon-carbon (CC) bond on the platinum surface involve transition states that are more hydrogenated, such as C2H5 and CHCH3 species. These transition states interact more strongly with the step edges of the Pt(2 1 1) surface compared to the Pt(1 1 1) surface, reflecting the structure sensitivity of the reaction. The overall reaction rate is described by a series of lumped reaction steps, including the formation of stable C2Hx adsorbed species and transition states from ethane and dihydrogen gas phases.

乙烷氢化涉及使用铂催化剂将乙烷转化为更轻的烃类。该过程通过催化剂表面的化学反应进行，由结合第一原理计算和反应动力学研究结果的动力学模型描述。根据这些模型，乙烷氢化过程中最丰富的表面物种是吸附的原子氢和高度脱氢的碳氢化合物物种，如乙炔。CC键在铂表面上的主要裂解途径涉及更富含氢的过渡态，如C2H5和CHCH3物种。这些过渡态与Pt(2 1 1)表面的台阶边缘相比，与Pt(1 1 1)表面的相互作用更强，反映出反应的结构敏感性。总体反应速率通过一系列合并步骤描述，包括从乙烷和二氢气体形成稳定的C2Hx吸附物种和过渡状态。
