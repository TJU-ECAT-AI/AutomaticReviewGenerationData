[1] "Studies of chemical kinetics of catalytic processes, thus, typ- ically involve analyses of reaction schemes, with the aim of describing the rate of the overall reaction in terms of contributions from individual elementary steps."
[2] "While in the most general case it is desirable to determine pre-exponential factors and activation energies for each of these elementary steps, there is usually not sufficient information to extract the values of all kinetic parameters."
[3] "This increasing availability of energetic and entropic information obtained from theoretical and experimental studies is invaluable in kinetic analyses to minimize the information-deficit and to help determine which of the kinetic parameters are important in controlling catalyst performance."
[4] "Without a means to account for the key differences between the catalyst systems, it is not possible to take advantage of the similarities that these systems may possess."
[5] "In this paper, the combined results from experimental and theoretical investigations are con- solidated with the aim of interpreting the observed reaction kinetics data for ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum."
[6] "Our pre- vious work has shown that the activation barrier for a fifth possible route for CC bond cleavage involving adsorbed CCH2 species is considerably higher than the barriers for the other four routes, and hence, we do not include that route."
[7] "Note that isomerization steps 5 and 6 may, in fact, involve hydrogenation-dehydrogenation steps, i.e. CHCH32 may be formed by dehydrogena- tion of CH2CH22 to form CHCH23, followed by hydrogenation of CHCH23 to from CHCH32."
[8] "We note that the definition of the reversibility, zi, is simply a transform of the affinity, Ai, in the De Donder re- lation for step i."
[9] "Accordingly, z4 and z6 are equal to one."
[10] "These coefficients Cieq correspond to equilibrium coefficients for the following overall reactions: Lumped reactions that control surface coverages,θC2Hx, and θH:"
[11] "Finally, it is assumed for simplicity that mono-carbon species CHxare rapidly converted to methane, mak- ing steps 710 irreversible."
[12] "In this reaction scheme,we allow for the possibility that the most abundant adsorbed C2Hx surface species is not necessarily the primary species that undergoes CC bond cleavage."
[13] "The results from our DFT calculations predict that the primary pathways for CC bond cleavage involve ac- tivated complexes that are more highly hydrogenated (e.g. adsorbed CHCH3 and C2H5 species) compared to the most abundant surface intermediates (e.g. adsorbed CCH3)."
[14] "The results of our DFT calculations predict that the primary pathways for CC bond cleavage may take place through activated complexes that are more highly hydrogenated (e.g. C2H5 and CHCH3) compared to the most abundant surface intermediates (e.g. CCH3)."

1. Chemical kinetics of catalytic processes typically involve analyzing reaction schemes to describe the rate of the overall reaction in terms of contributions from individual elementary steps.

2. Determining all kinetic parameters for each elementary step is often not feasible due to insufficient information.

3. Theoretical and experimental studies provide valuable energetic and entropic information that helps in minimizing the information deficit in kinetic analyses and determining significant kinetic parameters.

4. Without accounting for key differences between catalyst systems, it's difficult to exploit similarities between them.

5. The paper consolidates experimental and theoretical results to interpret ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum kinetics.

6. The activation barrier for a fifth CC bond cleavage route involving CCH2 species is notably higher than others, hence it's excluded.

7. Isomerization steps 5 and 6 might involve hydrogenation-dehydrogenation processes.

8. The reversibility, zi, is defined as a transformation of the affinity, Ai, in the De Donder relation.

9. Steps 4 and 6 have a reversibility value of one.

10. Lumped coefficients, Ci and Cieq, represent equilibrium coefficients for various overall reactions controlling surface coverages and θH.

11. Mono-carbon species CHx are assumed to rapidly convert to methane, making steps 7-10 irreversible.

12. The most abundant adsorbed C2Hx species might not always undergo CC bond cleavage.

13. The primary CC bond cleavage pathways involve activated complexes that are more hydrogenated compared to the most abundant surface intermediates.

14. The primary CC bond cleavage pathways involve activated complexes that are more hydrogenated (e.g. CHCH3 and C2H5) than the most abundant surface intermediates (e.g. CCH3).
