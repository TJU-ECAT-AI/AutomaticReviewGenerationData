[1] "Veins commonly exhibit microstructures that are indicative of the crack-seal mechanism [9], where a crack repeatedly opens and is subsequently sealed again by mineral growth (Figure 1)."
[2] "This crack-sealing, which can be repeated thousands of times in a single vein, indicates that fluid flow is not continuous, but intermittent: fluid pressure builds up to exceed the tensional strength of the rock and cause failure, after which flow can occur until the fracture permeability is sealed offagain [913]."
[3] "The estimated amount of fluid to have produced this breccia is about 20 km3."
[4] "Weisheit et al. [4] describe a hydraulic breccia, the Hidden Valley Breccia, Australia, that is 10 km2 in outcrop and contains clasts that range from <0.1 mm to >100 m in size."
[5] "The large range is mostly due to uncertainty in the fracture toughness of rocks."
[6] "Miller and Nur [21] developed a crustal scale cellular automaton model which was able to capture the general dynamics of large scale hydraulic fracture networks, but wasnt based on realistic concepts for fluid propagation and closing of fractures."
[7] "The basic law governing laminar fluid flow q over a distance L through porous media is Darcys law:"
[8] "In all experiments the fractured area increases until the fracture network is efficient enough to create equilibrium between fluid production at the basal fluid source and fluid drainage at the surface."
[9] "Results for a viscosity mode (ν = 1017 Pa s) are displayed in Figure 6."
[10] "If basal fluid overpressure is sufficiently large (starting already at Po 0.8 MPa, due to the noise on the tensile strength), hydraulic fractures form and drain the fluid produced at the basal fluid source toward the surface."
[11] "The reason is the increase of the fluid pressure along the fluid pathways (Figure 7, right). This permanent increase, coupled with flow enabled by the background permeability of the material,leads occasionally to fracturing even if the fluid source is in a distance."
[12] "The evolution of the fracture pattern for a particular simulation (with 0.9 MPa overpressure/ν = 1017) is shown in Figure 12."
