<p>Veins commonly exhibit microstructures that are indicative of the crack-seal mechanism [9], where a crack repeatedly opens and is subsequently sealed again by mineral growth (Figure 1).</p>
<p>This crack-sealing, which can be repeated thousands of times in a single vein, indicates that fluid flow is not continuous, but intermittent: fluid pressure builds up to exceed the tensional strength of the rock and cause failure, after which flow can occur until the fracture permeability is sealed offagain [913].</p>
<p>Hydraulic breccias also typically show indications of repeated fracturing in the form of clasts in clasts and brecciated cement [4, 14].</p>
<p>The estimated amount of fluid to have produced this breccia is about 20 km3.</p>
<p>Intermittent flow is predicted to occur when the matrix permeability of a rock is insufficient to accommodate fluid flow [21, 22].</p>
<p>A number of numerical models for hydrofracture formation exist already [30, 31] while new models are continuously developed [e.g., 3236].</p>
<p>The current interest in these models is mainly triggered by the enormous economic importance of artificial hydraulic (aka fracking) as a means of oil and gas extraction.</p>
<p>Under these conditions the criterion for failure is simply: Peff> Pcr,(4)</p>
<p>Conductivity increases linearly with the fluid overpressure at the source layer until it reaches a constant maximum, starting at an overpressure of approx. 1 MPa (Figure 13), which is also the mean tensile strength of the material.</p>
<p>These areas of heightened fluid pressure from potential future pathways for hydraulic fractures and quick fluid transport.</p>
<p>The reason is a valve function of the interface between fluid source and matrix rocks, where fluid pressure builds up by Darcian flow until it is sufficient to initiate fracture formation and quick removal of fluid mass toward the surface.</p>
<p>The fracture dynamics follows a 1/f α pattern, with 1 < α < 2.</p>
<p>If fractures heal slowly, the fracture network is stable and fluid flow is nearly constant.</p>
<p>While the dynamics of fluid flow and fracture formation differs considerably between the two settings, the efficiency of the fluid transport is not affected.</p>

The literature discusses the occurrence of intermittent fluid flow in geological processes, such as the formation of veins and hydraulic breccias. The fluid flow is not continuous but intermittent, characterized by periods of fluid pressure buildup and fracture formation followed by periods of fracture closure and fluid pressure release. The presence of a fluid pressure gradient is essential for the development of dynamic fracture networks, leading to the formation of mobile fracture clusters and fluid transport in periodic pulses. The efficiency of fluid transport is independent of the fracture dynamics, suggesting that the existence of a stable fracture network is not as crucial as often assumed. Instead, areas of heightened fluid pressure, created by previous generations of hydraulic fracture swarms, play a key role in the intermittent fluid flow process. This understanding helps to explain phenomena such as hydraulic breccia formation, which relies on intermittent large-scale fluid pulses.

文献讨论了地质过程中间歇性流体流动的出现，如脉状构造和液压碎屑的形成。这种流体流动不是连续的，而是间歇性的，表现为流体压力累积和断裂形成与流体压力释放和断裂闭合之间的周期性过程。存在流体压力梯度对于动态断裂网络的发展至关重要，导致移动性断裂簇的形成和流体在周期性脉冲中的运输。流体传输效率不受断裂动态的影响，这意味着稳定的断裂网络的存在不如通常认为的那么重要。相反，由前一代液压断裂群创造的高度流体压力区域起着关键作用，解释了间歇性大尺度流体脉冲依赖的现象，如液压碎屑的形成。
