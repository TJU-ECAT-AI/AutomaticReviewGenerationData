<p>Veins commonly exhibit microstructures that are indicative of the crack-seal mechanism [9], where a crack repeatedly opens and is subsequently sealed again by mineral growth (Figure 1).</p>
<p>This crack-sealing, which can be repeated thousands of times in a single vein, indicates that fluid flow is not continuous, but intermittent: fluid pressure builds up to exceed the tensional strength of the rock and cause failure, after which flow can occur until the fracture permeability is sealed offagain [913].</p>
<p>Hydraulic breccias also typically show indications of repeated fracturing in the form of clasts in clasts and brecciated cement [4, 14].</p>
<p>Although evidence for intermittent fluid flow is abundant,relatively little is known on the duration of and time spans between fracturing events.</p>
<p>Assuming a porosity of 10% and a flow rate of 1 m/s, at the upper end of the aforementioned range, the estimated duration of flow (1t) would only be about 2100 s, or a mere few hours. This is a minute fraction of the >100 million years it took to form the breccia.</p>
<p>A number of numerical models for hydrofracture formation exist already [30, 31] while new models are continuously developed [e.g., 3236].</p>
<p>The basic law governing laminar fluid flow q over a distance L through porous media is Darcys law:</p>
<p>q = K 1 Pf ρH2Ogz</p>
<p>In case of vertical fluid flow, and with reference to the surface, L = z and Pf ,surface = 0.</p>
<p>Under these conditions the criterion for failure is simply: Peff> Pcr,</p>
<p>where Peff= σ3 Pf is the effective pressure. The overpressure Po is defined as Po = Peff, if Peff< 0.</p>
<p>Hydraulic fracturing occurs if Po > Pcr.</p>
<p>Another effect of the different fluid and solid pressure gradients is the potential formation of mobile hydraulic fractures (Figure 2B, [1]).</p>
<p>The conductivity of non-fractured crustal material is approximately in the range of 1091012 ms/s [43], several orders of magnitude too small to allow the necessary fluid flow from the source zone to the surface.</p>
<p>Nodes are assumed to be mechanically coupled, which is a typical assumption for the formation and propagation of hydraulic fractures [e.g., 40, 51].</p>
<p>Therefore, if fractures penetrate the sink, a large amount of fluid is quickly drained into a fluid burst, creating the large negative peaks in Figure 5B.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each low viscosity simulation fluid is transported by small mobile hydraulic fractures along distinct vertical pathways.</p>
<p>Once the fracture network is efficient enough to provide continuous pathways from the source to the sink, both the fracture distribution and the fluid mass in the system remain constant.</p>
<p>If fractures close quickly (i.e., the matrix viscosity is low), once the fluid pressure dropped below the solid pressure of the rock matrix.</p>
<p>The development of dynamic fracture patterns in the computer simulationsin difference to a stable stationary fracture networkdepends on the following three preconditions:</p>
<p>• The fluid overpressure is close to the mean tensile strength of the material, otherwise either no fractures form or the entire system fractures homogeneously,</p>
<p>• A fluid pressure gradient is present, as is the case in vertical profiles through the Earths crust,</p>
<p>• Fractures close quickly (i.e., the matrix viscosity is low).</p>
<p>Fluid transport in the crust involves the formation of hydraulic fractures if the fluid overpressure at the source is sufficient.</p>
