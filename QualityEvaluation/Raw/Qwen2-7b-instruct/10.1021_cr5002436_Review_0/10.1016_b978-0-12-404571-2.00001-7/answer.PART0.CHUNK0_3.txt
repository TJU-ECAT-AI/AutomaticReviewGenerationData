[1] "Natural gas resources are typically divided into two categories: conventional and unconventional (Mokhatab et al., 2006; Speight, 2007,2014). Conventional gas typically is found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy ( .1 mD) and can be extracted via tradi- tional techniques."
[2] "In contrast, unconventional gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low permeability (,1 mD) and hence cannot be extracted by conventional methods."
[3] "Natural gasif not disadvantaged by government policies that pro- tect competing fuels, such as coalstands to play a very important role in the US energy mix for decades to come."
[4] "Rising shale gas production has already delivered large beneficial impacts to the United States. Shale gas resources are generally located in close proximity to end-use markets where natural gas is utilized to fuel industry, generate electricity, and heat homes."
[5] "The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (originally named the Clean Energy Act of 2007) is an Act of Congress concerning the energy policy of the United States. The stated purpose of the act is to move the United States toward greater energy independence and energy security."

1. Conventional natural gas is typically found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy and can be extracted using traditional techniques. Unconventional gas, in contrast, is found in reservoirs with low permeability and cannot be extracted conventionally.
2. Natural gas, particularly from shale formations, has the potential to play a significant role in the U.S. energy mix for several decades, provided it is not hindered by protective government policies for competing fuels like coal.
3. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 aimed to increase energy independence and security by promoting the production of clean renewable fuels, enhancing energy efficiency, and improving the energy performance of federal government facilities.
4. Rising shale gas production has led to substantial benefits for the United States, as the resources are often located close to end-user markets where natural gas is used for industrial fuel, electricity generation, and home heating.
5. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 sought to reduce subsidies to the petroleum industry to promote energy independence and different forms of alternative energy, focusing on improving vehicle fuel economy, developing biofuels, and increasing energy efficiency in public buildings and lighting.

1. 常规天然气通常存在于渗透率大于1毫达西（0.1 mD）的储层中，并且可以通过传统技术进行开采。非常规天然气则存在于渗透率较低（小于1 mD）的储层中，因此无法通过传统方法提取。
2. 天然气，特别是来自页岩形成的天然气，有可能在未来几十年对美国能源组合发挥重要作用，前提是它不受保护替代燃料（如煤炭）政策的影响。
3. 《2007年能源独立与安全法案》（原名《2007年清洁能源法案》）是关于美国能源政策的一项国会法案，旨在推动美国向更高的能源独立和能源安全迈进，促进清洁可再生能源生产，提高能源效率，并改善联邦政府设施的能源性能。
4. 上升的页岩气产量已经为美国带来了重大好处，因为这些资源往往靠近用于工业燃料、电力生产和家庭供暖的天然气市场。
5. 《2007年能源独立与安全法案》寻求减少石油行业的补贴以促进能源独立和不同形式的替代能源发展，重点是提高汽车燃油经济性、开发生物燃料以及提高公共建筑和照明的能源效率。
