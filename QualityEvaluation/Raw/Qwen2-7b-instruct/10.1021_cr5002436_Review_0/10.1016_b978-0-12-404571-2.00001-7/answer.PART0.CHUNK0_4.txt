[1] "Natural gas resources are typically divided into two categories: conventional and unconventional (Mokhatab et al., 2006; Speight, 2007,2014). Conventional gas typically is found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy ( .1 mD) and can be extracted via tradi- tional techniques."
[2] "Unconventional gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low permeability (,1 mD) and hence cannot be extracted by conventional methods."
[3] "Natural gasif not disadvantaged by government policies that pro- tect competing fuels, such as coalstands to play a very important role in the US energy mix for decades to come."
[4] "Rising shale gas production has already delivered large beneficial impacts to the United States. Shale gas resources are generally located in close proximity to end-use markets where natural gas is utilized to fuel industry, generate electricity, and heat homes."

1. Conventional natural gas is typically found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy (0.1 mD) and can be extracted using traditional techniques. In contrast, unconventional natural gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low permeability (less than 1 mD), making it inaccessible through conventional extraction methods.

2. Natural gas is poised to play a crucial role in the U.S. energy mix for the foreseeable future, provided it is not hindered by government policies that favor competing fuels like coal.

3. The rising production of shale gas has already brought significant benefits to the United States. This is due to the proximity of shale gas resources to end-use markets, which utilize natural gas for industrial fuel, electricity generation, and home heating.

1. 常规天然气通常存在于渗透率大于1毫达西（0.1 mD）的储层中，并可通过传统技术进行开采。相比之下，非常规天然气存在于渗透率较低（少于1 mD）的储层中，无法通过常规方法提取。

2. 天然气有望在未来几十年内在美国能源结构中扮演重要角色，前提是它不受保护替代燃料如煤炭的政府政策的影响。

3. 美国天然气产量的持续增长已经带来了重大利好。这是由于天然气资源靠近终端市场，这些市场利用天然气为工业提供燃料、发电以及家庭供暖。
