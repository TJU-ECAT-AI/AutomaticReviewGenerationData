[1] "Natural gas resources are typically divided into two categories: conventional and unconventional."
[2] "Conventional gas typically is found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy ( .1 mD) and can be extracted via traditional techniques."
[3] "In contrast, unconventional gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low permeability (,1 mD) and hence cannot be extracted by conventional methods."
[4] "Natural gasif not disadvantaged by government policies that protect competing fuels, such as coalstands to play a very important role in the US energy mix for decades to come."
[5] "Rising shale gas production has already delivered large beneficial impacts to the United States."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Natural gas resources are categorized into conventional and unconventional types. Conventional gas is found in reservoirs with high permeability and can be extracted using traditional techniques. Unconventional gas, on the other hand, is found in reservoirs with low permeability and requires advanced methods for extraction. The increasing production of shale gas in the US has significantly benefited the country's energy mix, playing a crucial role in its energy strategy for decades to come. The US government should consider policies that support the use of natural gas to enhance energy security.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Shale gas is a type of unconventional natural gas found in reservoirs with low permeability, making it difficult to extract using conventional techniques. Conventional natural gas, on the other hand, is found in reservoirs with higher permeability and can be extracted more easily through traditional methods. The development of shale gas has significantly impacted the US energy mix, offering a significant resource that could play a crucial role in the nation's energy strategy for decades to come, assuming favorable government policies.

页岩气是一种非常规天然气，存在于渗透性较低的储层中，难以使用传统方法提取。而常规天然气则存在于渗透性较高的储层中，可以通过传统方法更轻松地进行开采。页岩气的发展对美国能源组合产生了重大影响，提供了可能在未来几十年内扮演关键角色的重要资源，前提是政府政策对竞争燃料如煤炭不提供保护。

[1] "Natural gas is transported by pipeline over long distances because of the pressurization costs of transmission; the need to finance these pipelines encourages long-term contracts that dampen price volatility."

Energy security has been an on-again-off-again political issue in the United States since the first Arab oil embargo in 1973. The energy literature and numerous statements by officials of oil- and-gas-producing and oil-and-gas-consuming countries indicate that the concept of energy security is elusive. Definitions of energy security range from uninterrupted oil supplies to the physical security of energy facilities to support for biofuels and renewable energy resources.

1. Conventional natural gas is typically found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy and can be extracted using traditional techniques. Unconventional gas, in contrast, is found in reservoirs with low permeability and cannot be extracted conventionally.
2. Natural gas, particularly from shale formations, has the potential to play a significant role in the U.S. energy mix for several decades, provided it is not hindered by protective government policies for competing fuels like coal.
3. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 aimed to increase energy independence and security by promoting the production of clean renewable fuels, enhancing energy efficiency, and improving the energy performance of federal government facilities.
4. Rising shale gas production has led to substantial benefits for the United States, as the resources are often located close to end-user markets where natural gas is used for industrial fuel, electricity generation, and home heating.
5. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 sought to reduce subsidies to the petroleum industry to promote energy independence and different forms of alternative energy, focusing on improving vehicle fuel economy, developing biofuels, and increasing energy efficiency in public buildings and lighting.

1. 常规天然气通常存在于渗透率大于1毫达西（0.1 mD）的储层中，并且可以通过传统技术进行开采。非常规天然气则存在于渗透率较低（小于1 mD）的储层中，因此无法通过传统方法提取。
2. 天然气，特别是来自页岩形成的天然气，有可能在未来几十年对美国能源组合发挥重要作用，前提是它不受保护替代燃料（如煤炭）政策的影响。
3. 《2007年能源独立与安全法案》（原名《2007年清洁能源法案》）是关于美国能源政策的一项国会法案，旨在推动美国向更高的能源独立和能源安全迈进，促进清洁可再生能源生产，提高能源效率，并改善联邦政府设施的能源性能。
4. 上升的页岩气产量已经为美国带来了重大好处，因为这些资源往往靠近用于工业燃料、电力生产和家庭供暖的天然气市场。
5. 《2007年能源独立与安全法案》寻求减少石油行业的补贴以促进能源独立和不同形式的替代能源发展，重点是提高汽车燃油经济性、开发生物燃料以及提高公共建筑和照明的能源效率。

1. Conventional natural gas is typically found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy (0.1 mD) and can be extracted using traditional techniques. In contrast, unconventional natural gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low permeability (less than 1 mD), making it inaccessible through conventional extraction methods.

2. Natural gas is poised to play a crucial role in the U.S. energy mix for the foreseeable future, provided it is not hindered by government policies that favor competing fuels like coal.

3. The rising production of shale gas has already brought significant benefits to the United States. This is due to the proximity of shale gas resources to end-use markets, which utilize natural gas for industrial fuel, electricity generation, and home heating.
