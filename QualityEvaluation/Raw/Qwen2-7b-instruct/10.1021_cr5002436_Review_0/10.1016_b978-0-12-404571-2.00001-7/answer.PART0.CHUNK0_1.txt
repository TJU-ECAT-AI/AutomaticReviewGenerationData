[1] "Natural gas resources are typically divided into two categories: conventional and unconventional (Mokhatab et al., 2006; Speight, 2007,2014). Conventional gas typically is found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy ( .1 mD) and can be extracted via traditional techniques."
[2] "In contrast, unconventional gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low permeability (,1 mD) and hence cannot be extracted by conventional methods."
[3] "Natural gasif not disadvantaged by government policies that pro- tect competing fuels, such as coalstands to play a very important role in the US energy mix for decades to come."

Shale gas is a type of unconventional natural gas found in reservoirs with low permeability, making it difficult to extract using conventional techniques. Conventional natural gas, on the other hand, is found in reservoirs with higher permeability and can be extracted more easily through traditional methods. The development of shale gas has significantly impacted the US energy mix, offering a significant resource that could play a crucial role in the nation's energy strategy for decades to come, assuming favorable government policies.

页岩气是一种非常规天然气，存在于渗透性较低的储层中，难以使用传统方法提取。而常规天然气则存在于渗透性较高的储层中，可以通过传统方法更轻松地进行开采。页岩气的发展对美国能源组合产生了重大影响，提供了可能在未来几十年内扮演关键角色的重要资源，前提是政府政策对竞争燃料如煤炭不提供保护。
