[1] "Natural gas resources are typically divided into two categories: conventional and unconventional."
[2] "Conventional gas typically is found in reservoirs with a permeability greater than 1 millidarcy ( .1 mD) and can be extracted via traditional techniques."
[3] "In contrast, unconventional gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low permeability (,1 mD) and hence cannot be extracted by conventional methods."
[4] "Natural gasif not disadvantaged by government policies that protect competing fuels, such as coalstands to play a very important role in the US energy mix for decades to come."
[5] "Rising shale gas production has already delivered large beneficial impacts to the United States."

Natural gas resources are categorized into conventional and unconventional types. Conventional gas is found in reservoirs with high permeability and can be extracted using traditional techniques. Unconventional gas, on the other hand, is found in reservoirs with low permeability and requires advanced methods for extraction. The increasing production of shale gas in the US has significantly benefited the country's energy mix, playing a crucial role in its energy strategy for decades to come. The US government should consider policies that support the use of natural gas to enhance energy security.

天然气资源分为常规和非常规两大类。常规天然气存在于渗透率较高的储层中，可通过传统技术开采。而非常规天然气则存在于渗透率较低的储层中，需要采用先进方法进行开采。美国的页岩气产量增长已经带来了显著的能源益处，对美国的能源结构起到了关键作用，并将在未来几十年内持续发挥重要作用。美国政府应考虑制定政策支持天然气的使用，以增强能源安全。
