Answer: Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications. They are used in the production of plastics, solvents, and fuels, contributing significantly to market trends. Their synthesis involves several key production methods, including the steam cracking of naphtha, coal, and natural gas. Thermodynamic challenges are associated with these processes, primarily concerning optimal temperature and pressure conditions for efficient conversion. The efficiency of olefin production also depends on factors like alkane chain length, which affects the selectivity and yield of the desired olefin products. These challenges necessitate careful control over reaction parameters to achieve high-quality olefin outputs while minimizing energy consumption and waste generation.
