Abstract
Membrane reactors applied to catalytic reactions are currently being studied in many places world-wide. Signiﬁcant
developments in membrane science and the vision of process intensiﬁcation by multifunctional reactors have stimulated a
lot of academic and industrial research, which is impressively demonstrated by more than 100 scientiﬁc papers on catalytic
membrane reactors being published per year. Palladium as a noble metal with exceptional hydrogen permeation properties
and, at the same time, broad applicability as a catalyst, ﬁrst of all for hydrogenation, is part of many of these developments.
This paper discusses two different membrane reactor concepts which both rely on supported palladium, on the one hand as
a permselective membrane material, and on the other hand as base component of a membrane-type hydrogenation catalyst.
Dense palladium composite membranes can be used for hydrogen separation from packed-bed catalysts in gas-phase hydro-
carbon dehydrogenation reactions. Mesoporous membranes containing dispersed bimetallic Pd/X-clusters can be employed as
so-called catalytic diffusers for liquid-phase hydrogenation, e.g. of nitrate and nitrite in water. The principles of both concepts
are introduced, recently obtained experimental data are evaluated in connection with literature results, and the perspectives
for further development are highlighted. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

tive removal of products from the reaction zone (cf.

ucts. In a different approach only particular reactants
are supplied selectively via a membrane to the reaction
zone (cf. Fig. 1b), e.g. to establish an optimum con-
centration proﬁle along the reactor. A third concept
refers to a membrane that creates a well-deﬁned reac-
tion interface (or region) between two reactant streams
(cf. Fig. 1c).
The mass transport across a membrane can be
permselective if only some components of a mixed
stream permeate through the membrane (cf. Fig. 1a
and b) or non-permselective if all species perme-
ate at comparable rates (cf. Fig. 1c). Permselective
transport is found ﬁrst of all in dense membranes.
It is governed by a solution-diffusion mechanism.
Non-permselective
transport
normally
occurs
in
macro- and mesoporous membranes. In the latter
Knudsen diffusion is often the dominating trans-
port mechanism. Microporous membranes represent
a bit of both: permselective and non-permselective
transport is possible depending on the size of the
permeating molecules in view of the pore size of the
membrane (bottlenecks) as well as on the chemical
nature of the permeating molecules and the membrane
material.

Fig. 1. Classiﬁcation of membrane reactor concepts according to the membrane functions.
When the membrane reactor is used for carrying
out a catalysed reaction the questions arises whether
the membrane itself has a catalytic function or not.
If the membrane acts as a catalyst we refer to this
as a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR, cf. Fig. 1e
and f), if not we have an inert membrane catalytic
reactor (IMCR, cf. Fig. 1d). The CMR-case may be
further subdivided into two categories, i.e. when the
membrane acts as the sole catalyst (cf. Fig. 1e), and
when a conventional catalyst is present in addition to
the membrane (cf. Fig. 1f).
Other authors have introduced similar acronyms
for an easy reference to the different membrane re-
actor types. Tsotsis et al. [1] refer to a catalytic
138

non-permselective membrane reactor (CNMR) as to a
reactor with a catalytic membrane which is not perms-
elective but provides for a well-deﬁned interface for
two (or more) reactants ﬂowing on opposite sides of
the membrane (cf. Fig. 1c). In contrast their deﬁnition
of a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) requires a
permselective membrane (cf. Fig. 1e). In both cases
the membrane acts as the sole catalyst. The same
authors assigned the acronyms PBMR and FBMR to
the packed-bed and ﬂuidised-bed membrane reactor
where the membrane is permselective but not catalytic
(cf. Fig. 1d). The opposite cases, i.e. with catalytic and
permselective membrane, are referred to as PBCMR
and FBCMR, respectively (cf. Fig. 1f). Coronas and
Santamaria [2] used the notations CMR and IMR to
distinguish between the catalytic and the inert mem-
brane reactor. According to their deﬁnition the CMR
has no other type of catalyst except the membrane.
Consequently a third category “combined” is intro-
duced to refer to membrane reactor conﬁgurations
where the catalyst is placed both inside and outside
the membrane. No further distinction is made in view
of the permselectivity, i.e. whether the membrane per-
forms a separation task, whether it provides a reaction
interface for different reactant streams, or whether it
acts only as a special type of catalyst support, e.g.
to minimise the mass transport resistance when the
whole feed stream is passed through it in cross-ﬂow.
In the past 15 years many valuable reviews on mem-
brane reactors have been published [1–21]. It is not the
intention of this paper to add one more to the list but
rather to emphasise the use of palladium in this ﬁeld.
2. Membrane reactors based on
palladium alloy membranes
It is well established that dense palladium and pal-
ladium alloy membranes are permeable for hydrogen
only. Two main possibilities arise from this feature to
employ these in membrane reactors, namely
1. to promote a dehydrogenation reaction by removal
of the produced hydrogen from a dehydrogenation
catalyst through the membrane, i.e. preventing the
establishment of the chemical equilibrium, or
2. to carry out a hydrogenation reaction on the palla-
dium surface with supply of hydrogen through the
membrane.
The purpose of the use of the palladium membrane
as well as its function differs considerable in both
types of applications. In case (1) the aim is to increase
the conversion of an equilibrium limited reaction by
removal of one of the products. The dehydrogenation
occurs in the gas phase over a conventional catalyst
(e.g. a packed-bed) which is surrounded by the pal-
ladium membrane. In principle the palladium surface
could act as a dehydrogenation catalyst too, but then
the reaction rate would be too small due to the low sur-
face area. Hence, the membrane has no primary cat-
alytic function. In case (2) the purpose can be two-fold:
to promote a selective hydrogenation by deliberately
dosing hydrogen through the membrane, or to utilise
an existing diluted hydrogen gas to perform the hydro-
genation. In both situations the palladium membrane
has a catalytic function.
From an engineering point of view case (2) has a
limited potential, at least for gas-phase hydrogena-
tions. It is true that palladium is a versatile hydro-
genation catalyst, but the reaction rate normally is
proportional to the surface area of the catalyst, pro-
vided no diffusion limitation occurs and the active sites
are uniformly distributed over the surface. Conven-
tional hydrogenation catalysts have the palladium in
highly dispersed form, e.g. as nanoscale metal clusters
inside a porous pellet, and hence do offer a large pal-
ladium surface area. Compared to this the accessible
surface area of a dense palladium membrane is small.
If the hydrogenation is to be performed in the liq-
uid phase the situation may be different because then
the reaction rate is often controlled by the kinetics of
hydrogen mass transfer, and the available active sur-
face inside the porous catalyst is utilised anyway only
in part. Liquid-phase hydrogenations are carried out at
high pressure due to the poor solubility of hydrogen
in most organic liquids. Palladium membranes would
allow for a simpliﬁcation of the process design, as
they could take over both the catalytic function and
the task of dosing hydrogen. High pressure operation
could then be avoided. Combined with a clear beneﬁt
in selectivity there might be interesting applications
of this concept in the ﬁne chemicals area. However,
most of the recent studies using palladium-based mem-
branes in literature are aimed at hydrogen removal
from packed-bed catalysts either to boost the yield
of industrially important dehydrogenation reactions
(propane, isobutane/n-butane, ethylbenzene, etc.) or to

139
provide pure hydrogen (steam reforming of methane
or methanol, water-gas-shift reaction), e.g. for use in
low-temperature (PEM) fuel cell stacks. Hence, the
discussion here is restricted to this type of application
only.
2.1. Working principle of a inert membrane
catalytic reactor with removal of hydrogen
The principle of a hydrogen permselective mem-
brane reactor equipped with a packed-bed of cata-
lyst and a surrounding palladium-based membrane has
been described many times in literature. Fig. 2 illus-
trates the situation. The dehydrogenation occurs on
the packed-bed catalyst, and the produced hydrogen
is withdrawn through the membrane. The transport
through the membrane is driven by the hydrogen par-
tial pressure difference between the packed-bed (i.e.
retentate) side and the permeate side. Three different
possibilities exist to create the driving force:
1. Use of an inert sweep gas in the permeate compart-
ment (e.g. nitrogen, helium, etc.).
2. Application of a pressure difference between re-
tentate and permeate compartment (if necessary by
evacuation of the permeate).
3. Use of a reactive sweep gas to consume the perme-
ated hydrogen (e.g. oxygen, air, carbon monoxide,
unsaturated hydrocarbons, etc.).
Which of these possibilities is the best depends on
the particular situation. In general, the worst case is
the inert sweep gas because this has to be provided and
compressed, and a diluted hydrogen gas is produced

with a conventional packed-bed catalyst.
which can be used only as a fuel gas with low caloriﬁc
value. If the kinetics of the hydrogen producing re-
action do allow an operation at elevated pressure, for
instance in the range of 1–3 MPa, this becomes an at-
tractive option because then the pressure difference is
sufﬁciently large to ﬂush out the permeated hydrogen.
The advantages are that no sweep gas is required and
that pure hydrogen is obtained as a marketable prod-
uct. On the other hand, the feed gas has to be com-
pressed but the produced hydrogen is obtained at low
pressure, which limits its usability and could make a
recompression necessary. If pure hydrogen, e.g. for a
fuel cell, is the target product of the membrane reactor,
then an operation at elevated retentate pressure is the
only viable option. The third option, i.e. reacting the
permeated hydrogen with the sweep gas, is promising
because it avoids the disadvantages of the other two.
Moreover, since hydrogen producing reactions are en-
dothermic in most cases (hydrocarbon dehydrogena-
tion and hydrocarbon steam reforming) it is favourable
to generate the required heat right in the permeate
compartment. An exothermic hydrogen-consuming re-
action can be carried out for this purpose, if possible
employing the palladium membrane surface as a cat-
alyst. Hydrogen oxidation with air or hydrogenation
of an organic compound are candidates if they ﬁt with
the required reactor temperature. The disadvantage of
hydrogen oxidation is that a high-valued product is
used to heat the dehydrogenation. The other case, cou-
pling of the dehydrogenation process to a second syn-
thesis, is difﬁcult to run at optimised conditions in a
commercial-scale reactor because of the reduced de-
gree of freedom.
2.2. Development of palladium-based membranes
First investigations of the hydrogen absorption and
diffusion through palladium were reported by Gra-
ham in 1866 [22]. Today it is well known that hy-
drogen permeates with an inﬁnite selectivity via a
solution-diffusion mechanism through palladium and
its alloys. The permeation is based on a multi-step
process. First molecular hydrogen is adsorbed on the
palladium surface, where the dissociation into atomic
hydrogen takes place. Then the hydrogen atoms enter
the palladium lattice and diffuse through the lattice,
while the electrons interact with the metal lattice. On
the adjacent side the hydrogen atoms leave the lattice
140

and recombine on the surface, before they are ﬁnally
desorbed as hydrogen molecules [23].
It is also well known that the use of pure palla-
dium membranes is hindered by the fact that palladium
shows a transition from the -phase (hydrogen-poor)
to the -phase (hydrogen-rich) at temperatures be-
low 300◦C and pressures below 2 MPa, which de-
pends on the hydrogen concentration in the metal.
Since the lattice constant of the -phase is 3% larger
than that of the -phase this transition leads to lat-
tice strain and, consequently, after a few cycles to
a distortion of the metal lattice [24]. Alloying the
palladium, especially with silver, reduces the critical
temperature for this embrittlement and leads to an
increase of the hydrogen permeability. A maximum
value of the hydrogen ﬂow is reached for an alloy
with approximately 23 wt.% silver [25,26]. Similar to
Pd/Ag, other alloys, e.g. Pd/Y or Pd/Ce show high
hydrogen permeability and good mechanical stability
[27].
Palladium-based membranes have been used for
decades to provide ultra-pure hydrogen, e.g. in the
semiconductors industry and for the operation of fuel
cells [28,29]. They were exploited to extract tritium
from liquid-metal tritium breeders [30]. In recent years
there has been a growing interest in the industrial ap-
plication of palladium-based membranes for hydrogen
producing reactions. Extensive investigations were
conducted for the employment of palladium-based
membranes for hydrogen removal to shift thermody-
namic (equilibrium) limitations towards higher con-
versions, e.g. during dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
[31–33], steam reforming of methane [34–36] and the
water-gas-shift reaction [37]. And it was shown that
hydrogen feeding through palladium membranes can
improve the selectivity of hydrogenation reactions
[38]. Key requirements for the successful development
of palladium-based membranes are low costs as well as
high hydrogen permeability and permselectivity com-
bined with good mechanical/thermal and long-term
stability.
2.2.1. Dense palladium-based membranes
Early work focused on the application of relatively
thick unsupported dense metal membranes prepared
by conventional metallurgical processes. In 1964 John-
son Matthey developed a hydrogen puriﬁcation equip-
ment which employed a Pd/Ag tube [39]. However,
the use of these membrane reactors is limited by the
low hydrogen ﬂow which is inversely proportional to
the thickness of the membrane. Self supporting dense
palladium-based membranes possess wall thicknesses
greater than 50–100 m to keep a sufﬁcient mechani-
cal strength. These membranes are too thick to obtain
a satisfactory hydrogen ﬂux. Besides the low perme-
ance, thick palladium membranes are too expensive
for an economic use, in particular since the price of
palladium has tremendously increased over the last
few years. For practical use it is necessary to reduce
the thickness of the palladium layer. Composite metal
membranes and composite porous membranes seem
to be an advisable choice to overcome these disadvan-
tages.
2.2.2. Palladium-based composite metal membranes
Palladium-based composite metal membranes con-
sist of a thin layer of palladium or a palladium
alloy coated on one or both sides of a hydrogen
permeable base refractory metal such as niobium,
vanadium or tantalum. These metals possess a high
mechanical strength and are less expensive than palla-
dium. Furthermore, the hydrogen ﬂow through these
body-centred cubic metals is higher than through the
face-centred cubic palladium [40,41]. Unfortunately
the direct replacement of palladium for these metals is
not possible due to the formation of oxide layers and
to surface reactions which reduce the hydrogen ﬂow
through the membrane [42]. In 1967 Makrides et al.
[43] ﬁled a patent for plating foils of Group VB metals
with thin layers of palladium using sputter deposition.
However, it has been reported that the hydrogen ﬂux
through palladium-based composite metal membranes
decreases with time at high temperatures. Intermetal-
lic diffusion between the metal layer and the base
metal is the most likely reason for this notice [44].
To overcome this problem it was suggested to use
a diffusion barrier between the base and the coating
metal, e.g. thermal stable oxide layers such as alumina
[44,45].
2.2.3. Palladium-based composite porous membranes
Palladium-based
composite
porous
membranes
consist of a thin dense layer of palladium or a pal-
ladium alloy on a porous support. Tubes or discs of
porous glass, porous ceramics or porous stainless steel
can all be employed as supports. Different techniques
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
141
such as chemical vapour deposition [46,47], mag-
netron sputtering [46,48], electrodeposition [49] and
spray pyrolysis [50] have demonstrated the ability to
coat palladium-based ﬁlms on porous substrates [51].
Each method has its advantages. However, due to its
simplicity, relatively low costs and uniformity of the
deposition, electroless plating is the most popular and
most successful procedure so far [52–55]. It is based
on the autocatalytic reduction of a metastable metallic
salt complex on an activated substrate surface. New
preparation methods combine the electroless plating
with reverse osmosis to obtain composite membranes
with better thermal stability and higher permeance
[56,57]. Excellent results have been reported re-
cently for ultrathin composite membranes prepared
by a modiﬁed electroless plating method, where the
classical substrate surface activation has been re-
placed by a new photocatalytic deposition method
[58,59].
2.3. Experimental
2.3.1. Preparation of palladium-based composite
membranes
Many academic and industrial groups have de-
veloped palladium-based composite membranes in
research projects, but so far no such products are avail-
able on a normal commercial basis. For our studies
on the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in palladium
membrane reactors we too have looked at different
techniques for the manufacture of hydrogen perms-
elective palladium and palladium–silver composite
membranes. Details are reported in [60,61]. For the re-
sults presented in this paper mainly electroless plating
was used. Asymmetric sintered porous stainless steel
tubes supplied by GKN Sinter Metals Krebsöge Filters
GmbH, Radevormwald (Germany), and asymmetric
porous -alumina tubes purchased from Inocermic
GmbH, Hermsdorf (Germany), were employed as
supports for the palladium plating. Both types have
the same outer diameter of 10 mm and a comparable
inner diameter of 6.5 mm for the sintered metal tubes
and 7 mm for the ceramic tubes. The sintered metal
tubes consist of two layers with different pore size.
The nominal pore diameter of the ﬁne layer, located
on the shell side, is around 500 nm. The ceramic tubes
have four layers with graded pore size. The ﬁnest layer
has a mean pore diameter of 100 nm. The palladium
was deposited always onto the layer with the ﬁnest
pores.
The porous substrates were ﬁrst cut to 11 cm length
and cleaned with ammoniac solution, isopropyl alco-
hol and de-ionised water. Following the cleaning the
substrate surface was seeded with Pd nuclei, which
initiates the auto-catalytic reduction of the palladium
complex in the subsequent plating step. For this pur-
pose the tubes were successively immersed at ambient
temperature in a tin chloride solution followed by an
acidic palladium chloride bath. This sequence was re-
peated 10 times. Afterwards the palladium deposition
was carried out at 60◦C in a plating bath containing
a palladium–amine complex as palladium source, hy-
drazine as reducer and EDTA as stabilising agent (cf.
Table 1). The plating solution was changed every hour
to keep the plating rate constant. Palladium deposition
occurred according to Eq. (1).
2Pd2+ + N2H4 + 4OH−→2Pd + N2 + 4H2O
(1)
After the plating the membranes were rinsed with
de-ionised water and dried overnight at 120◦C in a
drying oven.
Palladium–silver composite membranes were pre-
pared by successive deposition of palladium and sil-
ver on the porous supports followed by a heat treat-
ment [53]. The ﬁrst step was the preparation of a pal-
ladium layer as described above. Afterwards silver
was deposited on the palladium ﬁlm also by the elec-
troless plating technique, which leads to the forma-
tion of a thin double layer of palladium and silver on
the porous tube. The silver plating solution consisted
mainly of an EDTA stabilised silver–amine complex
with hydrazine as reducing agent (cf. Table 1). Silver

After the plating the membranes were heated up to
700◦C for 12 h under an atmosphere of argon. These
high temperatures lead to the formation of a homoge-
neous palladium–silver ﬁlm by thermal diffusion [53].
The thickness of the palladium and palladium–silver
layers was determined from SEM micrographs and
from the weight difference before and after the plating
combined with the densities of the metals and under
the assumption of uniform coverage.

2.3.2. Permeation measurements
The separation behaviour of the palladium compos-
ite membranes was investigated in the permeation ap-
paratus shown schematically in Fig. 3. Details of the
permeation unit are given in Fig. 4. The experiments
were conducted with pure hydrogen and pure nitro-
gen as well as with a binary gas mixture of hydrogen
with nitrogen. The temperature was varied between
350 and 650◦C, and the pressure difference reached
up to 400 kPa. Measurements were carried out with
no sweep gas at atmospheric or low pressure on the
permeate side and with nitrogen as sweep gas at at-
mospheric pressure. The heating rate was 1 K/min and
below 300◦C both sides of the membrane were kept
under nitrogen to avoid hydrogen embrittlement. The
desired feed gases were introduced with the aid of ther-
mal mass ﬂow controllers. The pressures on the reten-
tate and permeate sides of the membrane were adjusted
with back pressure controllers. The axial temperature
proﬁle of the reactor was monitored with thermocou-
ples. The temperature variation over the whole length
of the membrane did not exceed ±4◦C. The gas ﬂows
leaving the reactor were measured by a thermal mass
ﬂow meter or a digital soap bubble ﬂow meter. A gas

of the permeate and the retentate. The membrane was
installed in the reactor by sealing both ends of the tube
with graphite rings.
2.4. Results and discussion
2.4.1. Characterisation of the composite
membranes by SEM
The surface morphology of an electroless deposited
palladium ﬁlm is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen
that the palladium ﬁlm is composed of ﬁne palla-
dium grains. These grains are grown well together
and form a dense palladium layer on the support.
The minimum thickness of the palladium layer must
be about 3 m or greater with the above technique
to get layers without pinholes. Fig. 6 shows a SEM
micrograph of a palladium–silver surface after the
ﬁnal heat treatment. X-ray diffraction patterns of
the surface of this membrane before (a) and after
(b) the heat treatment are given in Fig. 7. After the
plating the reﬂection peaks of pure silver and pure
palladium can be seen among the peaks of the alu-
mina support. After the heat treatment the peaks of

the pure metals have disappeared and peaks of the
palladium–silver alloy can be observed. These peaks
lie between those for silver and palladium and shift
with higher palladium contents to higher diffraction
angles.

2.4.2. Permeation behaviour of the composite
membranes
The quality of the prepared membranes was ﬁrst
examined by a simple pressure hold test at ambient
temperature with nitrogen using gas-tight polymeric
seals. At pressure differences up to 400 kPa the ni-
trogen ﬂow through composite membranes with pal-
ladium layers thicker than 3 m was negligible, i.e.
less than 0.01 ml/cm2 min (STP). This conﬁrms that
the palladium layers have very few defects.
As
mentioned
before
the
hydrogen
diffusion
through palladium occurs via a solution/diffusion
mechanism. This transport is frequently described by
Eq. (3) as follows:
J = Q
l (pn
HR −pn
HP)
(3)
where J is the ﬂux of hydrogen, Q is the permeabil-
ity, l denotes the thickness of the palladium layer, pHR
and pHP stand for the hydrogen partial pressure in the
permeate and retentate, and n is the hydrogen pressure
exponent. The quotient Q/l is referred to as perme-
ance or pressure normalised ﬂux. The expression in
parenthesis gives the driving force for the permeation.
The value of n is often used as an indicator for the
rate-controlling step of the permeation through a metal
composite membrane. If the diffusion of atomic hy-
drogen through the dense metal layer is rate-limiting,
then the hydrogen ﬂow is directly proportional to the
difference of the square root of the hydrogen partial
pressure on both sides of the membrane (Sieverts’s
law) [25].
Figs. 8 and 9 illustrate the results of permeation
experiments with pure gases. The hydrogen ﬂow and
the nitrogen ﬂow through a palladium–alumina mem-
brane is shown as a function of temperature for pres-
sure differences between retentate and permeate up to
250 kPa. The palladium layer of the membrane was
about 15 m thick. No sweep gas was used, and the
pressure on the permeate side was kept at atmospheric
level (105 kPa). The hydrogen ﬂow increases with ris-
ing temperature and transmembrane pressure differ-
ence. The nitrogen ﬂow remains nearly unchanged
with temperature but increases also with higher pres-
sure difference. Under the same conditions the hydro-
gen ﬂow is much higher than the nitrogen ﬂow. Yet
the nitrogen ﬂow measured in the permeation cell is
even at ambient temperature about 10–80 times higher

to 355 kPa; ﬁxed permeate pressure of 105 kPa.
than that detected in a pressure hold test with poly-
meric seals. This indicates that the graphite seals are
not perfectly tight, i.e. the major part of the nitrogen
ﬂow shown in Fig. 9 does not pass through defects
in the membrane layer but through small leaks at the
seals.
The values detected for the hydrogen pressure ex-
ponent generally range between 0.6 and 0.7 for our
composite membranes made by electroless plating.
Fig. 10 shows the dependency of the hydrogen and
nitrogen ﬂuxes on the transmembrane partial pressure
difference for a membrane with 7 m thickness of
the palladium layer and 400◦C. These data originate
from single-gas permeation experiments and from runs

with hydrogen–nitrogen mixtures. Both types of ex-
periments were performed at ambient permeate pres-
sure and elevated retentate pressure without a sweep
gas. The points are well described by pressure expo-
nents of 0.61 for hydrogen (determined by regression)
and 1.0 for nitrogen.
The gentle deviation of the hydrogen pressure ex-
ponent from the theoretical value of 0.5 suggests that
the hydrogen ﬂux depends not exclusively on atomic
diffusion through the palladium but is inﬂuenced to
some extent by other processes, e.g. hydrogen adsorp-
tion on the palladium surface. It has been claimed that
surface processes control the permeance of very thin
palladium ﬁlms [51], and for ultrathin palladium lay-
ers values of n close to 1.0 have been reported by dif-
ferent groups [49,58]. Table 2 provides a collection of
literature results for various types of palladium com-
posite membranes with different thicknesses. From
this it appears that membranes thinner than 4–5 m
show a hydrogen pressure exponent near 1.0. Still no
reliable limiting thickness can be given because the
palladium layers have different morphologies and the
ﬂux data in most cases are analysed only graphically
whether they comply with a prescribed pressure ex-
ponent of 0.5 or 1. On the other hand, if estimates for
n are determined from measured ﬂuxes by regression
conﬁdence in these estimates is limited because the
experiments cover only a restricted range of the pres-
sure difference, and the sensitivity of the ﬂux to the
pressure exponent is known to be weak [55].
The separation factor of a non-porous composite
palladium membrane is deﬁned as the ratio of the
hydrogen ﬂux to the ﬂux of an inert species, e.g. nitro-
gen, at the same conditions. If the ﬂuxes are based on
permeation measurements with pure gases, the sepa-
ration factor is referred to as ideal. The separation fac-
tors of our membranes determined from experiments
in the permeation cell range from roughly 100 to over
1000. They decrease with increasing transmembrane
pressure difference. This is reasonable because the
nitrogen ﬂow through leaks at the graphite seals or
through remaining defects in the palladium ﬁlm is
more strongly affected by the pressure difference than
the hydrogen ﬂux through the palladium. The separa-
tion factors increase with higher temperature because
the hydrogen ﬂux rises with temperature, whereas the
nitrogen ﬂux is almost independent of temperature.
However, the thickness of the palladium layer de-
termines the effect of temperature on the separation
factor. Layers thinner than about 6 m undergo a

signiﬁcant reduction of the separation factor at tem-
peratures over 500◦C [73]. These membranes showed
lower hydrogen permselectivities during permeation
measurements with binary mixtures of hydrogen with
nitrogen compared to single-gas hydrogen measure-
ments after a nitrogen test. In contrast membranes
with palladium layers thicker than about 6 m showed
good thermal stability up to 650◦C (cf. Figs. 8 and 9)
and no difference in the hydrogen/nitrogen permse-
lectivity when changing from pure gases to mixtures,
as it can be seen in Fig. 10.
The hydrogen transport through a non-porous pal-
ladium ﬁlm is an activated process. Under the as-
sumption that the hydrogen pressure exponent does
not depend on temperature the relationship between
the hydrogen permeability and the temperature can
be described by an Arrhenius law as follows:

was derived [73]. This value is in good agreement
with those reported by other groups. For instance
Weyten et al. [74] found 11–12 kJ/mol, Li et. al.
[77] detected 12.3 kJ/mol, and Uemiya et al. [53]
reported 10.7 kJ/mol for similar palladium composite
membranes.
From Fig. 8 it can be seen that an increase of the
retentate pressure leads to an increase of the hydro-
gen permeation rate. In cases where a high retentate
pressure is unfavourable, e.g. for the dehydrogena-
tion of hydrocarbons, a sufﬁcient driving force for
hydrogen permeation can be created by decreasing
the permeate pressure. Fig. 12 compares the effect of
these two methods on the hydrogen ﬂux through a
palladium–alumina membrane at 400◦C. The exper-
iments with permeate evacuation were performed at
permeate pressures down to 25 kPa. No signiﬁcant dif-
ferences were observed, i.e. the results of both types of
experiments fall together when plotting the hydrogen
ﬂux versus the driving force using the right hydrogen
pressure exponent of 0.61.
The effect of a nitrogen sweep gas in the perme-
ate compartment is shown in Fig. 13. The sweep gas
reduces the partial pressure of hydrogen in the perme-
ate and therefore increases the driving force for the
permeation. The permeate pressure was kept constant
at 105 kPa during these experiments, whereas the re-
tentate pressure was varied from 125 to 225 kPa. The
sweep gas efﬁciency is highest at the lowest pressure

sweep gas supplied on the support side of the membrane (cf.
Fig. 4 for the design of the permeation cell). Inﬂuence of the

difference. For a retentate pressure of 125 kPa the hy-
drogen ﬂux was raised by a factor of 3.7 at the highest
nitrogen ﬂow rate of 610 ml/min while it was increased
only by 33% at 225 kPa (660 ml/min N2). This can be
attributed to the increased hydrogen ﬂow through the
membrane at higher pressure differences, which leads
to a higher partial pressure of hydrogen at a given
sweep gas ﬂow rate. Note that the partial pressure of
hydrogen in the permeate is not constant along the
reactor when a sweep gas is used. It increases from
zero at the entrance until to the highest value reached
at the outlet. For example, at a retentate pressure of
125 kPa the hydrogen partial pressure in the permeate
at the reactor outlet decreases from 105 kPa when no
sweep gas is supplied to 41.4 kPa at the highest sweep
gas ﬂow rate of 610 ml/min. For the same sweep gas
ﬂow the hydrogen partial pressure in the permeate is
reduced only to 57.2 kPa when the retentate pressure
is set to 225 kPa. A second observation from Fig. 13
is that the slope of the curves levels off rather quickly
with increasing sweep gas ﬂow rate. Obviously for
high sweep gas ﬂow rates no real improvement of the
hydrogen ﬂux is observed even at high retentate pres-
sures (i.e. high hydrogen ﬂows) although the hydrogen
partial pressure in the permeate is decreased substan-
tially with increasing sweep gas ﬂow. This behaviour is

found only when the sweep gas is supplied on the sup-
port side of the membrane. It can be explained by the
diffusion resistance of the support which leads to an
increase of the hydrogen partial pressure in the pores
of the support towards the surface of the palladium
layer. In Fig. 14 the hydrogen ﬂuxes obtained from
experiments with the nitrogen sweep gas supplied on
different sides of the membrane are compared. Clearly
the sweep gas is more effective on the palladium side.
Fig. 14 also shows the calculated hydrogen ﬂux as a
function of the sweep gas ﬂow rate based on a simple
one-dimensional plug-ﬂow reactor model using Eq. (3)
to describe the permeation of hydrogen. The agree-
ment between the measurements and the simulation
results is very good for the case where the sweep gas
is supplied on the palladium side. In the opposite case
the simple model overestimates the hydrogen ﬂux, as
it does not take into account the diffusion resistance
of the support.
In a further experiment the membrane referred to
in Fig. 10 was operated continuously at 400◦C for
about 1600 h, yet not at unchanged operating condi-
tions. Fig. 15 shows the development of the hydrogen
and nitrogen ﬂuxes over time at an equal partial pres-
sure difference of 45 kPa. Fig. 16 displays the separa-
tion factors. For each time reported several permeation
experiments were carried out within short time to de-
termine the partial pressure dependence of the ﬂuxes,
e.g. with different retentate pressures (pure gases) or
with different hydrogen mole fractions in the retentate
(H2/N2 mixtures). This allowed to convert the ﬂuxes
to a common driving force of 45 kPa for easy compar-
ison.
During the ﬁrst 220 h single-gas measurements with
hydrogen followed by nitrogen and measurements
with binary mixtures of hydrogen with nitrogen were
carried out in an alternating fashion. Later on only
measurements with pure hydrogen or binary mixtures
were performed. The obtained hydrogen pressure ex-
ponents did not show any systematic changes over the
whole duration of the experiment but only random
ﬂuctuations between 0.6 and 0.7. Still the hydrogen
ﬂux curves from the two types of measurements do
not fall together, in particular not during the initial
phase (t < 400 h). Despite these differences in the
hydrogen ﬂux the nitrogen ﬂuxes from both methods
are in good agreement from the beginning on, which
means that no pinholes were formed and the mea-
sured effects are related to the intact palladium layer.
Again the moderate separation factors of 80–140 (bi-
nary mixtures) evident from Fig. 16 are caused by a
certain leakage at the graphite seals.
The hydrogen ﬂux of the fresh membrane was
3.5 ml/cm2 min. This value was found with pure hy-
drogen and with a hydrogen–nitrogen mixture. In the
initial phase the hydrogen ﬂux increased with time
pointing to structural changes of the palladium layer,
e.g. a change of the grain size or a compaction of the
layer. Note that no temperature treatment had been
applied to the membranes before the experiment. This
increase is witnessed both by the single-gas results
and by the mixture data, but in the single-gas experi-
ments higher hydrogen ﬂows were detected compared
to the experiments with mixtures. So far no indu-
bitable explanation can be given for this behaviour. It
is assumed that a change of the atmosphere from pure
hydrogen to pure nitrogen, that comes along with a
complete release of the hydrogen dissolved in the
metal, leads to a temporary increase of the hydrogen
permeability of the palladium layer caused by a mod-
iﬁcation of its surface or its grain structure. This is
based on the observation that the ﬁrst measurement of
the hydrogen ﬂux after a nitrogen test always showed
a distinctly higher hydrogen ﬂow even though the ni-
trogen ﬂow before was unchanged. In the sequel the

hydrogen ﬂow returned. Yet the interpretation of this
effect suffers from the superimposed increase of the
hydrogen ﬂux with time. After two cycles (t > 220 h)
no further single-gas nitrogen tests were performed
and the membrane was kept constantly in contact
with a hydrogen containing atmosphere. This brought
the single-gas hydrogen ﬂow slowly down from the
peak value of 14.7 to about 8 ml/cm2 min, which was
the stationary level detected in the experiments with
binary mixtures. The question why the hydrogen ﬂux
measured with pure hydrogen needed about 200 h to
return to the same level as found in the experiments
with hydrogen/nitrogen mixtures remains open just as
the question why it slowly increased again after pass-
ing a minimum at about 450 h. Further studies on the
supposed structural changes of the palladium layer are
necessary to elucidate the reasons for this behaviour.
2.4.3. Comparison of the permeation results with
published data
A comparison of the permeation results of the
membranes prepared in this work with published
data of similar membranes at a ﬁrst glance reveals
many similarities (ﬂux, separation factor and apparent

difference. Comparison with extrapolated hydrogen ﬂows through self-supporting palladium foils.
activation energy). However, a large scattering of the
published data becomes evident when trying to evalu-
ate all results on a common basis, i.e. as a function of
the thickness of the metal layer and for a given tem-
perature and a given hydrogen partial pressure differ-
ence. This holds even when focusing solely on pure
palladium membranes with high H2/N2 separation
factors. Fig. 17 shows a plot of the hydrogen ﬂux at
400◦C versus the thickness of the palladium layer for
composite palladium membranes reported by different
groups. The data were taken from various tables and
ﬁgures in the original papers [53,55,57,59,64–77]. In
some cases it was necessary to convert the ﬂuxes to
the common hydrogen partial pressure difference of
100 kPa to enable a direct comparison. If so this was
done employing the hydrogen pressure exponents
given by the authors. The solid lines represent cal-
culations for self-supporting palladium foils relating
the ﬂux to the inverse thickness of the palladium.
These lines mark the behaviour expected when the
diffusion of hydrogen atoms controls the permeation
rate. Sorption effects and the diffusion resistance
of the boundary layers are ignored. Three different
sources [78–80], each based on measurements with

151
foils of 50 m thickness or higher, were used which
obviously show good agreement.
The ﬁrst observation is that the hydrogen ﬂuxes de-
termined with supported palladium layers mainly fall
below the theoretical line of the self-supporting pal-
ladium foils, although a few membranes have shown
higher values. The majority of the data points lies in
the shaded region in Fig. 17. The hydrogen ﬂuxes of
membranes with palladium layers above 12 m thick-
ness show rather good conformity. These membranes
have been all made by electroless plating. The devia-
tion increases as the palladium thickness is decreased.
Hughes and co-workers reported hydrogen ﬂuxes for
supported palladium layers prepared by electroless
plating (osmotic pressure method) ranging from 5 to
28 ml/cm2 min (cf. Fig. 17, circles) [57,70,69]. Even
more pronounced are the differences described by
Morooka and co-workers [64–66]. They reported hy-
drogen ﬂuxes ranging from 8 to 54 ml/cm2 min for
palladium layers with approximately 5 m thickness
prepared by CVD (cf. Fig. 17, triangles). Very low
hydrogen ﬂuxes have been reported by Paglieri et al.
[75] for palladium layers below 12 m thickness
which have been deposited by electroless plating, al-
though in a previous publication higher values were
reported for membranes with even thicker palladium
layers (cf. Fig. 17, rhombuses) [71].
A number of factors may be responsible for the
deviating results. Some errors are certainly associ-
ated with the fact that the membranes have been used
not exactly under the same experimental conditions
and that the data have been read in part from ﬁgures
or were converted to a common partial pressure dif-
ference. Another important factor is the difﬁculty to
determine the true thickness of the palladium layers,
e.g. by weight increase of the membranes after palla-
dium deposition or by measuring the thickness from
SEM micrographs taken at different locations. Partic-
ular problems occur when the palladium penetrates
into the pores of the support, or when the deposi-
tion on the surface is not homogeneous. Besides, the
palladium layers deposited by electroless plating and
CVD are less compact than palladium foils produced
by metallurgical techniques like cold rolling and have
a different microstructure. It can be expected that the
microstructure is linked to the permeability. Impurities
introduced with the chemicals used or decomposition
products formed during the preparation (carbon) can
also change the permeability. In the preparation by
CVD a ﬁlling up of the support pores with small-sized
palladium particles starting from the pore walls takes
place as opposed to the growth of a connected ﬁlm on
top of the surface in electroless plating. It has been
reported that the hydrogen transport through palla-
dium composite membranes made by CVD is not
governed by the usual solution-diffusion mechanism.
To explain this some authors have claimed that hy-
drogen diffuses along narrow pores whose walls are
covered with palladium [64–66]. Others assumed a
short-range solution-diffusion transport through indi-
vidual palladium grains interrupted by molecular dif-
fusion across the intergranular volume [47]. A linear
dependence of the hydrogen ﬂux on the partial pres-
sure difference was found for CVD-type palladium
composite membranes with metal thicknesses around
5 m, whereas deﬁnitely lower hydrogen pressure
exponents were detected for electroless plated mem-
branes with palladium layers of similar thickness. The
hydrogen ﬂuxes through most CVD-type membranes
are lower than expected in view of the palladium
thickness [62,81]. Together with the observed increase
of the hydrogen ﬂux with increasing palladium grain
size [47] this seems to backup the supposed transport
mechanism.
Some of the best permeation results so far have
been obtained with a modiﬁed electroless plating
where the activation of the surface was achieved by
photocatalysed deposition of palladium on a TiO2
membrane [59]. After the plating a coherent pal-
ladium ﬁlm of 0.3–0.4 m thickness was obtained
which showed a hydrogen ﬂux of 40 ml/cm2 min at
400◦C and a hydrogen partial pressure difference of
100 kPa. This membrane had a hydrogen pressure
exponent close to 1 indicating that surface processes
control the hydrogen ﬂux.
What is not discussed in most publications is the
change of the permeation properties with time and
with changing gas atmospheres. From Fig. 15 we read
hydrogen ﬂuxes ranging from 3.5 to 14.7 ml/cm2 min
for the same membrane depending on the history of
the measurement. The stationary hydrogen ﬂux of this
membrane was between 8 and 10 ml/cm2 min and was
obtained not before some hundred hours of operation.
Note that at any time of the experiment the hydrogen
partial pressure exponents determined from measure-
ments with different hydrogen pressures were in the
152
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
same range (0.6–0.7) and no change of the nitrogen
ﬂux was detected.
One must conclude that the available experimental
data do not allow to assess the maximum hydrogen
ﬂux through an ultrathin composite palladium mem-
brane. It is not clear yet at which palladium thickness
surface processes actually begin to control the perme-
ance, and no detailed information is available on the
inﬂuence of the microstructure of differently produced
palladium layers on the hydrogen permeance and the
permselectivity.
The transition from atomic diffusion control to a
control by surface effects depending on the thickness
of the palladium layer can be analysed using a rather
simple model. It has been said that the permeation
of hydrogen through a palladium membrane is a se-
quence of several steps. If one ignores the diffusion
resistance of the support and of possible boundary lay-
ers the ﬁrst step is the adsorption of hydrogen which
is accompanied by a dissociation:
H2 + 2[ ] ⇔2[H]
(5)
The adsorption is reversible, hence the net rate can
be expressed by the difference between the adsorption
and desorption rates as follows:
¯
r = kapH2θ2 −kdθ2
H
(6)
The next step is the entry of hydrogen atoms into the
palladium lattice. In the most simple concept hydrogen
can enter the palladium lattice at any of the adsorption
sites. Although in reality a lateral displacement may
be necessary because the entry occurs only at speciﬁc
positions in the lattice [82] we prefer here the most
simple case. Moreover, we assume that the transfer-
ence of hydrogen into the lattice is fast compared to
the subsequent diffusion. Under these conditions the
ﬂux can be written alternatively to Eq. (3) in terms of
the surface coverage of hydrogen as follows:
J = Q∗

where J denotes the hydrogen ﬂux, Q∗the permeabil-
ity coefﬁcient and l is the thickness of the palladium
layer.
The third step is the release of hydrogen atoms from
the lattice to the surface, and the fourth step is the
recombination and desorption of hydrogen to the per-
meate. These two can be summarised and treated the
same way as steps 1 and 2, again provided that the re-
lease of hydrogen atoms from the lattice occurs much
faster than the atomic diffusion.
We assume further that on either surface of the
membrane we have the same number of adsorption
sites per unit area, that is the same values of ka and kd
hold for the retentate and permeate sides. The hydro-
gen balance for the palladium surface at the retentate
side reads

we have

If no other species are adsorbed on the palladium sur-
face except hydrogen we can write a very simple bal-
ance for the surface coverage as follows:
θHR + θR = 1,
θHP + θP = 1
(10)
Combining Eq. (10) with Eqs. (8) and (9) yields two
non-linear equations for the unknown surface cover-
ages θHR and θHP which can be solved numerically
for given values of the adsorption and desorption rate
constants ka and kd and the permeability coefﬁcient

This model was used to analyse the permeation data of
our composite palladium membranes (only pure Pd)
having palladium thicknesses between 5 and 15 m.
The idea was that the measured partial pressure depen-
dence of the hydrogen ﬂux reﬂects the combined in-
ﬂuences of the atomic diffusion through the palladium
layer and the adsorption/desorption on the palladium
surface. Hence, it should be possible to determine a
set of estimates for ka, kd and Q∗which can account
for the permeation behaviour of the membranes and
provides a basis for an estimation of the inﬂuence of
the palladium thickness on the hydrogen ﬂux.

Data from 36 permeation measurements with
electroless plated palladium membranes of different
palladium thickness (5, 7, 10, 13 and 15 m) were
evaluated. All measurements were made at 400◦C.
One additional dataset from measurements with a
70 m thick palladium layer (prepared by thermal
spraying [61]) at the same temperature was added
to secure that the model is able to reproduce the
permeation behaviour of thick palladium layers. The
weighting factor 1/nd in Eq. (12) ensures that each
group of data related to a certain membrane thickness
contributes equally to the objective function. nd de-
notes the number of experiments carried out with a
membrane of thickness d, whereas nm is the number
of membranes (i.e. different thicknesses). The devia-
tion between measured and calculated ﬂuxes is scaled
with the measured ﬂuxes, which means that the mea-
surement error is supposed to be proportional to the
measured ﬂux.
The data were analysed by calculating and plotting
the objective function versus the three parameters ka,

value of 105 mol/m2 s).

a correlation was detected among the parameters kd
and Q∗. For given values of kd parameter estimates
for ka and Q∗were successively determined. Fig. 18
shows the estimates of ka and Q∗as a function of kd.
From this it is obvious that a square-root dependence
between the optimal values for Q∗and kd exists while
no such correlation is effective between ka and kd. The
residual objective function does not vary much with
changing kd. Only a weak minimum exists close to
kd = 105 mol/m2 s with Q∗= 1.38×10−3 mol m/m2 s
and ka = 8 × 10−6 mol/m2 s Pa. Fig. 19 shows a

timum which reveals a fair accuracy of the estimation
of these parameters for ﬁxed kd. The residual value
of the objective function is around 0.01215. This cor-
responds to an average deviation of 11% between the
measured and calculated hydrogen ﬂuxes (related to
the measured values).
The model can describe the measured partial pres-
sure dependence of the hydrogen ﬂux quite well. This
is evident from the Figs. 20 and 21 which show the
data for a membrane with 7 m palladium thickness.
Besides it can reproduce the increase of the hydrogen
ﬂux with reduced palladium thickness, as it is shown
in Fig. 22. The model predicts that the hydrogen ﬂux
could reach up to 0.4 mol/m2 s for very thin palladium
layers, which then is controlled by the kinetics of the
surface processes. At high palladium thicknesses the
predicted hydrogen ﬂuxes coincide with the values
obtained for palladium foils, reported for example by
Itoh et al. [78]. The predicted hydrogen ﬂux for pal-
ladium thicknesses in the sub-micron range is slightly
higher than the ﬂux measured by Wu et al. [59].
However, in view of the fact that the model is extrap-
olated and that the transport resistance of the support
may already have some inﬂuence in this range the
prediction seems to be reasonable. This holds also for
the change of the hydrogen pressure exponent with

is deﬁned in relation to Eq. (3), whereas the model
represented by Eqs. (6)–(11) has no such parameter.
The curves in Fig. 23 were obtained by evaluating
simulation results from Eqs. (6)–(11) with the simpli-
ﬁed Eq. (3). One dataset refers to constant hydrogen
pressure in the retentate and changing permeate pres-
sure (upper curve) and the other vice versa (lower
curve). The deviation between the two datasets shows

that the model predicts a difference in the hydrogen
pressure exponent depending on the hydrogen pres-
sure. Low hydrogen pressures (permeate evacuation)
give higher values of n compared to high hydrogen
pressures (increased retentate pressure). Our mem-
branes have thicknesses in the range of 5–15 m. In
this range the predicted hydrogen pressure exponent
varies between 0.6 and 0.7, as it was found also in
the experiments.
2.4.4. Kinetic compatibility of hydrogen
generation and hydrogen removal
The performance of a packed-bed membrane re-
actor depends not only on the permeation behaviour
of the membranes employed. The basic requirement
for a signiﬁcant increase of the overall reaction rate
is that the generation of the product which is to be
withdrawn by the membrane must occur at a rate
comparable to the permeation rate. More precisely,
the amount of product generated in a given volume of
the packed-bed per unit time must match the amount
of product permeating per unit time through the
membrane area enclosing this volume at the existing
transmembrane partial pressure difference. The two
numbers to be compared here are the volume-based
rate of hydrogen formation and the volume-based rate
of hydrogen permeation, as described in Eq. (13).

(13)
The former is the product of the effective hydrogen
generation rate per unit weight of catalyst with the
packed-bed density. The latter is the hydrogen per-
meance of the membrane multiplied with the driving
force for the permeation multiplied with the mem-
brane area per unit volume. Neither the left side nor
the right side of Eq. (13) are constant within the re-
action volume. The reaction rate is inﬂuenced by the
temperature and by the concentration of the reactants.
Hence, it varies along the reactor axis, and if radial
gradients are present, also in radial direction. If heat
or mass transfer limitations from the gas phase to the
catalyst pellets or inside the pellets exist, then the reac-
tion rate varies also within the catalyst. The hydrogen
ﬂux across the membrane is affected by the tempera-
ture and by the partial pressure difference of hydrogen
which changes along the reactor axis likewise. A quan-
titative assessment would require a thorough reactor
simulation considering the kinetics of all relevant pro-
cesses, which is not the intention of this paper. Yet a
quick analysis of the kinetic compatibility of reaction
and permeation is attempted by inserting appropriate
average values for the quantities in Eq. (13). Table 3
shows the results for two common dehydrogenation
reactions which we have studied experimentally. The
hydrogen generation rates were determined from ki-
netic experiments in lab-scale packed-bed reactors op-
erated at conversions well below the equilibrium level.
The ﬁrst example is the dehydrogenation of ethyl-
benzene to styrene on a commercial iron oxide cata-
lyst. The crucial factors of this process are the high
dilution of the ethylbenzene feed with steam which is
necessary among other things to prevent carbon depo-
sition and the low pressure which is applied to reach a
high conversion. Both factors are responsible for the
low reaction rate and the small driving force for the hy-
drogen permeation. The maximum partial pressure of
hydrogen in the retentate given in Table 3 corresponds
to the equilibrium composition for the speciﬁed ref-
erence conditions. The maximum hydrogen ﬂux was
calculated based on the assumption that this value is
reached in the retentate, whereas in the permeate the
hydrogen partial pressure is close to zero. The true
(average) driving force is lower, but as a ﬁrst approx-
imation it is instructive to use this best case scenario
for estimating the minimum membrane area required.
The experimentally determined hydrogen genera-
tion rate depends on the particle size of the catalyst.

Conventional extruded pellets with 3 mm diameter
show a reduced reaction rate compared to ﬁne catalyst
particles obtained by crushing of the original pel-
lets (values in parenthesis). Obviously pore diffusion
limitation leads to concentration gradients inside the
pellets which lower the reaction rate. The calculation
according to Eq. (13) reveals that depending on the
particle size of the catalyst minimum membrane ar-
eas between 83.7 and 154.2 m−1 would be needed. If
one assumes a tubular geometry where the membrane
and the catalyst are both placed on the tube side, this
would be equivalent to a maximum inner diameter of
the tubes of 47.8 or 25.9 mm, respectively. If a kinetic
model [83] is used to predict the rate of hydrogen
generation for the conditions at the reactor entrance,
that is at zero conversion, one obtains a value around
6 mol/m3 s. This is the theoretical maximum of the
hydrogen formation rate of the catalyst. It would re-
quire a membrane area of 264 m−1 or a tube diameter
of 15.1 mm, respectively.
The second example shown in Table 3 is the
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on a
chromia-based catalyst. Compared to ethylbenzene
dehydrogenation the hydrogen generation rate per
unit volume is much higher, and so the differences
between the reaction rates obtained with pellets and
ﬁne particles are more pronounced. The reaction rate
is higher mainly because the feed is not diluted with
an excess of steam but only with about 20% hydrogen
to control the carbon deposition rate. This leads to a
reasonable driving force for hydrogen permeation but
also to a low equilibrium conversion, which in turn in-
creases the potential beneﬁt of the membrane reactor.
However, due to the carbon deposition the activity of
the catalyst decreases gradually, which makes a cyclic
operation necessary. After several hours on stream
the catalyst must be re-oxidised with air to restore its
activity. Since in the commercial process hydrogen
is added to the feed to extend the dehydrogenation
time, it is feared that in the membrane reactor the

157
activity might deteriorate more quickly when a large
fraction of the produced hydrogen is removed from
the packed-bed. The required membrane area is larger
than for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation although the
difference is not so pronounced as suggested by the
difference of the reaction rates because the driving
force for the permeation is higher likewise. For the
pellet catalyst a tube diameter of 40.7 mm would be
the highest, whereas for the crushed catalyst a tube
diameter below 14.1 mm is needed. The theoretical
maximum of the hydrogen generation rate for the
listed reference conditions determined from the ki-
netic model is about 46 mol/m3 s and would require
a membrane area of 412 m−1 or a tube diameter of
9.7 mm, respectively. These estimates refer to the ini-
tial activity. However, the activity decreases with time
so that the cycle-averaged reaction rates are lower
than the values given in Table 3. Therefore, larger
tube diameters might be effective as well.
In both examples signiﬁcant differences occur be-
tween the catalytic activity of pellets and crushed
particles demonstrating the impact of pore diffusion
limitation on the performance of the catalysts. The hy-
drogen generation rate could be increased by decreas-
ing the diffusion resistance, i.e. reducing the catalyst
dimensions, but under the high throughput conditions
of industrial packed-bed reactors this would cause a
prohibitive pressure drop. One concept that might be
interesting then is to coat the catalyst directly on the
membrane, i.e. on the opposite side of the palladium
layer, as it is indicated in Fig. 24. A rough estimate
Fig. 24. Basic principle of a palladium composite membrane with
built-in dehydrogenation catalyst. Qualitative shape of the con-
centration proﬁles of the reactants over the composite membrane.
The catalyst may be applied in the form of a separate layer, as it
is shown here, or be integrated in the membrane support.
of the necessary thickness of the catalytic layer can
be derived from the reciprocal of the minimum mem-
brane area in Table 3 which gives the catalyst volume
per unit (membrane) area. This must be multiplied
with the factor 1 −eb because the rate of hydrogen
generation is based on the overall packed-bed volume
including the voidage, while a catalyst layer on the
membrane is equivalent to a ﬂat plate with a density
comparable to a normal pellet. If we consider the
maximum reaction rate calculated from the kinetic
models we obtain a thickness of the catalytic layer
of 1.9 mm for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and of
1.2 mm for propane dehydrogenation. Since this falls
into the range of the support thickness of the com-
posite membrane one option could be to integrate the
dehydrogenation catalyst directly into the membrane
support to give a structured membrane catalyst.
An additional advantage of a thin catalyst layer on
the adjacent side of the membrane could be an im-
proved temperature control. The dehydrogenation con-
sumes a large amount of heat. In a tubular packed-bed
of a few centimetres diameter a temperature decrease
by 10–30 K from the wall to the centre is not unusual
and may lead to a signiﬁcant reduction of the reaction
rate. This can be avoided if the permeated hydrogen
is burned on the shell side of the membrane and the
heat of the reaction is transported via heat conduction
over relatively short distance to the catalytic reaction
zone in the membrane support. Yet so far no sufﬁcient
experimental results are available which would allow
to judge the potential of such a concept for real appli-
cations.
2.4.4.1. Inﬂuence of the reaction rate law.
Besides
the magnitude of the hydrogen generation rate their
dependence on the partial pressure of the reactants can
have ready additional hurdles. Hydrocarbon dehydro-
genations are endothermic reactions which are associ-
ated with a volume increase according to the general
stoichiometry:
CmHn+2
k+
⇄
k−CmHn + H2,
HR > 0
(14)
Hence, the equilibrium conversion increases towards
higher temperature and lower pressure. If one ignores
undesired side reactions the overall dehydrogenation
rate can be described in many cases by the rate law
158

given in Eq. (15), which considers that the unsaturated
product is more strongly adsorbed on the catalyst than
the hydrocarbon feedstock. This was conﬁrmed also
for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and propane dehy-
drogenation.

where k is the rate constant, Kp the equilibrium con-
stant of the reaction, and KCmHn is the adsorption equi-
librium constant of the unsaturated product. All three
are a function of the temperature. While the rate con-
stant and the equilibrium constant both increase with
higher temperature, the adsorption equilibrium con-
stant decreases as a matter of the reduced surface cov-
erage. The exponent q of the adsorption term in the
denominator is normally equal to 1 or 2, depending on
the number of surface sites involved in the rate con-
trolling step.
It is obvious from Eq. (15) that the drop of the re-
action rate to zero upon approaching the equilibrium
composition can be prevented in a membrane reac-
tor by withdrawal of the produced hydrogen from the
catalyst. Theoretically, if the entire hydrogen could
be removed, the reverse reaction would be completely
blocked. However, depending on the value of KCmHn
the beneﬁcial effect of hydrogen removal on the reac-
tion rate can be counteracted with increasing conver-
sion by a growing inhibition of the reaction rate due
to adsorption of the unsaturated product. Fig. 25 il-
lustrates this inﬂuence for the simple case of an ideal
plug-ﬂow membrane reactor working at constant tem-
perature. It is based on the general form of the design
equation of a plug-ﬂow reactor, valid for arbitrary ki-

version of 1 mol/m3 s. The area below the curves in
Fig. 25 represents the integral on the right side of
Eq. (16). It is a direct measure of the residence time
needed for a desired conversion at a given feed con-
centration.

removal of the produced hydrogen in a packed-bed
membrane reactor and no adsorption of the unsatu-
rated hydrocarbon, i.e. pH2 = 0 and KCnHm = 0.
The reverse reaction is completely blocked, and so
full conversion can be achieved. The reaction rate de-
creases linearly with increasing conversion. This is
the optimum with respect to a high reaction rate, i.e.
a low amount of catalyst required. Curve (B) shows
the same situation but without removal of hydrogen,
as it would occur in a conventional packed-bed reac-
tor. The reaction is reversible and hence it cannot sur-
pass the equilibrium conversion, which is about 0.8 in
this example. Curve (B) is always above curve (A).

This reﬂects the lower space time yield of the con-
ventional packed-bed reactor compared to the ideal
membrane reactor. The gap between the two curves
becomes larger with shrinking distance to the equilib-
rium conversion because the conventional reactor then
suffers from the growing rate of the reverse reaction.
Curves (C)–(E) also stand for the reaction in the
conventional packed-bed reactor but with inhibition by
adsorption of the target product CmHn. The value of
the product KCmHnp0
CmHn+2 speciﬁes the extent of this
inhibition. It gives the maximum increase of the de-
nominator in Eq. (15) for the hypothetical case that the
partial pressure of the product would reach the initial
partial pressure of the hydrocarbon feed component.
A value of 0.2 for this parameter was used for calcula-
tion of curve (C). This marks a reduction of the reac-
tion rate due to product adsorption not exceeding 20%.
Curve (D) shows the situation for KCmHnp0
CmHn+2 =
1.0, that is halving of the reaction rate. Curve (E)
stands for the case that the product almost blocks the
catalyst (KCmHnp0
CmHn+2 = 10). Here the denomina-
tor would increase by one order of magnitude at full
conversion. With increasing inhibition the curves are
shifted upwards because the reaction rate is lowered.
Curve (F) refers to the same parameters as curve
(E) but in the ideal membrane reactor with complete
removal of hydrogen. Due to the strong inhibition the
reaction rate is lower than for curve (A), but the re-
action can be carried out until completion. The in-
ﬂuence of the preferred adsorption of the product on
the effectiveness of the membrane reactor is shown
more directly in Fig. 26, which gives the integrals of
the curves belonging to the cases (A/B) and (F/E) of
Fig. 25 as a function of the conversion. For clarity
of the graphic representation a less diluted hydrocar-
bon feed was assumed (p0
CmHn+2 = 50 kPa) resulting
in a reduced equilibrium conversion of 57.5% at un-
changed value of Kp (30 kPa).
Point (1) denotes a suitable operating point of the
conventional packed-bed reactor close to the equilib-

reference conversion but for the case with strong ad-
sorption of the target product, i.e. KCmHnp0
CmHn+2 =
10, which would require a 4.5 times higher catalyst
volume. The calculation for an ideal membrane reac-
tor having the same catalyst volume gives a conver-
sion of X∗

2.4.5. Current status of membrane reactor
experiments for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation
There is no doubt about the usefulness of qualitative
estimations and detailed kinetic simulations in trying
to assess the potential of palladium-based membrane
reactors, but at the end experiments have to conﬁrm
the theoretical predictions and so an evaluation of
the available experimental results is useful to com-
plete this report. Palladium-based membranes were
tested in the past in numerous reactions with removal
or supply of hydrogen to packed-bed catalysts (cf.
[19,20]). We do not attempt to review the whole ﬁeld
but restrict ourselves to hydrocarbon dehydrogena-
tion, and here to representative applications where the
literature contains a substantial body of experimental
data.
2.4.5.1. Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene.
One of the early applications of palladium membrane
reactors was the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to
benzene [84–87]. Itoh [85] used a palladium tube with
200 m wall thickness, 140 mm length and 17 mm di-
ameter. The tube was uniformly packed with cylindri-
cal pellets of a noble metal catalyst (3.3 mm×3.6 mm).
The reaction conditions were 200◦C and 100 kPa, and
the cyclohexane was diluted by argon. Argon was
utilised also as a sweep gas. It was shown that the
conversion of cyclohexane in the membrane reactor
can be increased to nearly 100% at sufﬁciently large
residence times and by using enough sweep gas.
However, the space velocity was very low in these
experiments (GHSV = 0.7–4.2 h−1) and so was the
hydrogen generation rate per unit volume (RH2 =
0.03–0.12 mol/m3 s). In view of the low reaction rate
the low hydrogen ﬂux through the 200 m thick palla-
dium tube wall was still sufﬁcient not to limit the per-
formance of the membrane reactor. The mole fraction
of cyclohexane in the feed was 19.7% and an equi-
librium conversion of 18.7% was detected in a con-
ventional packed-bed reactor. From these values the
hydrogen partial pressure at the equilibrium is es-
timated to 10 kPa and hence, according to the per-
meation kinetics given, the maximum hydrogen ﬂux
through the membrane is 1.87 × 10−3 mol/m2 s. This
ﬁnally gives a minimum required membrane area of
57 m−1 corresponding to a tube diameter of 70 mm.
The actual tube diameter was 17 mm, which con-
ﬁrms that the membrane is not expected to limit the
performance.
In later studies Itoh and Wu showed experimen-
tally for the same system under similar reaction condi-
tions and using a palladium–silver tubular membrane
(length 191 mm, diameter 10.4 mm and wall thick-
ness 0.2 m) that the permeated hydrogen can be re-
moved efﬁciently by passing an oxygen-containing
sweep gas through the permeate compartment, and
that the heat produced by oxidation of the hydrogen
leads to an increase of the packed-bed temperature in
a quasi-adiabatic operation [86,87]. No particular ex-
cess of the oxygen-containing sweep gas ﬂow over the
cyclohexane ﬂow is required except that the amount
of oxygen supplied must be high enough to convert
all the permeated hydrogen.
These results nicely demonstrate the beneﬁts of
hydrogen removal in a palladium membrane reac-
tor. However, the cyclohexane system must be seen
primarily as a model reaction without immediate
signiﬁcance for an industrial application.
2.4.5.2. Dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane to
toluene.
A similar reaction, but with some techno-
logical background, is the dehydrogenation of methyl-
cyclohexane to toluene, which was investigated by Ali
et al. [33] in the context of the usage of hydrogen as
secondary energy carrier. The concept is as follows:
toluene, acting as a hydrogen carrier, is hydrogenated
to methylcyclohexane with hydrogen produced from
hydroelectric power to store the energy in an organic
liquid. Upon demand methylcyclohexane is catalyti-
cally dehydrogenated and the released hydrogen can
be used for stationary or mobile electricity generation.
The membrane reactor used in the experimental
studies was a 250 mm long stainless steel tube with an
inner diameter of 15.8 mm. A palladium–silver tube of
3.1 mm diameter and 200 m wall thickness, closed
at one end, was placed in the centre line of this reac-
tor. The reactor was charged with a commercial noble
metal catalyst of about 1 mm particle size diluted with
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
161
spherical glass beads (bulk catalyst volume 4.15 cm3).
The reaction was studied in the temperature range of
300–400◦C at reaction pressures of 0.5–2 MPa and liq-
uid hourly space velocities of 2–12 h−1. The perme-
ate pressure was slightly above the atmospheric level
because no sweep gas was employed.
It could be shown that in the membrane reactor con-
versions signiﬁcantly above the equilibrium value can
be achieved, despite that the hydrogen permeation rate
was reduced by about 14% in presence of the organic
products. For example, at 1.5 MPa and 340◦C the con-
version of methylcyclohexane was 48% at LHSV =
10.2 h−1, 59.5% at LHSV = 6.5 h−1, and 80% at
LHSV = 3.6 h−1 compared to the equilibrium value
of 42%. The lower efﬁciency of the membrane reac-
tor at high space velocities can be traced back to the
limiting hydrogen permeance. This becomes evident
if the hydrogen generation rate is compared to the hy-
drogen permeation rate. Upon increasing the space ve-
locity from 3.6 to 10.2 h−1 the hydrogen generation
rate per unit volume was raised from 1.85 mol/m3 s
almost linearly to 3.2 mol/m3 s, whereas the perme-
ation rate increased only initially a little from 0.0312
to 0.0347 mol/m2 s. The membrane area per unit vol-
ume required for a match of the hydrogen genera-
tion and permeation rates is 59.3 m−1 for LHSV =
3.6 h−1 and 92.2 m−1 for LHSV = 10.2 h−1. In the
membrane reactor 22.9 cm2 of membrane area were
available for a packed-bed volume of 41.5 cm3, which
gives a volume-based membrane area of 55.2 m−1.
This shows that for low space velocities, i.e. below
LHSV = 3 h−1, the available membrane area is more
or less sufﬁcient, whereas for higher space veloci-
ties the produced hydrogen cannot be removed fast
enough. A better performance of the membrane reac-
tor at higher space velocity can be expected if a mem-
brane with reduced thickness of the palladium–silver
layer is available. An alternative is to increase the
membrane area inside the reactor or to reduce the
amount of catalyst per unit volume (higher dilution of
the packed-bed).
Even though the performance in this system obvi-
ously is limited by the membrane, the results show
that a palladium membrane reactor can give higher
conversions than the equilibrium values also at indus-
trially feasible space velocities, provided that the re-
action rate is high enough. The membrane and the
catalyst were stable for more than 300 h on stream
with intermittent shutdown of the methylcyclohexane
feed overnight (i.e. replacement by hydrogen) and with
temperature cycling, and it could be shown that the
membrane and the catalyst can be liberated from con-
taminants by oxidation in air.
However, one must be aware of the fact that the
catalyst has been diluted 10 times with glass beads so
that the space time yield of the reactor is still low. In a
real application working without dilution in the same
range of the space velocity would require much better
membranes or a much higher membrane area per unit
volume.
Ali and Baiker [88] reported additional results
on this system a few years later, where they used
an undiluted catalyst bed (1.6 mm particle size and
43.1 cm3 bed volume) and a palladium–silver mem-
brane of reduced wall thickness (100 m). The length
(230/239 mm) and the diameter (3.1 mm) of the mem-
brane were unchanged. The reactor temperature and
pressure were similar as in the previous study, i.e.
320–400◦C and 1.5 MPa (0.1 MPa permeate pres-
sure), whereas the space velocity was reduced to
0.5–2.6 h−1. Also under these conditions the mem-
brane reactor gave conversions above the equilibrium,
e.g. 90% versus 73.3% at 370◦C and LHSV = 1 h−1.
The conversion increase was more pronounced at
low temperatures where the equilibrium restriction is
more severe. However, the conversion declined more
strongly with increasing space velocity in the mem-
brane reactor than in the conventional packed-bed,
which still indicates a limitation by the permeance. A
quantitative analysis showed that the membrane was
able to remove most of the produced hydrogen only
at space velocities below LHSV = 1 h−1. At higher
space velocities the reactor performance became more
and more controlled by the permeation rate and hence
the conversion increase was suppressed. Low space
velocities are unattractive for industrial operation be-
cause they are connected to low space time yields.
An optimum space velocity of 1.65 h−1 at 370◦C was
reported as a compromise with regard to high conver-
sion and high reaction rate. Under these conditions the
membrane reactor reached 78% conversion compared
to the equilibrium conversion of 73.3%. The reference
conversion in a conventional reactor was 65%. Putting
the hydrogen generation rate (8.4 mol/m3 s) in relation
to the permeation rate (0.103 mol/m2 s) shows that
a membrane area per unit volume of 81 m−1 would
162

have been required for a match of both. The mem-
brane reactor used had only 22.9 cm2 membrane area
for a total packed-bed volume of 41.3 cm3, which is
equivalent to a value of 55.4 m−1. This conﬁrms the
limitation by the permeation rate. The hydrogen ﬂux
through the membrane was about three times higher
than in the previous study, but due to the undiluted
catalyst bed the hydrogen generation rate per unit vol-
ume was increased likewise, i.e. by a factor of 2.6–4.5
depending on the point of reference (LHSV = 3.6
or 10.2 h−1). A second limitation of the performance
of the membrane reactor was by the heat input. The
temperature of the undiluted catalyst bed dropped
signiﬁcantly at high reaction rates (high space veloc-
ity) as a matter of the strong endothermicity of the
reaction (H R > 200 kJ/mol).
The ﬁnal conclusions from the work on methylcy-
clohexane dehydrogenation are that the effectiveness
of the membrane reactor could be further increased by
the use of better membranes, i.e. with reduced thick-
ness of the palladium layer, in order to overcome the
limitation by the permeation rate. Obviously an excel-
lent catalyst is available which does not suffer from the
adsorption of the product toluene and the associated
decrease of the reaction rate at high conversions (cf.
[89] and the discussion in the previous section). The
results have been obtained under industrially relevant
space velocities and with realistic feed concentrations
and operating pressures. Hence, they seem to prove the
technical feasibility of a palladium-based membrane
reactor for this reaction. Long-term studies will have
to demonstrate the performance over a realistic pe-
riod of time, and the detected heat transfer limitation
may require a more sophisticated reactor module de-
sign, but the main problem still is the high palladium
thickness of the commercial palladium–silver mem-
branes, which are not economically viable due to the
high price of the palladium.
2.4.5.3. Dehydrogenation of alkanes to oleﬁns.
A
variety of n- and isoalkane dehydrogenations have
been
studied
experimentally
in
palladium-based
membrane reactors. Among those reactions propane
dehydrogenation has probably received the most
interest over the last years. Other feedstocks have
been, for example, ethane, n-butane, isobutane or
isopentane. Alkane dehydrogenations are industri-
ally important reactions since the oleﬁns produced
represent basic petrochemical building blocks, e.g.
for the manufacture of plastics. These reactions all
need high temperatures to proceed at reasonable
rates and to shift the conversion to levels of practical
signiﬁcance. Another feature they have in common
is the formation of carbon deposits which must be
prevented or at least diminished to an acceptable
level.
Sheintuch and Dessau [90] studied the dehydro-
genation of isobutane and propane in packed-bed
membrane reactors equipped with commercial tubular
palladium–silver (25% Ag) or palladium–ruthenium
membranes (2% Ru), respectively. The latter had a
length of 305 mm, an outer diameter of 6.35 mm and
a wall thickness of 254 m, whereas the former was
203 mm long and 3.2 mm thick and had a wall thick-
ness of 76 m. Both membranes were inserted in
stainless steel shells and sealed at the ends by ﬁtting
T junctions. The membrane tubes were packed with
0.5–1 g of a ﬁne-grained supported platinum catalyst
(0.52 wt.% Pt) diluted with pyrex particles of similar
grain size. Nitrogen was supplied as a sweep gas on
the shell side to establish the driving force for the
hydrogen permeation.
The performance of the membrane reactor turned
out to be strongly dependent on the ﬂow rates of the
reactants and the sweep gas. During isobutane dehy-
drogenation at 500◦C and atmospheric pressure, high
reactant ﬂow rates together with high sweep gas ﬂow
rates in the palladium–ruthenium membrane reactor
caused only a moderate increase of the conversion
over the equilibrium value of 32.4%; the catalyst ac-
tivity was more or less stable. Decreasing the reactant
ﬂow rate and increasing the sweep gas ﬂow rate led to
a rapid deactivation which could be traced back to a
complete removal of hydrogen from the packed-bed.
Under optimised conditions, i.e. at a low reactant ﬂow
rate of 1 ml/min and a moderate sweep gas ﬂow rate
of 230 ml/min a maximum conversion of 81.2% was
reached (total yield of butenes: 75.9%). Under these
conditions a small amount of hydrogen (below 1–2%)
remained on the tube side which is believed to acceler-
ate the reaction rate and to stabilise the catalyst against
carbon deposition. The hydrogen level was found to
be critical for the performance of the catalyst: too
high hydrogen concentrations inhibit the reaction rate,
whereas too low hydrogen concentrations lead to an
accelerated deactivation.

163
This behaviour was even more pronounced during
the dehydrogenation of propane, most likely because
of the higher reaction temperature of 550–570◦C.
Compared to the equilibrium propylene yield of 32%
at 550◦C and atmospheric pressure, the propylene
yield in the palladium–ruthenium membrane reactor
operated at a reactant ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min reached
70%. The yield declined more rapidly with time in
the palladium–silver membrane reactor than in the
palladium–ruthenium membrane reactor, which was
attributed to the faster hydrogen removal (lower wall
thickness and higher membrane area per unit volume)
accelerating the deactivation rate of the membrane and
the catalyst. Moreover, the initial propylene yield was
also lower in the palladium–silver membrane reactor,
which was explained by an inhibition of the reaction
rate at inﬁnitely small hydrogen concentrations. At
550◦C and atmospheric pressure the palladium–silver
membrane reactor gave only 47.5% propylene yield as
opposed to 70% with the palladium–ruthenium mem-
brane under similar conditions. The authors showed
that under optimised conditions, i.e. at low reactant
ﬂow rates and moderate sweep gas ﬂow rates, when
a sufﬁcient amount of hydrogen is still present on the
packed-bed side, the membrane reactor can maintain
a rather constant propylene yield over a period of
50–100 h. Under more severe conditions the activity
of the catalyst and the hydrogen ﬂux through the
membrane both decline more quickly as a matter of
the deactivation by carbon deposition. Concerning the
membrane it was demonstrated that the deposits on
the surface can be removed and the original hydrogen
ﬂux can be restored by a treatment in a hydrogen-rich
atmosphere at temperatures around 500◦C. Unfortu-
nately, the catalyst cannot be fully regenerated by this
treatment.
Both for isobutane and propane dehydrogenation
it was demonstrated that working at elevated pres-
sure (222 and 788 kPa) suppresses the equilibrium
conversion but at the same time enhances the hydro-
gen ﬂux through the membrane. The consequence
is that the equilibrium shift is more pronounced at
higher pressure even though the absolute conversion
of the membrane reactor is still a little bit lower than
at atmospheric pressure. However, high pressure on
the packed-bed side can be interesting because this
allows to work without sweep gas and provides pure
hydrogen. Simulations were carried out based on the
measured kinetics of the reaction and the permeation
to identify an optimum set of operating parameters
for the membrane reactor. The results conﬁrmed that
working at elevated pressure may lead to similar
propylene yields than at atmospheric pressure but not
to an increase of the propylene yield. Moreover, it
became clear that as long as thick-walled commer-
cial membranes are used a signiﬁcant increase of the
propylene yield can be expected only at low reac-
tant ﬂow rates, i.e. space velocities in the range of
LHSV = 0.1–0.15 h−1, which are about 5–10 times
below those used in industrial units. High yields at
higher space velocities would require membranes
with much better hydrogen ﬂuxes, e.g. thin-walled
palladium composite membranes.
Collins et al. [32] performed studies on propane
dehydrogenation
in
different
membrane
reactors
equipped with thin-ﬁlm microporous silica-based
membranes or with palladium composite membranes
at industrially relevant space velocities of LHSV =
2–12 h−1 and temperatures in the range of 500–575◦C.
The membranes were developmental membranes, i.e.
the palladium composite membranes had a higher hy-
drogen permeance than commercial palladium alloy
tubes and the silica-based membranes showed higher
selectivities than commercial ceramic membranes.
The palladium membranes were made by electroless
plating. Commercial tubular alumina microﬁltration
membranes of 10 mm o.d. and 7 mm i.d. served as sup-
ports. The palladium coating was placed on the inner
side and had a thickness of about 12 m. The catalyst
was a platinum-loaded aluminosilicate molecular sieve
(Amoco Corp.), which was packed inside the mem-
brane. The tube-side pressure during the membrane
reactor experiments was around 100 kPa, whereas the
shell side pressure was 90.5 kPa. The reactor feed con-
sisted either of pure propane or a mixture of 80%
propane and 20% hydrogen. Nitrogen was used as a
sweep gas, and the ratio of the inlet sweep gas ﬂow to
the propane feed ﬂow was varied between 2 and 8.
The hydrogen permeance of the palladium com-
posite membrane was measured with pure gases at
the beginning. Then a membrane reactor experiment
was carried out with a mixed propane/hydrogen feed
(80/20) at a space velocity of LHSV = 2.26 h−1 and
a ﬁxed sweep gas to feed ratio of 2. The temperature
was initially set to 500◦C and afterwards increased in
steps of 25 K up to 575◦C with 3 h holding time in
164

each case. During the experiment the hydrogen perme-
ance was determined in order to check the membrane
performance. It was surprisingly found that the perme-
ance decreased at higher temperatures. Moreover, the
membrane was deactivated when exposed to reaction
conditions. In the membrane reactor the palladium
membrane showed a lower hydrogen permeance than
a silica-based membrane even though its initial hy-
drogen permeance was higher. It was also noticed that
after the temperature had been raised to 525◦C the
leakage rates of propane and propylene increased sig-
niﬁcantly. SEM micrographs later showed small holes
in the surface of the palladium layer which proved
that the membrane was not stable under these con-
ditions. At 500◦C when the palladium layer was still
intact the membrane reactor gave a propylene yield
of about 16% compared to 12% obtained in a conven-
tional packed-bed reactor under the same conditions
(the calculated equilibrium conversion for a feed with
20% hydrogen and 80% propane is 10.5%). At higher
temperatures the yield increase over the conventional
reactor gradually diminished, which was explained
by the reduced hydrogen permeance. At 575◦C no
difference in the propylene yield was found between
the palladium membrane reactor and the conventional
reactor. The selectivity to propylene was generally
above 97%. No marked differences of the selectivity
were found between the membrane reactors and the
conventional reactor. In additional experiments the
authors noticed a formation of carbon deposits on the
palladium surface during contact with propane (no
hydrogen added) at high temperature, and in particu-
lar, when propylene was present. They also found in
permeation experiments that an addition of propylene
reduces the hydrogen ﬂux signiﬁcantly. These obser-
vations led them to a preliminary explanation for the
failure of the membrane, that carbon deposition from
propylene ﬁrst causes a deactivation of the palladium
surface and then the incorporation of carbon into the
palladium ﬁlm, or rather the stress associated with
this, leads to the formation of pinholes.
The authors also studied the deactivation behaviour
of the catalyst in the membrane reactor (silica-based
membranes). The deactivation in the membrane reac-
tor proved to be faster than in a conventional reactor
if most of the produced hydrogen was removed by
the membrane, e.g. over a period of less than 9 h
at 550◦C and LHSV = 3 h−1 the propylene yield
decreased from 39.6 to 31.5%. However, when oper-
ated at higher space velocities and with a lower sweep
gas to feed ratio the deactivation rate was reduced to
the same level as in the conventional reactor, if not
below. Hence, it seems possible by proper choice of
the process parameters that the membrane reactor can
maintain a higher propylene yield than a conventional
reactor over the whole dehydrogenation cycle.
Weyten et al. also studied propane dehydrogenation
in membrane reactors equipped with silica composite
membranes [91] and with a palladium–silver compos-
ite membrane, respectively [74]. The palladium–silver
membrane was obtained from Johnson Matthey and
is said to be commercially available. It was a tubu-
lar membrane of 25 mm o.d., cut to 200 mm length,
which had a 7.5 m thick palladium–silver ﬁlm on
the outer surface of an asymmetric alumina sup-
port with 2 mm wall thickness. The palladium–silver
ﬁlm was prepared by electroless plating, and the
effective membrane area was 140 cm2. A conven-
tional chromia-alumina catalyst with a grain size of
0.2–0.5 mm was packed inside the membrane tube
(total amount 21 g). Experiments were performed
with undiluted propane at 500◦C and atmospheric
pressure on the tube and shell side. An inert sweep
gas (nitrogen) served to establish the driving force for
the hydrogen permeation.
The membrane reactor reached propane conver-
sions above the equilibrium level of about 18% only if
the space velocity was lower than WHSV = 0.8 h−1.
The selectivity to propylene was generally between 85
and 95%. It was always higher than in a conventional
packed-bed reactor under the same operating condi-
tions. This is explained by a reduced extent of cracking
reactions producing methane and C2-hydrocarbons
if hydrogen is removed. At extremely low space
velocities in the range of WHSV = 0.05–0.1 h−1
propane conversions of 60–80% were detected, but
under these conditions the growing inﬂuence of the
cracking reactions caused a reduced propylene se-
lectivity. If the space velocity was increased above
WHSV = 0.8 h−1 the membrane reactor gave only
the equilibrium conversion, indicating that the perfor-
mance was controlled by the thermodynamics, i.e. the
permeation rate of hydrogen was too slow compared
to the rate of hydrogen generation.
It should be mentioned that the propane conversions
reported were calculated from the mole fractions of
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
165
propane in the feed and the retentate stream, i.e. Xi =
1 −xi/x0
i , which is true only if the number of moles
does not change during the reaction. In a conventional
reactor without removal of hydrogen the total number
of moles increases linearly with conversion. Hence, for
a pure propane feed a conversion of Xi = 0.5 deter-
mined from the decrease of the mole fraction is equiv-
alent to a true conversion between 0.25 (no hydrogen
removal) and 0.5 (removal of the entire hydrogen).
The deactivation of the catalyst was not studied in
detail. The authors just noted that at 500◦C the cata-
lyst was stable for at least 7 h before its activity grad-
ually decreased to 50% of the initial value after 30 h,
and that it can be easily regenerated by burning off
the coke at 500◦C overnight in a mixture of 4% oxy-
gen in nitrogen. The membrane apparently was stable
under the operating conditions tested, i.e. neither a de-
crease of the hydrogen permeance nor a reduction of
the separation factor was reported.
Yildirim et al. [31] compared the performance of
different membrane reactors for dehydrogenation of
propane, i.e. dense palladium–silver composite mem-
branes and asymmetric porous alumina membranes
with incorporated palladium clusters. The porous
alumina membranes were modiﬁed by silica depo-
sition and subsequent impregnation with palladium
chloride. After washing and drying the membranes
were treated under hydrogen ﬂow at 400◦C in or-
der to reduce the palladium chloride to metallic
palladium. The dense palladium–silver membrane
was prepared by magnetron sputtering on a tubular
porous Vycor glass membrane (10 mm o.d., 200 mm
length, 1.1 mm wall thickness and 4 nm pore size)
and had a palladium thickness above 4 m. The tubes
were packed with 2.55 g of either 0.5 wt.% Pt/Al2O3
or 0.5 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 cylindrical catalyst pellets
(3.4 mm × 3.6 mm). In case of the palladium–silver
membrane 18.5 cm2 membrane area were available
per gram of catalyst. With this membrane experiments
were carried out only at a temperature of 400◦C.
Higher temperatures were avoided to prevent carbon
deposition. Different sweep gases were applied, i.e.
nitrogen, carbon monoxide and air. The space veloc-
ity, as calculated from the speciﬁed propane concen-
tration at the inlet, the ﬂow rate and the given catalyst
amount, was in the range of WHSV = 0.7 h−1. The
transmembrane pressure difference during the exper-
iments is not given, but it is stated that without a
sweep gas only a moderate increase of the conversion
was detected. With nitrogen as a sweep gas the mem-
brane reactor gave a propane conversion of 17.5%.
The conversion was further increased to 38% when
a mixture of carbon monoxide and nitrogen (11%
CO) was used, and with air as reactive sweep gas a
propane conversion of 51% was detected. Although
measurements of the hydrogen concentration in the
efﬂuent from the packed-bed side are not given, these
results demonstrate that the palladium surface can be
utilised to react the permeated hydrogen with a sweep
gas so that a high driving force for the permeation is
established.
The long-term behaviour of the membrane under
reaction conditions was not studied in detail, but per-
meation experiments with temperature cycling proved
that the membrane was stable.
Quicker [61] also studied propane dehydrogena-
tion in a palladium composite membrane reactor. The
membranes were prepared by electroless plating on
asymmetric porous ceramic tubes and by a combined
electroless/electroplating on asymmetric porous sin-
tered stainless steel tubes. The stainless steel tubes
were alternatively coated by thermal spraying of pal-
ladium powder (high-velocity oxy-fuel ﬂame spraying
(HVOF)). Both types of supports had a similar geom-
etry, i.e. 10 mm o.d., 110 mm length and 1.5–2 mm
wall thickness. The palladium coating on the alumina
support was placed on the tube side and was 2–3 m
thick, whereas the palladium layer on the sintered
stainless steel support was placed on the shell side
and had a thickness of roughly 8 m (plating) and
60–70 m (HVOF), respectively. The membrane tube
and a surrounding dense tube (alumina or stainless
steel) of 21 mm i.d. were inserted into a stainless
steel jacket and screwed up with the help of two
stainless steel ﬂanges connected to the gas lines (cf.
Fig. 4). Graphite gaskets were used for sealing the
tubes to the ﬂanges. An amount of 17 gramme of
a chromia-alumina catalyst (Linde AG, grain size
0.8–1.0 mm) was placed in the annular space between
the membrane tube and the dense tube. Dehydro-
genation experiments were carried out at 560◦C and
pressures of 130 kPa on the packed-bed side and
110 kPa on the permeate side in each case over a pe-
riod of several hours. Pure propane was fed at a space
velocity of WHSV = 0.7 h−1, while nitrogen was em-
ployed as sweep gas. The ratio of the sweep gas linear
166
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
ﬂow velocity to the propane linear ﬂow velocity (i.e.
the normalised sweep gas ﬂow) ranged between 17
and 27.
The calculated equilibrium conversion of propane
at 130 kPa and 560◦C is 30.2%. In the conven-
tional packed-bed a conversion of 29.2% was de-
tected. The palladium–alumina membrane reactor
reached 34.7%. With the plated palladium–stainless
steel membrane 46.5% were achieved, and with the
palladium–stainless steel membrane prepared by
HVOF the conversion was 38.5%. Comparing the
propylene yields is more instructive: 22.4% were
reached in the conventional packed-bed, 27.8% with
the palladium–alumina membrane, 26.7% with the
plated palladium–stainless steel membrane and 25%
with the palladium–stainless steel membrane prepared
by HVOF. Two things are apparent from this: ﬁrst the
selectivity to propylene was lower than in the com-
mercial process (>90–95%) which is due to the lower
space velocity used. Second the selectivity to propy-
lene was much lower with the stainless steel-based
membranes than with the palladium–alumina mem-
brane. The amount of gaseous side products (mainly
C1 and C2 hydrocarbons) was similar in all experi-
ments so that the reason was an enhanced carbon de-
position on the membrane, which was witnessed also
by a decline of the hydrogen permeance with time.
Similar observations were described by Sheintuch
and Dessau [90]. The carbon deposition rate found
with the palladium–stainless steel membranes was
ﬁve times higher than with the palladium–alumina
membrane. The latter was similar to the carbon de-
position rate in the conventional packed-bed. The
distribution
of
the
produced
hydrogen
between
the retentate and permeate side reveals that the
palladium–stainless steel membranes were able to re-
cover a larger fraction of hydrogen (plated: 68% and
HVOF: 59%) compared to the palladium–alumina
membrane (38%). The lower hydrogen concentra-
tion in the retentate can be one reason for the in-
creased carbon deposition rate, but it is more likely
that the different location of the palladium layer is
responsible. The palladium layer was adjacent to
the catalyst bed in case of the palladium–alumina
membrane and near the catalyst in case of the
palladium–stainless steel membranes. The regenera-
tion of the composite membranes by oxidation was
not studied.
The experimental results obtained on the dehydro-
genation of propane in palladium-based membrane re-
actors may be altogether summarised as follows.
At low space velocities conversions well above
the equilibrium level have been obtained both with
thick-walled palladium alloy membranes and with
palladium or palladium–silver thin-ﬁlms supported on
porous glass or porous ceramic tubes. Thick-walled
palladium alloy membranes do not allow sufﬁcient
hydrogen ﬂuxes to achieve a signiﬁcant conversion
increase at industrially used space velocities, e.g.
WHSV = 1.2–2.0 h−1. With thin-ﬁlm palladium alloy
membranes prepared by electroless plating promising
results have been obtained, but the permeance still
limited the performance of the membrane reactor at
space velocities above WHSV = 0.8 h−1. This indi-
cates that higher membrane areas or thin-ﬁlm mem-
branes with better hydrogen permeances are required.
It is also possible that the permeance in the mem-
brane reactor is reduced to some extent by adsorption
of reactants or poisoning of the membrane surface
(carbon deposition).
Thick-walled palladium alloy membranes have
shown reasonable stability against high tempera-
ture and the reactant atmospheres, in some studies
with thin palladium or palladium alloy ﬁlms de-
posited by electroless plating stability problems have
been encountered at temperatures above 400–500◦C.
Coke deposition initiated by propylene is suspected
to cause pinholes in these layers due to incorpora-
tion of carbon. However, other studies using similar
membranes gave no indications of membrane fail-
ure, though carried out at temperatures below 500◦C
and for short-term only. Generally, little informa-
tion is available about the long-term performance of
thin-ﬁlm palladium-based membranes used in mem-
brane reactors for alkane dehydrogenation. Moreover,
the service life of the catalysts at hydrogen depleted
conditions is not sufﬁciently clear.
All three options to generate the necessary driv-
ing force for hydrogen permeation, i.e. inert sweep
gas, transmembrane pressure difference, and reactive
sweep gas have been proved in the lab-scale in prin-
ciple. However, in most studies inert sweep gas or a
transmembrane pressure difference are applied. The
use of a reactive sweep gas, which could provide the
heat for the endothermic reaction, is less well demon-
strated, in particular because in all cases small tubes

167
have been used where the heat management is not
critical.
2.4.5.4. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.
Another reaction of great industrial importance is the
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene which has
served as a model reaction for the use of equilibrium
shift membrane reactors in many simulation studies.
However, experimental work on membrane reactors
for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the past fo-
cused mainly on commercial porous membranes with
Knudsen-type separation behaviour. Only recently
experiments using palladium composite membranes
for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene were reported.
Quicker et al. [60,61] used palladium–alumina mem-
branes prepared by electroless plating (2–3 m layer
thickness) in the same reactor as reported in the
previous section. The reactor was ﬁlled with 20 g
of a commercial iron oxide catalyst (Süd-Chemie
AG, grain size 0.8–1.0 mm) and was operated at
580◦C with a space velocity of WHSV = 1 h−1 and
a steam to ethylbenzene ratio of S/O = 2:1 kg/kg.
The retentate pressure was set to 110 kPa while the
permeate pressure was kept at 100 kPa. Nitrogen was
employed as a sweep gas. The normalised sweep gas
ﬂow ranged from 0 to 105. It was demonstrated that
the conversion of ethylbenzene was increased from
39 to 45% at the maximum sweep gas ﬂow while
the selectivity to styrene was constant at 93–93.5%.
The calculated equilibrium conversion at these con-
ditions is 71.7%. The analysis of the hydrogen split
between the retentate and the permeate at the reactor
exit showed that even at the highest sweep gas ﬂow
only about 1/4 of the produced hydrogen was in fact
transported through the membrane. This suggests a
limitation by the permeance. However, at present no
concluding statement can be made because data are
not yet available from experiments at different space
velocities and in the above experiments the equilib-
rium conversion was not reached.
She et al. [92] used a palladium composite stainless
steel membrane to enhance the dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene by removal of hydrogen in a membrane
reactor. The membrane had a 20 m thick palladium
layer and an effective membrane area of 75 cm2. Argon
was used as sweep gas at ambient pressure. At 550◦C
and 120 kPa with a steam to oil ratio of 6.8 the conven-
tional reactor reached a conversion of 35%, whereas
the membrane reactor achieved 45%. The space veloc-
ity and the amount of hydrogen removed is not given
in [92], but the calculation of the equilibrium conver-
sion for the experimental conditions applied (51.7%)
indicates a similar situation as in the experiments per-
formed by Quicker [61].
Hence, it must be stated that the experimental results
obtained so far on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in
palladium composite membrane reactors are still very
limited. No supra-equilibrium conversions have been
reported. The main question once more in this appli-
cation is the stability of the membranes against the
reactant atmosphere (steam, styrene) at high temper-
atures. Moreover, it has to be demonstrated at which
space velocities the equilibrium conversion can be
surpassed.
This leads to the ﬁnal conclusion that the main
problem for the experimental investigations still is
the non-availability of membranes that can with-
stand the required temperatures and gas atmospheres.
Thick-walled palladium alloy tubes have shown good
performance at low space velocities and also a rea-
sonable stability mainly in model dehydrogenation
reactions, but for real applications they have no per-
spective due to the high palladium price and the low
permeance. Despite obvious progress in the prepara-
tion and characterisation of thin-ﬁlm palladium and
palladium alloy membranes the experimental work
applying these membranes to industrially relevant de-
hydrogenation reactions is still in its infancy. The few
available results from experiments in membrane re-
actors under realistic process conditions indicate that
these membranes are susceptible to pinhole formation
at high temperatures and to failure by carbon deposi-
tion, in particular under hydrogen depleted conditions.
The membranes are not commercially available on a
regular basis, and with very few exceptions (e.g. [36]),
all the experimental investigations have been carried
out in the lab-scale. It is not clear how membranes
with larger areas can be produced economically, and
at the present price of palladium already a 1 m
thick palladium layer would cost about 400–450 /m2
(without support). Because 1 m thickness is proba-
bly not sufﬁcient for a stable and defect-free mem-
brane this means that such a technology-provided it
can be successfully demonstrated-is interesting only
for valuable products or when a compact design
(‘intensiﬁed process’) is of foremost importance.

3. Membrane reactors based on porous
catalytic membranes with dispersed palladium
Porous membranes with built-in catalytic compo-
nents are catalytic membranes in the true sense of the
word. They can be employed in a reactor in various
ways, which may be classiﬁed into the following three
categories:
1. Forced ﬂow of (pre-mixed) reactants through the
membrane.
2. Co-current or counter-current ﬂow of two reac-
tant streams on opposite sides of the membrane
with permeation of all species across the membrane
(non-permselective).
3. Co-current or counter-current ﬂow of two reactant
streams or a feed stream and a sweep stream on
opposite sides of the membrane with selective per-
meation of particular species across the membrane.
The most simple is conﬁguration (1) which is
not a membrane reactor in the strict sense of the
IUPAC-deﬁnition because it has no separation by the
membrane. The contact time per pass in such a design
is usually short. Hence, the reaction has to be very
fast or the reactants have to be passed through the
membrane many times, e.g. by applying a reactant
recycle.
Conﬁguration (2) stands for the CNMR-concept,
i.e. the membrane provides a deﬁned interface for the
reaction of the two feed streams. Here, the reaction

capillary pressure is equal to the pressure difference between the gas and the liquid.
has to be very fast too because a breakthrough of the
respective species to the opposite side is unwanted.
Conﬁguration (3) certainly is the most relevant
one with regard to catalytic membrane reactors. It
requires a permselective membrane. However, in a
gas–liquid reaction permselective transport through
the membrane can occur also when the gas–liquid in-
terface is arranged inside the porous membrane. Such
a concept may be called catalytic diffuser and is of
general applicability in fast solid-catalysed gas–liquid
reactions. Liquid-phase hydrogenation on palladium
catalysts represents an industrially important class of
reactions that falls into this category.
3.1. Working principle of a catalytic diffuser
In the catalytic diffuser a gas stream and a liq-
uid stream are supplied on opposite sides of a porous
membrane with good wettability. The membrane has
an asymmetric structure with the coarse support on
the gas side and the ﬁne layer on the liquid side. Due
to the capillary forces the liquid is sucked into the
pores of the ﬁne layer. The liquid is stopped at the
point where the capillary pressure, that depends on
the pore size and the pore geometry, is equalled by
the pressure difference between the gas side and the
liquid side (cf. Fig. 27). The catalyst is placed on the
pore walls of the ﬁne layer, e.g. in the form of highly
dispersed clusters, whereas the support has no cata-
lyst inside. A uniform pore size of the ﬁne layer is

beneﬁcial because this allows a good control of the
location of the phase boundary. The total effective area
of the gas–liquid interface is of the order of the mem-
brane surface area.
The gas diffuses through the coarse support and is
taken up by the liquid at the gas–liquid interface. The
dissolved gas then diffuses through the liquid-ﬁlled
pores of the ﬁne layer towards the liquid side. The
reaction between dissolved gas and the liquid or dis-
solved species in the liquid occurs at the active clusters
on the pore walls. The reaction products diffuse out
towards the liquid side following the pressure gradi-
ent. Typical concentration proﬁles of the gaseous and
liquid reactants inside the catalytic layer are shown
in Fig. 28 together with concentrations proﬁles that
would be obtained in a conventional suspended cat-
alyst particle. The following advantages of the cat-
alytic diffuser compared to a suspended catalyst may
be summarised:
• The catalyst is immobilised in the membrane, i.e. no
ﬁne catalyst particles have to be used. The catalytic
layer can be made thin enough so that pore diffusion
limitation is avoided.
• The two reactants can be supplied from opposite
sides to the catalytic region, that is the supply rates
can be controlled independently of each other. In
particular the gas pressure can be varied between
the bubble point pressure of the support and that of
the ﬁne layer. This allows to adjust the gas supply
rate to the (varying) needs of the reaction.
• Auxiliary substances can be supplied directly to the
catalytic region without passing through the bulk
liquid (avoiding possible mass transfer limitations).
• No saturator is required before the reactor to dis-
solve the gas in the liquid.
• Even if the solubility of the gas in the liquid is poor
high pressure is not required in the reactor because
the gas is supplied directly to the region where it is
consumed.
3.2. Application of catalytic diffusers to the
hydrogenation of nitrate in water
The hydrogenation of nitrate in water on bimetal-
lic palladium-based catalysts has been ﬁrst proposed
more than a decade ago by Vorlop and co-workers as
an alternative method for nitrate removal from ground-
water and surface water [93–96]. Based on this work
a process called ‘catalytic nitrate reduction’ was de-
veloped by Solvay Umweltchemie GmbH, Hannover
(Germany) [97]. A comprehensive review of the pro-
cess development from the beginning until today has
been provided recently by Lecloux [98]. He describes
the catalyst development at the lab scale including
kinetics and molecular modelling equally like chemi-
cal engineering aspects such as mass transfer and re-
actor design until to practical difﬁculties that were
170
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
encountered in ﬁeld tests. Details on the preparation
and the performance of bimetallic catalysts used for
nitrate reduction in water are reported in another con-
tribution to the present volume by Prüße, who gives
also an introduction to the general background of ni-
trate reduction in water. The most important features
of the reaction are brieﬂy summarised below.
Nitrate ions are reduced by hydrogen via a number
of successive reactions until to the target product ni-
trogen. The reaction mechanism has not been cleared
in all aspects but the main features are widely accepted
including that nitrate is ﬁrst converted to nitrite before
in a second step two parallel reaction pathways occur,
one leading to nitrogen and the other to ammonium
[96,99–103]. Eqs. (18)–(20) denote the stoichiometry
of these transformations.
NO2−+ H2 →NO2−+ H2O
(18)
2NO2−+ 3H2 →N2 + 2OH−+ 2H2O
(19)
NO2−+ 3H2 →NH4+ + 2OH−
(20)
It is assumed that in the second step the reaction ac-
tually proceeds via nitrous oxide which is adsorbed
on the catalyst surface before the branching to ammo-
nium ions and nitrogen takes place. Moreover, dini-
trogen monoxide has been identiﬁed as an intermedi-
ate product of the formation of nitrogen [104–106]. A
widely accepted reaction scheme based on this reﬁned
stoichiometry is outlined in Fig. 29.
Fig. 29. Reaction scheme and stoichiometry of the hydrogenation of nitrate in water on Pd-Cu and Pd-Sn catalysts [102].
Experiments have shown that for the hydrogena-
tion of nitrate on palladium a second metal is nec-
essary, preferably Cu, Sn or In. In contrast nitrite
is hydrogenated also on monometallic palladium
[98,102,103], even more selectively than on bimetallic
palladium catalysts [103,107]. Mixtures of bimetallic
Pd-Cu catalysts and monometallic palladium catalysts
have shown a lower ammonium formation than the
bimetallic Pd-Cu catalysts alone [101,103]. Compared
to Pd-Sn and Pd-In, Pd-Cu catalysts suffer from a
higher formation of nitrite as well as from signiﬁcant
amounts of dinitrogen monoxide [98,105,106,108].
Since indium is less common, Pd-Sn seems to be the
favourite catalyst system at present.
The
activity
and
selectivity
of
the
catalysts
is strongly dependent on the reaction conditions
[102,103,109], ﬁrst of all on the pH value but also on
the concentration of dissolved hydrogen, on the tem-
perature and on the nitrate concentration. A high pH
value is connected to a poor nitrate removal rate and
to a high formation of ammonium. Total saturation
of the water with hydrogen gives a high reaction rate
but raises to some extent the formation of ammonium
[110,111]. Higher temperatures speed up the reaction
rate but the formation of ammonium gains most. The
selectivity also depends on the nitrate concentration,
i.e. a lower concentration of nitrate is in favour of
ammonium formation.
In view of the catalyst, the support material, the
palladium loading, the ratio of palladium to the
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
171
promoter, the size of the metal clusters and the oxida-
tion state of the metals are important for activity and
selectivity. We also added the particle size and the pore
structure of the support (porosity and pore size distri-
bution) [109]. In most studies -alumina supports or
silica supports have been used [98,103,110] but zir-
conia supports were employed as well [111,112]. The
demands on the support are manifold. It must provide
a reasonably large inner surface area for deposition of
the active metals. To facilitate the diffusion the parti-
cle size must be small enough, and a high pore volume
together with a sufﬁcient fraction of macropores is re-
quired. Moreover, the support must be stable against
attrition and hydrolysis.
The palladium loading, the palladium to promoter
ratio and the particle size of the metals are connected.
For each promoter there exists an optimum ratio be-
cause the catalyst should have bimetallic metal clus-
ters and monometallic palladium clusters side by side
[108,110]. The former are needed to convert nitrate
while the latter are more active and selective in con-
verting nitrite. The metal loading and the cluster size
together determine the available metal surface area. A
high metal surface area in general gives a high reac-
tion rate (if no structure sensitivity of the reaction is
observed), but the available inner surface area of the
support sets a limit. If the metal loading is too high the
average cluster size grows. Hence, an optimum palla-
dium loading exists where the activity per milligram
of palladium reaches a maximum.
The inﬂuence of the particle size is connected to the
formation of hydroxyl anions as the reaction proceeds.
If the diffusion inside the catalyst particles is too slow
compared to the reaction the produced hydroxyl an-
ions cannot diffuse out fast enough. The consequence
is a local pH-increase which reduces the activity and
favours the formation of ammonium [102,113]. This
can be largely avoided by using extremely ﬁne cata-
lyst particles of a few microns [101]. Moreover, it was
shown that pH gradients can be suppressed also by
supplying carbon dioxide [98] or by replacing hydro-
gen as a reducing agent with formic acid [114,115].
Formic acid is decomposed at the catalyst generating
hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The released hydrogen
reacts with the nitrate while carbon dioxide serves as
a buffering agent. Carbon dioxide is readily soluble
in water and forms carbonic acid, which in turn dis-
sociates to bicarbonate anions and hydronium ions. A
second dissociation equilibrium is effective giving car-
bonate anions and hydronium ions. Hydronium ions
and hydroxyl anions neutralise each other by forming
water. Due to the high solubility of carbon dioxide a
large amount of hydroxyl anions can be neutralised
and so the local pH value remains constant. However,
while pH-gradients inside the catalyst may be sup-
pressed by buffering the water with carbon dioxide
or by working with formic acid, concentration gra-
dients of nitrate and hydrogen which also occur can
be avoided only by using ﬁne catalyst particles (or
egg-shell catalysts). Since, ﬁne catalyst particles are
difﬁcult to operate on a technical scale attempts have
been made to immobilise the catalyst in membranes
or in particles with optimised diffusion properties.
• Lüdtke et al. [116] developed catalytic membranes
by embedding ﬁne catalyst particles in porous
polyetherimide membranes (hollow ﬁbres, sheets).
The water was saturated with hydrogen and then
passed through the membrane in cross-ﬂow. Due
to the short contact time per pass a product recycle
was applied.
• Hähnlein et al. [104,117] packed ﬁne catalyst parti-
cles into polymer hollow ﬁbres arranged in a hollow
ﬁbre module. The water was saturated with hydro-
gen and then fed to the shell side of the module.
• Prüße et al. [108,118] used ﬁne catalyst particles en-
capsulated in polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL) hydrogels.
The PVAL particles were employed in a conven-
tional reactor with hydrogen saturated feed water.
• Ilinitch et al. [100,119] used asymmetric macro-
porous alumina membranes as supports. Impreg-
nation methods were applied to deposit the active
metals inside the membrane structure. The catalytic
membranes were employed in cross-ﬂow with hy-
drogen saturated water and product recycle similar
as in the concept of Lüdtke et al. [116].
We too have proposed asymmetric macroporous ce-
ramic membranes as supports for bimetallic palladium
catalysts for nitrate reduction in water [120,121]. This
concept was studied in a European research project
aimed at the development of catalytic membranes for
nitrate removal from drinking water. The active metals
were deposited in the ﬁne top layer of the membranes.
However, in contrast to the approach followed by Ilin-
itch we operate the membrane as a catalytic diffuser,
that is, it serves not only as catalyst support but also as
172
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
a dosing device for hydrogen or mixtures of hydrogen
and carbon monoxide. The beneﬁt is a better control
of the reaction rate and the selectivity. First results of
a membrane screening were reported elsewhere [120]
as well as information on the preparation of the mem-
branes by metal organic chemical vapour deposition
(MOCVD) [121]. In this paper an overview of the ex-
perimental results is provided.
3.3. Experimental
3.3.1. Membrane supports
Asymmetric porous alumina membranes obtained
from HITK e.V., Hermsdorf (Germany), were used as
starting materials. The membranes had an outer di-
ameter of 10 mm and an inner diameter of 7 mm and
were cut to a length of 100–120 mm for the prepa-
ration and the tests in the membrane reactor. They
consist of a coarse -alumina support, up to two in-
termediate layers with graded pore size (-alumina)
and a thin top layer made of -alumina, -alumina,
titania or zirconia. The top layer was always on the
shell side. Its thickness and pore diameter was varied,
i.e. -alumina layers were used with pore diameters
of 60–400 nm and thicknesses of 10–50 m. The zir-
conia layers had a pore diameter of 65 nm and thick-
nesses of 10–20 m. The titania and -alumina layers
were 0.5 m thick and had a pore size of 5 nm. All
membranes were handled carefully in order to avoid
damage of the sensitive top layers.
3.3.2. Preparation methods for placing the
catalytic metals in the membrane top layer
To introduce the active metals palladium and tin
into the membrane top layer different techniques were
used. Initially a very simple impregnation method
was applied [120]. In this method a membrane is put
on-centre on a rotating shaft. While rotating at 15 rpm
the membrane is attached carefully to the surface of a
bath containing the metal salts. The bath was prepared
by dissolving 166 mg PdNO3 or 40 mg SnCl2·2H2O
in 20 ml twice-distilled water with a few drops of
concentrated hydrochloric acid added while gently
heating. At a bath temperature of 60◦C the impreg-
nation is carried out for about 10 min. Afterwards the
membrane is dried in a drying oven at 90◦C for 15 min
(air) and burned in a laboratory furnace at 400◦C for
90 min in air to convert the deposited metal salts into
tenacious metal oxides. In the next step the weight
increase is determined and it is decided whether a
second impregnation step is necessary to achieve the
desired metal loading. The deposition of the metals is
carried out sequentially. At the end the membrane is
burned in air at 500◦C in the furnace for 2 h before it is
reduced in a hydrogen–nitrogen atmosphere at 350◦C
for 3 h to obtain the metals in zero oxidation state.
MOCVD was applied as an alternative preparation
method using Pd(II)(hfac)2 and Sn(II)(hfac)2 as pre-
cursors [121]. The deposition was also carried out se-
quentially. In case of palladium a pure helium stream
is passed through a bed of glass beads containing the
palladium precursor which is heated to 80◦C. Deposi-
tion of tin requires a sublimator temperature of 120◦C
and a mixture of hydrogen and helium as carrier gas
to receive tin in reduced form. The gas stream carry-
ing the precursor vapour is then fed to a heated-wall
CVD reactor containing the membrane in central po-
sition with the interior sealed so that the precursor
can penetrate into the membrane structure only from
the shell side. The reactor is kept at 240–250◦C and
50 kPa while the deposition is carried out for a pre-
determined time (derived from the average deposition
rate). Calcination and reduction of the prepared mem-
branes is not necessary in MOCVD because the metals
are received in reduced form.
About 60 different membranes were prepared ac-
cording to both methods and tested in screening ex-
periments for their ability to reduce nitrate selectively
to nitrogen. The results showed that Pd-Sn on zirconia
supports gives the best results. To be able to make a
larger number of these membranes with reproducible
properties a more sophisticated impregnation appara-
tus based on a rotational evaporator was designed and
built at Venezia Tecnologie, Porto Marghera (Italy),
one of the partners in the European project. The mem-
branes from this method were calcined and reduced
after the same treatment as the membranes prepared
by the simple impregnation technique.
3.3.3. Structural characterisation
The methods applied for characterisation of the
structure of the membrane top layers before and after
introduction of the catalytic metals, i.e. the pore size,
the distribution of the metals and the metal cluster size
are described elsewhere [121]. The pore size distribu-
tion was measured with a capillary ﬂow porometer.

The distribution of the metals was determined by elec-
tron probe microanalysis (EPMA/WDX) performed
on cross-sectional cuts from different radial and axial
positions. The metal cluster size was analysed mainly
by X-ray diffraction (XRD/LBA). In addition XPS
investigations were carried out at the University of
Louvain (Belgium), another project partner, to quan-
tify the palladium to promoter ratio on the catalyst
surface.
3.3.4. Catalytic tests
The performance of the catalytic membranes was
studied in a stirred-tank membrane reactor with a
capacity of 1000 ml (cf. Fig. 30). The reactor was
operated mainly in continuous mode. In this set-up
a membrane connected to the gas supply line at one
end is immersed in the liquid. The other end is sealed.
The liquid is mixed by a magnetically coupled blade
stirrer. An impeller can be used as well if a good
dispersion of the reactor gas in the liquid is desired.
However, this is not the case in the catalytic diffuser
mode where the gas is supplied to the catalytic layer
from inside the membrane tube while not exceeding
the bubble point pressure (i.e. no gas bubbles are in-
troduced). A mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide
is fed to the membrane. For this the desired amount
of carbon dioxide is set by a thermal mass ﬂow con-
troller. Hydrogen is fed with the help of a downstream
pressure controller which adjusts the hydrogen ﬂow so
that a given pressure inside the membrane is reached.
The reactor vessel consists of a double-walled glass
jacket screwed up between two metal ﬂanges. An
electrochemical hydrogen sensor ﬁxed in the bot-
tom ﬂange measures the hydrogen concentration in
the liquid. An immersed ﬁbre-optic oxygen sensor
is available to detect the concentration of dissolved
oxygen. The liquid feed is metered by a pulse-free
peristaltic pump, whereas the product is withdrawn by
a vacuum pump installed behind the product tank. Be-
fore entering the connecting pipe the product stream
passes a sintered metal ﬁlter to retain ﬁne particles.
If necessary the ﬁlter can be cleaned by backﬂushing
with hydrogen. For a match of the feed and product
ﬂow rates the vacuum pump is adjusted during the ex-
periment based on the reading of a balance recording
the combined weight of both tanks. Two separate ion
174
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
chromatographs (Metrohm AG, Filderstadt, Germany)
are available to analyse the concentration of the an-
ions (nitrate, nitrite) and cations (ammonium), respec-
tively. For measurements without carbon dioxide sup-
ply a pH-controller with dosage of hydrochloric acid
is available to maintain a constant pH value during the
reaction.
The mixing behaviour of the liquid in the reac-
tor corresponds to that of an ideal continuous stirred
tank reactor (CSTR), i.e. concentration gradients in
the reactor volume can be neglected. This was con-
ﬁrmed by tracer experiments performed before the
catalytic tests (displacement technique). No bypass-
ing and no signiﬁcant dead volume could be detected.
Therefore, the nitrate removal rate can be calculated
from the CSTR material balance (no volume change)
and is related unequivocally to the reactor concentra-
tions measured in the efﬂuent stream. The nitrate re-
moval rate is multiplied with the molecular weight
and divided by the palladium loading to give the spe-
ciﬁc activity of the membrane per unit weight of palla-
dium (mg NO3−/mg Pd h), which is an established cri-
terion for comparison of the performance of different
catalysts.

3.4. Results and discussion
3.4.1. Membrane screening
The top layer of the membrane has two functions.
It serves as a support for the active metals and as a
contacting region between gas phase and liquid phase.
The wetted top layer acts as a barrier for the gas phase,
i.e. the gas–liquid interface is established in the pore
structure beneath the top layer. This allows to supply
hydrogen directly and only to the catalytic region. By-
passing of gas through larger pores (i.e. defects) would
lead to the introduction of gas bubbles into the water
and is not desired. With reference to the ﬁrst function
the deposition of the metals is aimed at the following
features:
• high metal dispersion (small metal clusters);
• desired palladium loading (about 1–5 wt.% based
on the top layer);
• desired palladium/promoter ratio (for Pd-Sn catalyst
it is around 4);
• uniform distribution of the metals over the top layer;
• deposition of the metals only in the top layer.
Based on the present knowledge about the reaction
system this is expected to result in catalytic mem-
branes with good performance for reduction of nitrate.

For what concerns the second function, the screen-
ing was performed also to identify operating con-
ditions which allow to maximise the selectivity and
activity of the catalytic membranes. In this respect
the supply of carbon dioxide together with hydrogen
to the catalytic region leads to a much better catalytic
performance of the membranes. Hence, membranes
with different properties, e.g. prepared by different
methods, have to be compared under such operating
conditions. The particular advantage of supplying
carbon dioxide directly to the reaction zone is that the
pH value can be controlled inside the catalytic layer
without the need to saturate the whole reactor liquid.
Hence, the consumption of carbon dioxide is lower,
which also means that less bicarbonate/carbonate is
contained in the reactor efﬂuent.
3.4.1.1. Top-layer material, pore size and thickness.
Four different commercially available top-layer mate-
rials were considered, i.e. -alumina, -alumina, tita-
nia and zirconia. The -alumina and titania layers are
characterised by a small pore diameter of 5 nm and a
thickness of only 0.5 m. Two problems were encoun-
tered with these layers. Due to the small pore size dur-
ing the impregnation a major part of the metals was
deposited on top of the layer and not inside the pores.
A control of the deposition proved to be difﬁcult. Also
in MOCVD the deposition occurred largely on the sur-
face of the layer and was rather irregular. After re-
moval of the adherent metals the membranes showed
a poor activity because of the low absolute amount
of the catalytic metals. Moreover, it must be assumed
that the gas pressure of up to 700 kPa, which was ap-
plied in the experiments, was not sufﬁcient to bring
the gas–liquid interface close enough to the transition
from the intermediate layer to the top layer where the
catalyst is located. This is connected to a higher hy-
drogen mass transfer resistance. Note that, according
to Eq. (25) a cylindrical pore with 5 nm diameter has
a capillary pressure of 58 MPa at complete wetting
(σ = 72.7 mN/m at 20◦C, cos α = 1).

(25)
Due to these problems the investigations were concen-
trated on -alumina top layers which were available
with pore sizes of 60–400 nm, and with thicknesses
from 10 to 50 m, as well as on zirconia top layers
with 65 nm pore size and a thickness of 10–20 m.
These materials were applied successfully for the
impregnation and for MOCVD. With zirconia-based
Pd-Sn membrane catalysts prepared by MOCVD up
to 50% higher activities were detected compared to
-alumina at similar thickness and pore size of the top
layer and at comparable metal loading. At the same
time the selectivity to nitrogen was reduced only a
little, i.e. by not more than 10%.
The variation of the pore size of -alumina top
layers in the range of 60–400 nm caused a moder-
ate change of the speciﬁc activity of the Pd-Sn-based
membranes. At standard test conditions a weak maxi-
mum was noticed around 100 nm. The selectivity did
not show a maximum but was reduced slightly with
increasing pore size. However, the absolute changes
with the pore size are small compared to the ﬂuctua-
tions between the measurement points. The thickness
of the -alumina top layers proved to be more impor-
tant. For thicknesses up to 20 m the speciﬁc activity
at standard test conditions was between 0.8 and 1 mg
nitrate per mg palladium per hour. This value dropped

above (cf. [121]).
3.4.1.2. Preparation method.
Fig. 31 shows the de-
pendency of the palladium cluster size determined
by XRD/LBA on the palladium loading for differ-
ent membranes prepared by the simple impregnation
method, by MOCVD and by impregnation in the
rotational evaporator. Obviously the simple impreg-
nation leads to a lower dispersion than MOCVD,
whereas the modiﬁed impregnation in the rotational
evaporator gives a similar cluster sizes. Fig. 32 shows
an example of the palladium distribution over the
membrane cross-section obtained by the different
preparation methods. The proﬁles were determined
by EPMA/WDX line scans from three Pd-Sn/ZrO2
membranes with different palladium loading. The
palladium loading based on the weight of the top
layer is shown. Regardless of the different absolute
values a difference in the characteristics of the three
proﬁles is noticed. The simple impregnation gives
the sharpest proﬁle which corresponds to the desired
result; almost no palladium is found in the interme-
diate layer. MOCVD is a bit worse in view of the
percentage of the palladium that is trapped in the top
layer, and it shows a moderate decrease of the pal-
ladium concentration in the top layer inwards. The
impregnation in the rotational evaporator causes ﬂat
concentration proﬁles in the top layer, similar as the
Fig. 32. Palladium concentration proﬁles from EPMA/WDX over the cross-section of three zirconia-based Pd-Sn membranes prepared

simple impregnation method, but at the same time the
highest palladium concentration of the three methods
in the intermediate layer. What is not shown is that
the impregnation in the rotational evaporator gives
the least deviation between metal proﬁles taken at
different axial and radial positions, whereas MOCVD
sometimes leads to large deviations.
Another major difference between the two impreg-
nation methods and MOCVD is connected to the
temperature treatment. For Pd-Sn on -alumina and
zirconia it was found that the palladium to tin ratio
on the surface detected by XPS is signiﬁcantly higher
when prepared by MOCVD. In all methods palladium
was deposited after tin. The average quotient of the
Pd/Sn ratio on the surface divided by the Pd/Sn ratio
in the bulk (from the weight increase after the prepa-
ration) of more than 10 membranes from each method
was 1.1 for MOCVD as opposed to 0.3 for both im-
pregnation methods. This means that only in MOCVD
the Pd/Sn ratio on the active surface is more or less
equal to the bulk value determined by the deposited
amount of metals. Membranes prepared by impregna-
tion have a lower palladium concentration on the sur-
face of the bimetallic clusters. Because tin has a much
lower melting point than palladium, it is assumed
that the high temperature during the calcination and
reduction is responsible for an enrichment of tin on
the surface. It is also possible that an alloy (PdSn3) is
formed.

3.4.1.3. Metal deposition sequence and palladium
loading.
The sequence of deposition of palladium
and tin is important in particular for the preparation
by MOCVD where no subsequent high temperature
treatment is applied. The calcination at 500◦C and
the reduction at 350◦C after the impregnation prob-
ably facilitates the diffusion of tin to the surface,
irrespective of whether palladium is on top of tin or
vice versa. In contrast, in MOCVD the deposition
of palladium after tin (A) should lead to tin clusters
partly covered by palladium whereas the opposite
sequence (B) should result in palladium clusters cov-
ered by tin. If it is true that a good catalyst must have
monometallic palladium and bimetallic Pd-Sn clusters
side by side, then membrane catalysts prepared after
sequence (A) should be more selective than those
prepared after (B). The characterisation of the surface
composition by XPS has conﬁrmed higher palladium
surface concentrations for membranes prepared with
the sequence (A) than with sequence (B), and the
catalytic experiments have shown that the selectivity
of these membranes is higher on the average. There-
fore, sequence (A) was applied for all subsequent
preparations by MOCVD.
Fig. 33 shows the results obtained under stan-
dard test conditions for a variation of the palladium
loading from 4 to 16 wt.% (based on the top layer).
Pd-Sn/-alumina membranes are shown with a pore
diameter of 100 nm and a top-layer thickness of
20 m. The Pd/Sn ratio ranged from 3 to 6. A large

scattering of the data is obvious which might be due
in part to the variation of the Pd/Sn ratio. Despite
the scattering it is noticed that the speciﬁc activity
does not change much while the selectivity to nitro-
gen is reduced at higher palladium loading. Ammo-
nium formation is the main reason but the selectivity
to nitrite is increased likewise at high palladium
loading.
The variation of the Pd/Sn ratio is addressed in
Fig. 34. Again results for -alumina-based Pd-Sn
membranes with 20 m thickness and 100 nm pore
size of the top layer are shown. The interpretation
suffers from a simultaneous change of the palladium
loading which varies from 4 to 12 wt.%. However, a
tendency can be seen, i.e. that at Pd/Sn ≈4 or larger
the lowest ammonium formation and the lowest nitrite
level is found while the activity is only slightly re-
duced compared to the activity at lower Pd/Sn ratios.
In conclusion from the results of the membrane
screening it can be said that among the two top-layer
materials zirconia is favoured. The top-layer thickness
should not exceed 20 m. Suitable pore diameters are
in the range of 60–100 nm. The palladium loading
should preferably not exceed 5 wt.% in order to max-
imise the selectivity, and a Pd/Sn ratio around 4–5 is
desirable. The simple impregnation method leads to
relatively large metal clusters (low dispersion) which
are connected to a poor activity. MOCVD in principle
has advantages over the impregnation methods. It en-
ables a better control of the deposition beneath the top

layer compared to the impregnation in the rotational
evaporator and it does not lead to an enrichment of tin
on the catalytic surface because no temperature treat-
ment is applied. However, given the fact that the uni-
formity and the reproducibility of the impregnation in
the rotational evaporator was the best of all three tech-
niques, this method was selected for the preparation
of a larger number of optimised membranes for fur-
ther kinetic studies on the inﬂuence of the important
process variables. The properties of these membranes
are given in Table 5. They are relatively close to the
desired features. Under standard test conditions (cf.
Table 4) these membranes reached an average speciﬁc
activity of 1.7 mg nitrate converted per mg palladium
and hour at a selectivity to nitrogen of 91–92%.

weeks with intermittent shutdowns overnight and at
the weekends. While shutting down the experiment it
was tried to avoid a direct contact of the membrane
with air over a longer time by storing it in distilled
water. Replicate measurements under standard con-
ditions proved that the membrane lost a part of its
activity (about 22% in 3 weeks), whereas the selec-
tivity to nitrogen remained constant within the usual
ﬂuctuations (88–92%).
3.4.2.1. Carbon dioxide ﬂow through the membrane
(pH value).
The strong inﬂuence of the pH value on
the reaction has been mentioned already as well as the
effect of the dosage of carbon dioxide. In Fig. 35 the
inﬂuence of the carbon dioxide volumetric ﬂow rate
through the membrane on the speciﬁc activity and the
selectivity is shown. At zero ﬂow rate, i.e. no buffering
in the catalytic layer, the selectivity to nitrogen is only
45% at an activity of 0.75 mg NO3−/mg Pd h. The pH
value of the reactor liquid is 6.2. Under these condi-
tions nitrite is formed with a relatively high selectivity
of 40%. The remaining 15% fall to ammonium. Al-
ready at a low carbon dioxide ﬂow rate of 5 ml/min
the selectivity to nitrogen rises signiﬁcantly and the
formation of nitrite is more than halved. The pH value
in the reactor is reduced to 5.4 and the speciﬁc ac-
tivity is doubled. When, the carbon dioxide ﬂow rate
is further increased the increase of the activity begins
to level off and ﬁnally, at very high carbon dioxide
ﬂows, the activity is decreased again. The selectivity to

nitrogen behaves differently: it is increased steadily
until it approaches a value of about 95% at very high
carbon dioxide ﬂow rates. The highest activity is found
at a carbon dioxide ﬂow rate of 35 ml/min. Under these
conditions the pH value in the reactor is around 4.7.
The selectivity to nitrogen is 89%, nitrite is hardly
found, and the remaining 10–11% fall to ammonium.
The decrease of the activity at very high carbon diox-
ide ﬂow rates can be explained by a reduction of the
hydrogen partial pressure inside the membrane. This
occurs when the carbon dioxide ﬂow rate exceeds the
rate at which it is dissolved in the liquid and the carbon

dioxide partial pressure is increased at the expense of
hydrogen. With signiﬁcantly reduced hydrogen partial
pressure in the gas the reaction rate becomes limited
by hydrogen mass transfer.
3.4.2.2. Hydrogen pressure in the membrane.
A
convenient method to increase the reaction rate is
to rise the hydrogen pressure in the membrane. In
principle the pressure can be increased up to the bub-
ble point pressure, although the beneﬁcial effect is
lost at some point when the hydrogen mass transfer
does no longer limit the reaction rate. This behaviour
180
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
is seen in Fig. 36 from the S-shaped curve giving
the speciﬁc activity. In view of the deviation of the
ammonium selectivity at low and high hydrogen pres-
sure it appears as if the formation of ammonium is
not favoured by a higher hydrogen pressure in the
investigated pressure range up to 700 kPa, but at fur-
ther increased hydrogen pressure this could happen.
The dissolved hydrogen concentration in the reactor
liquid, measured by the electrochemical sensor, was
52 mol/l for a hydrogen pressure of 200 kPa and
275 mol/l for 700 kPa. The saturation level at the
applied reactor pressure of 100 kPa is 858 mol/l.
This means that even at 700 kPa hydrogen pressure
in the membrane only 1/3 of the maximum hydro-
gen concentration in the reactor liquid is reached.
Therefore, an acceleration of the reaction rate seems
still possible by further increasing the hydrogen pres-
sure. Besides the increase of the reaction rate the
selectivity to nitrite is reduced at higher hydrogen
pressure.
3.4.2.3. Reactant concentration (nitrate, nitrite, am-
monium).
Experiments were carried out with nitrate
concentrations in the reactor ranging from 50 to
500 mg/l. The results show that the selectivity is more
or less constant in this concentration range. Only at
values near 50 mg/l a decrease of the nitrogen selec-
tivity from 90 to 80% in favour of ammonium was
noticed. The reaction rate increases with higher nitrate

concentration, though not linearly but corresponding
to a reaction order of approximately 0.7.
Fig. 37 shows the reaction rate and the selectivity
observed in additional experiments with pure nitrite.
The overall behaviour is similar as with nitrate, but
at comparable reactor concentrations the reaction rate
is about three times higher and the selectivity to ni-
trogen is higher by 10%. Runs with addition of up to
68 mg/l nitrite to the standard amount of 100 mg/l ni-
trate were also performed. These experiments showed
that in presence of nitrite the removal rate of nitrate is
reduced with increasing nitrite concentration, and that
the removal rate of nitrite is lower than in absence of
nitrate. Hence, the reaction rate is not “additive” on
the catalyst, but both ions compete for (the same) ac-
tive sites.
Finally, adding ammonium to the nitrate feed gave a
small reduction of the nitrate removal rate by roughly
5%. The formation of nitrite was increased by the same
order of magnitude.
3.4.2.4. Temperature.
The reaction temperature was
varied in the range of 10–55◦C. The results are sum-
marised in Fig. 38. The speciﬁc activity increases with
temperature but the increase becomes smaller at higher
temperatures and is almost zero above 40◦C. This
points to mass transfer limitations which could control
the reaction rate at higher temperatures. Above 20◦C
the formation of ammonium is accelerated more and

more at the expense of nitrogen, whereas the net for-
mation rate of nitrite is obviously not affected by the
temperature.
3.4.2.5. N2O formation.
The nitrogen selectivities
described so far have all been obtained based on the
assumption that no N2O was formed (cf. Eq. (24)). To
check this assumption two discontinuous experiments
were performed, one with a Pd-Sn/ZrO2 membrane
and one for comparison with a Pd-Cu/ZrO2 mem-
brane. During these experiments the reactor was set
under pressure with a 3:1 mixture of hydrogen and
carbon dioxide and then closed. No gas was ﬂown
through the membrane, which now acted as one sin-
gle tubular egg-shell catalyst. Liquid samples and gas
samples were drawn off the reactor in certain time in-
tervals and analysed with the ion chromatographs and
an additional gas chromatograph (Dani 86.10, TCD)
which was prepared for analysis of N2 and N2O. These
experiments showed that the Pd-Cu-based membrane
catalyst produced similar amounts of N2O and N2,
whereas only N2 was detected in the gas phase in case
of the Pd-Sn membrane catalyst. The error of the ni-
trogen material balance was similar in both cases, i.e.
less than 20% even after 10 h. While these results do
not prove in fact that the Pd-Sn-based membrane cat-
alyst does not produce N2O, because of the high solu-
bility of N2O in water, they nevertheless show that the
N2O formation is small compared to that of the Pd-Cu
catalyst. Similar observations have been reported by
Hähnlein [104] and Daum and Vorlop [105].
In conclusion the kinetic experiments have shown
that the control of the pH value by dosage of carbon
dioxide together with hydrogen through the membrane
is the key to a good performance of the optimised
Pd-Sn/ZrO2 membranes. The hydrogen pressure in-
side the membrane represents the second important
operating variable which determines the reaction rate.
As long as the nitrate concentration is not too low
the selectivity to nitrogen can be maintained relatively
high. However, it decreases with lower nitrate concen-
tration, which means that backmixing in an industrial
reactor should be avoided. The temperature should be
kept as low as possible, but for nitrate reduction in
ground and surface water this is probably no issue.
All in all it must be said that the activity of the cat-
alytic diffusers, when operated with carbon dioxide
buffering through the membrane, is fairly good. Spe-
ciﬁc activities between 0.7 and 3.5 mg NO3−/mg Pd h
and nitrogen selectivities of 82–92% were reached de-
pending on the operating conditions.
4. Critical evaluation and outlook
It has been shown that catalytic membranes with
interesting properties can be obtained by introduc-
ing palladium and tin in the top layer of asymmetric
182
R. Dittmeyer et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 173 (2001) 135–184
porous ceramic membranes, preferentially employing
macro/mesoporous -alumina or zirconia as top-layer
materials. These membranes can be used as catalytic
diffusers for the hydrogenation of nitrate and nitrite
in water. The main advantage of the catalytic diffuser,
besides the immobilisation of the active phase, is the
possibility to supply the required hydrogen together
with carbon dioxide used as a buffering agent directly
to the catalytic region. Thereby it is possible not only
to diminish the hydrogen mass transfer resistance but
also to control the local pH value in the catalytic layer
without the need to saturate the whole reactor liquid
with carbon dioxide. And it is possible to control the
nitrate removal rate by variation of the hydrogen pres-
sure in the membrane, which allows to adjust the re-
action rate quickly to changing requirements.
Optimised Pd-Sn/ZrO2 diffusers prepared by im-
pregnation in a rotational evaporator have shown
an average speciﬁc activity for nitrate removal of
1.7 mg NO3−/mg Pd h in standard tests (twice-distilled
water) together with a nitrogen selectivity around
90% at conversions from 15 to 50%. The speciﬁc
activity for removal of nitrite was three times higher
while the nitrogen selectivity under these conditions
reached up to 95%. Compared to other approaches
aimed at the immobilisation of ﬁne catalyst particles
for the reduction of nitrate, e.g. using cross-ﬂow poly-
mer membranes with built in catalyst particles [116],
hollow ﬁbres packed with powder catalysts [104,117],
PVAL encapsulated catalysts [108,118] and ceramic
membranes with impregnated catalytic metals in
cross-ﬂow [100,119] these are excellent results. How-
ever, the present selectivity to ammonium (6–10%) is
still not sufﬁcient for a technical process, where the
ammonium level must be kept below 0.5 mg/l.
First experiments with tap water have shown re-
cently that the catalytic diffusers can work also un-
der more realistic operating conditions. However, in
presence of large amounts of carbonates/bicarbonates
the carbon dioxide buffering through the membrane
proved to be less effective, which led to a 20% de-
crease of the nitrogen selectivity. A good performance
over 3 weeks was demonstrated on tap water with-
out carbonates/bicarbonates. It was found that the dif-
fusers are deactivated to some extent in contact with
air, and that they can be regenerated by a new re-
duction in hydrogen containing atmosphere. More-
over, the membranes are able to remove chlorinated
hydrocarbons and chlorine containing pesticides from
the water very efﬁciently along with nitrate (reductive
dechlorination). An accompanying modelling study
was started to assist the interpretation of the experi-
mental results, in particular concerning the interaction
of the mass transfer and the reaction kinetics in the
catalytic diffuser.
Finally, there seems to be still room for an improve-
ment of the preparation of the catalytic diffusers, i.e.
with respect to the metal dispersion, to the support
and additional promoters. Therefore, it is believed that
this technology could in fact lead to the development
of an improved catalytic process for nitrate removal
from water supplies.
