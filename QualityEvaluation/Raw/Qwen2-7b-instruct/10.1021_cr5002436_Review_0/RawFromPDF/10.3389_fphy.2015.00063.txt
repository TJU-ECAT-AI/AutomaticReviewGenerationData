Intermittent ﬂuid pulses in the Earth’s crust can explain a variety of geological phenomena,
for instance the occurrence of hydraulic breccia. Fluid transport in the crust is usually
modeled as continuous Darcian ﬂow, ignoring that sufﬁcient ﬂuid overpressure can cause
hydraulic fractures as ﬂuid pathways with very dynamic behavior. Resulting hydraulic
fracture networks are largely self-organized: opening and healing of hydraulic fractures
depends on local ﬂuid pressure, which is, in turn, largely controlled by the fracture
network. We develop a crustal-scale 2D computer model designed to simulate this
process. To focus on the dynamics of the process we chose a setup as simple as
possible. Control factors are constant overpressure at a basal ﬂuid source and a constant
“viscous” parameter controlling fracture-healing. Our results indicate that at large healing
rates hydraulic fractures are mobile, transporting ﬂuid in intermittent pulses to the surface
and displaying a 1/fα behavior. Low healing rates result in stable networks and constant
ﬂow. The efﬁciency of the ﬂuid transport is independent from the closure dynamics of
veins or fractures. More important than preexisting fracture networks is the distribution
of ﬂuid pressure. A key requirement for dynamic fracture networks is the presence of a
ﬂuid pressure gradient.

Introduction
Fluid ﬂow in the Earth’s crust is evidenced by a variety of geological phenomena, including
veins and hydraulic breccias. Veins are dilatant structures, typically fractures, ﬁlled with minerals
that precipitated from ﬂuid (see review of [1], and references therein). Hydraulic breccias are
fragmented rocks where the fragmentation is mainly caused by chaotic fracturing due to ﬂuid
overpressure [2–5], as opposed to tectonic breccias where the diminution is due to tectonic stresses,
typically along faults [6–8].
Both veins and breccias usually show evidence for repeated fracturing. Veins commonly
exhibit microstructures that are indicative of the “crack-seal mechanism” [9], where a
crack repeatedly opens and is subsequently sealed again by mineral growth (Figure 1).
This crack-sealing, which can be repeated thousands of times in a single vein, indicates
that ﬂuid ﬂow is not continuous, but intermittent: ﬂuid pressure builds up to exceed
the tensional strength of the rock and cause failure, after which ﬂow can occur until
the fracture permeability is sealed oﬀagain [9–13]. Hydraulic breccias also typically show
indications of repeated fracturing in the form of clasts in clasts and brecciated cement
[4, 14].
Sachau et al.
Dynamics of hydraulic fracture networks
Although evidence for intermittent ﬂuid ﬂow is abundant,
relatively little is known on the duration of and time spans
between fracturing events. An indirect indication can be achieved
by considering ﬂuid ﬂow velocities and total ﬂuxes. Theoretical
considerations of fracture propagation velocity, and hence
velocity of contained ﬂuid, range from m/yr to m/s [15, 16]. The
large range is mostly due to uncertainty in the fracture toughness
of rocks. Field observations suggest that ﬂow velocities can reach
the upper end of the range. For example, [17] and [18] estimated
ﬂow velocities of 0.01–0.1 m/s from the size of grains that were
carried up by the ﬂuid. Using similar arguments, [24] derived
ﬂow velocities in excess of 5 m/s in a ﬂuidized breccia with
m-sized clasts from the Cloncurry District, Australia.
Weisheit et al. [4] describe a hydraulic breccia, the Hidden
Valley Breccia, Australia, that is 10 km2 in outcrop and contains
clasts that range from <0.1 mm to >100 m in size. It formed over
a period of more than 150 million years, as basement gneisses
were exhumed in this area by over 12 km [19]. The estimated
amount of ﬂuid to have produced this breccia is about 20 km3.
Assuming a porosity of 10% and a ﬂow rate of 1 m/s, at the upper
end of the aforementioned range, the estimated duration of ﬂow
(1t) would only be about 2100 s, or a mere few hours. This
is a minute fraction of the >100 million years it took to form
the breccia. Even if the ﬂow rate was 1 m/yr, the total duration
would only be about 2100 years. Fluid ﬂow must therefore have
been highly intermittent with only very occasionally short bursts
of ﬂow, and extremely long periods of pressure buildup. This
mechanism can result in dense networks of veins composed of
many crack-seal events that formed over long periods of time
[e.g., 20].
Intermittent ﬂow is predicted to occur when the matrix
permeability of a rock is insuﬃcient to accommodate ﬂuid ﬂow
[21, 22]. This leads to an increase in ﬂuid pressure and opening
of hydrofractures. When exceeding a critical length, these can

become mobile by propagation on one end and closure at the
other. Such “mobile hydrofractures” thus propagate together with
their contained ﬂuid and can reach velocities in the order of
m/s [16, 22, 23]. Possible ﬂuid sources which may generate the
necessary ﬂuid pressure for hydraulic brecciation and hydraulic
fracturing are ﬂuid released by igneous intrusions [24], ﬂuid
release due to decompression [25, 26] or mineral dehydration
reactions [27]. Dehydration of the mineral biotite appears to be
the main ﬂuid source in case of Hidden Valley [4].
In contrast, classically large-scale ﬂuid ﬂow is assumed to take
place by slow, convective ﬂuid percolation, typically driven by
topography or thermal instabilities, for example due to igneous
intrusions [28, 29]. Such convective ﬂow requires a ﬂuid pressure
that is close to hydrostatic, which is incompatible with the high,
supra-lithostatic ﬂuid pressures required to fracture rocks to
produce veins and breccias [1].
A number of numerical models for hydrofracture formation
exist already [30, 31] while new models are continuously
developed [e.g., 32–36]. The current interest in these models
is mainly triggered by the enormous economic importance of
artiﬁcial hydraulic (aka “fracking”) as a means of oil and gas
extraction. However, these models are focused on the micro- to
meso-scale, where single cracks and fractures can be numerically
resolved. Existing numerical models for crustal scale ﬂow, on
the other hand, do not consider the interplay between ﬂuid
ﬂow and hydraulic fracturing, but assume that the intrinsic
matrix permeability of rocks is the only relevant parameter
[e.g., 37–39]. Miller and Nur [21] developed a crustal scale
cellular automaton model which was able to capture the general
dynamics of large scale hydraulic fracture networks, but wasn’t
based on realistic concepts for ﬂuid propagation and closing of
fractures.
To our knowledge, the numerical model developed and
applied in this study is the ﬁrst discrete crustal scale 2D
model which integrates ﬂuid ﬂow dynamics and hydrofracture
formation. This setup permits modeling of dynamic hydraulic
fracture networks and the derivation of the key control factors.
The setup is intentionally simple compared to the “real”
crust, since we are interested in the general characteristics
of the fracture patterns and the eﬃciency of the transport
mechanism.
Below we ﬁrst show that the transport mechanism of crustal
ﬂuid must include hydraulic fracturing in order to explain the
hydraulic rocks at Mount Painter. In a second step we investigate
the hydraulic fracture patterns which develop in a simpliﬁed
crust in a 2D model. We exclude the consideration of ﬁner
geological intricacies in the model, e.g., geological layering. Of
more importance in this context are the inﬂuence of a crustal
scale pressure gradient and the rate of closure of hydraulic
fractures.

where ρH2O is the density of water, Pf the ﬂuid pressure, g earth’s

the height diﬀerence between start point and end point of the
ﬂuid ﬂow. In case of vertical ﬂuid ﬂow, and with reference to the
surface, L = z and Pf ,surface = 0.
It is commonly assumed that ﬂuid overpressure causes tensile
fracturing [e.g., 33, 40, 41, 43]. Therefore, ﬂuid pressure is non-
destructive as long as one of the following relation holds, which
are commonly applied fracture conditions [compare for instance
[33, 44, 47]:
Pf < σ3 + Pcr
(2)
or
σ1 −σ3 ≥4Pcr
(3)
where σ1 and σ3 are the maximum and minimum principal
normal stress in the solid and Pcr is the tensile strength of the
material. Here, tensile stress is negative.
The state of stress in the crust is probably among the most
controversial issues in geology/geophysics. While it is generally
safe to assume hydrostatic conditions for the ﬂuid pressure, the
conditions for solid stress in the crust are a topic of continuous
debate. Elastic theory links uniaxial vertical loading stress to the
horizontal stress via a function of the Poisson ratio µ, which is
typically about 0.2–0.3 for geological materials. However, new
data [48] suggests that solid stress in the crust is approximately
isotropic if external tectonic stress is absent and below c. 1000 m
depth., i.e., σ3 ≈σ1. The reason is that the loading stress is mainly
compensated by brittle plastic deformation at this depth.
We apply this criterion in the numerical model, which
means that we eﬀectively adapt the so-called lithostatic stress
model [e.g., 49], which assumes isotropic solid stress conditions.
This choice has been partly made because one of the speciﬁc
aims of this study was to use a simpliﬁed model, and to
focus on the driving forces. The driving force for hydraulic
fracturing is mainly the ﬂuid pressure, independent of a speciﬁc
crustal stress model, due to the nature of the ﬂuid pressure
gradient.
This means that the modeled solid stress ﬁeld is probably
not exactly correct very close to the surface. However, the range
of possible horizontal stress values that has been reported is
large and includes the isotropic stress case (σv/σh = 1) till
approximately 250 m depth [48]. Since we are concerned with
the ﬂuid ﬂow at a larger depth rather than in surface vicinity,
this was considered an acceptable compromise. This compromise
deems even more acceptable as we have to assume a permanent
open fracture network close to the surface, whose non-dynamic
behavior is not within the scope of interest for this study.
Under these conditions the criterion for failure is simply:
−Peﬀ> Pcr,
(4)
where Peﬀ= σ3 −Pf is the eﬀective pressure. The overpressure
Po is deﬁned as Po = −Peﬀ, if Peﬀ< 0. Obviously, hydraulic
fracturing occurs if Po > Pcr.
FIGURE 2 | (A) Idealized pressure gradients in the Earth’s crust. Due to its
higher density, the lithostatic (solid) pressure increases with depth faster than
the hydrostatic (ﬂuid) pressure. The effective pressure (Peff = Ps −Pf) is
in-between. (B) Formation of mobile hydrofractures [after 1]. The different
pressure gradients of ﬂuid and solid lead to ﬂuid overpressure in the upper part
of a fracture and to ﬂuid underpressure at the lower part of the fracture. The
fracture moves upward. Please note that the average ﬂuid pressure in a
hydraulic fracture is identical to the pressure in the solid.
Figure 2A shows the idealized increase of ﬂuid and solid stress
with depth. Due to diﬀerent gradients of ﬂuid pressure and solid
pressure (Ps) the diﬀerence between Peﬀand Ps increases with
depth. Therefore, at large depth a required ﬂuid pressure in order
to initialize hydraulic fracturing is larger than at a shallower
depth. This has the additional eﬀect that the ﬂuid pressure
gradient in the vicinity of a ﬂuid source is often higher at large
depth than it is at shallower crustal levels, resulting in larger ﬂow
velocities on fractures at depth (Equation 1). Another eﬀect of
the diﬀerent ﬂuid and solid pressure gradients is the potential
formation of mobile hydraulic fractures (Figure 2B, [1]).
Equation (1) in combination with the criterion for hydraulic
fracturing (Equations 2–4) permits the calculation of the
necessary minimum conductivity that crustal rocks must have
in order to conduct ﬂuid ﬂow with a given ﬂow rate. A
potential ﬂuid source in the Earth’s crust are metamorphic
dehydration reactions, which are caused by changing pressure
and temperature conditions.
For simplicity we consider the mineral reaction biotite →
feldspar + Fe/Mg-oxide + water as the single ﬂuid source,
which has been suggested for the Mount Painter breccias [4].
We further assume that the reaction occurs at a depth of 16
km depth [e.g., 4, 50]. With a tensile strength of 1 MPa [44]
the ﬂuid pressure is very close to the lithostatic pressure if
hydraulic fracturing is initiated. If we assume a volumetric ﬂux of
1 m/s, which has been suggested for Mount Painter, a necessary
minimum conductivity of approximately 6 × 10−5 m/s for the
conducting material follows from Equation (1). The conductivity
of non-fractured crustal material is approximately in the range
of 10−9–10−12 ms/s [43], several orders of magnitude too small
to allow the necessary ﬂuid ﬂow from the source zone to the
surface.
It must be concluded that ﬂuid transport on the scale as
observed at Mount Painter can occur only along fractures.
These fractures may be either stationary or dynamic and mobile,

depending on the evolution of the ﬂuid stress ﬁeld and the rate
of fracture closure/healing once the ﬂuid pressure decreases. If
fractures heal slowly enough, fractures remain open between
intermittent ﬂuid pulses, and the fracture network is therefore
stationary. The most dominant contributions to the closure of
fractures are healing (plastic deformation; [49], see also Figure 4)
and sealing (e.g., due to mineral precipitation or cataclasis; [40]).
Numerical Model
The computer model consists of a 2D section of crustal
dimensions through a material with constant porosity and
conductivity of the undamaged rock matrix, which represents
a simpliﬁed Earth’s crust. Fluid ﬂow through porous rocks
and through fractures can be modeled as Darcian ﬂow, using
Equation (1). We solve the Darcy equation with a Monte Carlo
approach applied to an explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence solution on a
regular square grid, which allows the computation of ﬂuid ﬂow
in highly anisotropic and heterogeneous media. The nodes in
this grid represent fractured or undamaged material with two
diﬀerent predeﬁned hydraulic conductivities (Table 1). Fractures
can be either horizontally or vertically oriented, therefore the
fracture conductivity is anisotropic.
Fracture nucleation and fracture propagation are distinctly
diﬀerent steps in the simulations. Nucleation takes place once
ﬂuid pressure at a node is suﬃciently high to cause fracturing
in either the horizontal or vertical direction, according to the
fracture criterion outlined in Equations (2–4). In order to model
the inherent disorder of the material, Gaussian noise is applied
to the tensile strength of the nodes and to the conductivity of
fractures. The solid stress is considered to be isotropic (see cp the
discussion in Section Fluid Flow and Hydraulic Fracturing in the
Earth’s Crust), meaning that fracture nuclei increase conductivity
in both directions, horizontal and vertical.
In the numerical model a layer of constant overpressure
at the lower model boundary serves as the ﬂuid source. This
allows us an assessment of the eﬃciency of the ﬂuid transport
in the system as the eﬀective conductivity of the system
once the system reaches a state of dynamic equilibrium. We
coined the term “eﬀective conductivity” for this study, which
describes the averaged conductivity from the source at the lower
boundary to the sink at the surface. Other ﬂuid sources, for
instance a constant production of ﬂuid mass instead of constant
pressure, wouldn’t allow a similarly simple description of the
system.
The overpressure at the lower system boundary is freely
selectable in each simulation. The rate of ﬂuid production is
therefore a direct function of the eﬃciency of the ﬂuid transport

from the source to the surface. Geologically, this might represent
a pressure controlled ﬂuid-producing mineral reaction.
Nodes are assumed to be mechanically coupled, which is
a typical assumption for the formation and propagation of
hydraulic fractures [e.g., 40, 51]. Thus, fractures propagate if the
ﬂuid stress at an already fractured node is suﬃciently high to
fulﬁll the fracture condition at a neighboring node too:

where the superscript n refers to the neighbor node (Figure 3).
Time stepping is often a non-trivial issue in the modeling
of geological processes, where long-term processes cause and
interact with dynamic processes on far shorter time scales.
The computer simulations use adaptive time steps with a ﬁxed
maximum 1tmax. Time steps 1t are determined by an estimate
of the minimum time it takes to build up suﬃcient pressure at the
existing fracture tips to cause further fracture propagation. If this
time estimate is larger than 1tmax, 1t is set to 1tmax.
Closing and healing of fractures is a complex process, which
involves elastic and viscous closure of the fracture and dissolution
and precipitation of minerals within the fracture former fracture
aperture. Here we assume that a fracture is closed by viscous
ﬂow of the solid matrix into irregularities of the fault surface
once Peﬀ> 0 only, an assumption which is suitable for the

fractured clasts rather than by clear cut fracture walls. These clasts act as
barriers against a simple elastic closure of the fracture once ﬂuid pressure

up by the clasts.
given fundamental assumption of damage zones or tectonic
breccias rather than discrete faults with clear cut parallel walls
(cp Figure 4). Because the impact of the fracture closure rate on
the dynamics of the fracture network is one of the major interests
in this study, the solid viscosity is considered homogeneous
throughout the entire system. The fracture aperture is a function
of the former ﬂuid overpressure in the fracture and is calculated
by a solution adapted from Maugis [51].
Setup of Numerical Simulations and
Results
General Setup
Material parameters are compiled in Table 1. The following
parameters are identical in all conducted simulations: the system
size is 8000 (horizontal) by 16,000 m (vertical), with a distance
1l between ﬂuid source and ﬂuid sink of 15,750 m. A resolution
of 100 × 200 grid points is commonly used, but has been
occasionally compared to results with a solution of 150 × 300 in
order to test the resolution dependency of the model. Gaussian
normal distribution on the tensile strength of nodes assumes a
mean strength of 1 MPa and a standard deviation of 0.1 MPa. The
basal source layer with constant ﬂuid overpressure Po = const
and the ﬂuid sink with Pf = 0 Pa are located at opposed system
boundaries.
Modeling of individual fractures and fracture planes in a
crustal scale model requires a resolution which is not achievable
with today’s computational equipment. The model therefore
assumes that fractures form as fracture networks and aﬀect the
entire area deﬁned by a gridpoint. Comparing the results from
simulations with diﬀerent resolutions did not show a change
of the system behavior regarding fracture mobility and ﬂuid
transport eﬃciency.
In order to test the inﬂuence on the dynamics of the fracture
network, Po of the ﬂuid source is varied between 0.5 and
2.0 MPa during the simulations and the solid viscosity ν between
1017 and 1023 Pa s, which can be assumed to be close to
the geologically realistic lower and upper limit [52, 53]. We
assume here that fractured nodes have the same conductivity as a
typical sedimentary breccia [54–56], since fracturing in the crust
typically results in the formation of a damage zone rather than an
isolated fracture plane [34, 57].
The choice of a crustal stress model is a rather diﬃcult one
since the topic is still under intense debate. The model assumes
a isotropic lithostatic solid stress, which is probably a good
approximation in case of a vertical crustal section, given that the
depth is considerably larger than ∼1 km and external tectonic
forces are absent (compare discussion in Section Fluid Flow
and Hydraulic Fracturing in the Earth’s Crust). This assumption
ignores natural variations in the horizontal stress ﬁeld, which are
frequently observed drill-holes, but are diﬃcult to quantify in a
model [58, 59].
Experiments in a System without Pressure
Gradient (“Horizontal” Proﬁle)
In order to test the inﬂuence of the pressure gradient on the
dynamics of fracture formation and propagation, we compare
the time evolution of hydraulic fractures through a vertical 2D
section through the crust (1z = 16.000 m) with a horizontal
section (1z = 0 m). Fluid stress is constant in the case of a
horizontal section, i.e., dPf /dL = 0.
Figure 5 displays the resulting hydraulic fracture pattern, the
ﬂuid mass change with time (1mf /t) and the fractured area in the
horizontal system. The ﬂuid source is located at the left system
boundary with a constant overpressure Po = 1.2 MPa while the
sink is at the right of the system. Thus, the hydraulic head over
the entire system length is 1H = 1P = 1.2 MPa, identical to
simulations set in a vertical proﬁle.
The ﬁnal fracture network that develops in these experiments
is stationary. Close to the source a fracture front develops, which
is replaced by individual fractures once the front reaches a certain
distance from the sink (Figure 5). Fractures do not close once
formed but maintain suﬃcient ﬂuid overpressure to keep existing
fractures open.
If fractures penetrate the sink, a large amount of ﬂuid is
quickly drained into a ﬂuid burst, creating the large negative
peaks in Figure 5B. Once a suﬃcient number of fractures reach
the sink, an equilibrium between ﬂuid production and ﬂuid
drainage is reached and the ﬂuid mass remains approximately
constant (Figure 5, constant conditions are reached from 3000
years onward). From this point on the fracture pattern is
stationary. Due to the constant ﬂuid overpressure in fractures, the
fracture viscosity is irrelevant to the development of the fracture
network and the fault patterns are identical whether ν = 1017
or 1023 Pa s. Negative spikes in the ﬂuid mass change between

(1mf/t) (B) and total fractured area in % (C) in an simulation where the
hydraulic fracture propagation is calculated for a horizontal 2D section
through the crust, i.e., in the absence of an initial pressure gradient.
The situation is somewhat similar to ﬂow to a well. Low viscosity conditions
(ν = 1017 Pa s), i.e., fractures close quickly. (A) Fractured nodes are white.
Fluid source is a constant layer with constant ﬂuid pressure Pf = 1.2 MPa at
the left boundary of the model, the sink is at the right boundary with constant
Pf = 0 Pa, similar to experiments with vertical fracture propagation. Fractures
propagate until the source is sufﬁciently connected to the sink, at which point
ﬂow becomes stable. The fracture network is stationary, even though the
viscosity is low. The ﬂuid mass in the system remains constant from this point
on (B). Negative peaks are created by rapid drainage of the system ﬂuid mass
when a fracture reaches the other side and ﬂuid pressure is rapidly released.
From 3000 a onwards no further fracturing occurs. (C) Propagation of the
fracture front is fast at the beginning, then slows down and converges against
zero, which is indicated by a constant percentage of fractured material in the
system.
1500 and 2700 years (Figure 5B) correlate with the permanent
opening of single fractures, which cause sudden and very eﬃcient
drainage resulting in a short dewatering event. Once the fracture
network is eﬃcient enough to provide continuous pathways from
the source to the sink, both the fracture distribution and the ﬂuid
mass in the system remain constant.
Unlike the vertical experiments described below, we were
unable to establish a permanent pulsating regime in these
experiments. If the ﬂuid pressure at the source is to small,
ﬂow occurs within the rock matrix. If pressure is high, a stable
fracture pattern develops, where the total number of fractures
increases with the pressure at the source. Dynamic ﬂow and
fracture formation, however, seem to rely on the presence of a
ﬂuid pressure gradient, as in the numerical simulations discussed
below.
Experiments with Fluid Pressure Gradient
(Vertical Proﬁle)
If basal ﬂuid overpressure is suﬃciently large (starting already at
Po ≈0.8 MPa, due to the noise on the tensile strength), hydraulic
fractures form and drain the ﬂuid produced at the basal ﬂuid
source toward the surface. In all experiments the fractured area
increases until the fracture network is eﬃcient enough to create
equilibrium between ﬂuid production at the basal ﬂuid source
and ﬂuid drainage at the surface.
Two sets of simulations have been computed: one set with ν =
1017 and 1023 Pa s (Figures 6–10). A detailed description follows
in the sections below. The ﬂuid overpressure of the ﬂuid source
was varied between 0.5 and 2.0 MPa. The characteristic values
in Figures 6, 9—the fractured area and the balance between
ﬂuid production and ﬂuid drainage 1mf /t—reach near-stable
plateaus with recurring patterns, indicating that the system
is in a dynamic or stable equilibrium (discussed in Section
Intermittency of Fluid Flow).
Low Viscosity Simulations (Quick Fracture Healing)
Results for a viscosity mode (ν = 1017 Pa s) are displayed in
Figure 6. At 0.85 MPa basal overpressure stationary hydraulic
fractures form at locations with low tensile strength and
propagate upwards from there. Although these fractures are
spatially stationary, they are in a dynamic equilibrium as their
tips open and close periodically.
Increasing the basal overpressure to 0.9 MPa leads to the
formation of vertical mobile fracture clusters, which transport
ﬂuid pulses to the surface. The horizontal location of these
vertical pathways is stationary and depends on the distribution
of the tensile strength at the boundary layers between ﬂuid
source and non-ﬂuid producing rock matrix. With increasing
overpressure the horizontal width and the vertical extend of
the fractured areas increase, and accordingly the total amount
of fractured rock material. At a basal overpressure of approx.
1.8 MPa the system is completely fractured and fracture are
stationary.
At the beginning of each low viscosity simulation ﬂuid is
transported by small mobile hydraulic fractures along distinct
vertical pathways. These pathways are deﬁned by the tensile
strength at the interface between ﬂuid source and rock matrix.
These mobile fractures precede the fracture front and lead to
permanent elevated ﬂuid pressure along these vertical lines
(Figure 7, right). Fractures propagate from both the surface,
where eﬀective stress is close to zero, and from the sink. With the
onset of fracture formation at the surface in the more dynamic
system with ν = 1017 Pa s, ﬂuid is more eﬃciently drained and an
intermediate plateau in the development of the ﬂuid mass change
with time 1mf /t is reached.
It is not intuitively clear why fractures form far from the ﬂuid
source and close to the surface (Figure 7, left panel). The reason
is the increase of the ﬂuid pressure along the ﬂuid pathways
(Figure 7, right panel). This permanent increase, coupled with
ﬂow enabled by the background permeability of the material,
leads occasionally to fracturing even if the ﬂuid source is
in a distance. This phenomenon aﬀects primarily rocks at a
shallow depth, because the necessary increase in ﬂuid pressure
is comparatively low.
The interplay of the fracture network with the stress ﬁeld
is visible in Figure 8, where the eﬀective stress is displayed
at a random time after the system reached the state of

Fluid source is a constant layer with constant ﬂuid overpressure at the
bottom boundary of the model. The sink is at the top boundary with constant
ﬂuid pressure Pf = 0 Pa, representing a free surface. With increasing
overpressure, the total fractured area increases until the entire system is
damaged. Fracture clusters are dynamic and are mobile in the vertical
direction, moving upwards. The horizontal position is ﬁxed and determined
by the Gaussian noise. Stable fracture patterns occur at ﬁxed basal
overpressures of 0.5 and 2.0 MPa. Periodic changes of the fractured area
and of the ﬂuid mass, even after ﬂuid production and ﬂuid drainage are in
equilibrium, illustrate the dynamic nature of the fracture pattern and the ﬂuid
ﬂow. Red line: From the marked time step onward the system is considered
to be in a stable state. Power spectral density in Figure 11 is calculated for

dynamic equilibrium. If hydraulic fractures form only along
distinct vertical pathways (at a basal overpressure of 0.9 MPa),
the eﬀective stress along these pathways increases, potentially
boosting formation of future fractures along these lines. Fractures
close at locations where the eﬀective stress is high (cp. Figure 8 at
basal overpressure of 1.1 MPa).
High Viscosity Simulations (Slow Fracture Healing)
If the viscosity of the solid phase is increased to ν = 1023
Pa s fracture patterns are near-stationary, regardless of the
overpressure at the source. The stability of the fracture network
results from relatively large time interval which is necessary
to close these fractures in between ﬂuid pulses (Figure 9). The
eﬀective stress ﬁeld (Figure 10) is a function of the fracture
pattern.
An intermediate plateau of 1mf /t (approximately about
0.005–0.01 kg/s) is reached shortly before the ﬂuid network is
completed. This is similar to low viscosity simulations, but has
a diﬀerent reason: the plateau is reached once a ﬁrst front of
distinct hydraulic fractures reaches the surface. The interstitial

spaces between these fractures function as propagation path for
a secondary fracture front. Once this secondary fracture front
reaches the surface, ﬂuid production and ﬂuid drainage reach a
balanced state and 1mf /t →0.
Intermittency of Fluid Flow
If a signal is random can be distinguished by the power spectral
distribution (“psd”). Figure 11 displays the psd calculated for the
normalized fractured area of various simulations. The signal is
typical of the forma f−α, with α in the range 1.27–1.95, a clear sign
that the signal is not random white noise, but shows a correlation
in time.
FIGURE 7 | Fracture pattern and effective stress at an intermediate
state of the development of the fracture network with ν = 1017 Pa s.
Vertical experiment with ﬁxed basal overpressure of 0.9 MPa (cp. Figure 6). An
initial front of mobile fractures develops early on in the development,
generating columns of increased ﬂuid pressure. This leads to the formation of
vertical hydraulic fractures nucleating at and propagation downward from the
surface, where the difference between hydrostatic ﬂuid pressure and lithostatic
pressure is small (cp. Figure 2).
In two cases the psd in the upper frequency band is non-
linear. This aﬀects simulations with a basal overpressures of
1.1/0.85 MPa and a viscosity ν
= 1017. This result is most
probably related to issues with relatively small spatial resolution
or time intervals of the simulations. In these cases the α has been
calculated for the linear part only. A value of α = 4.0 results
for the linear region in the lower frequency band in case of the
simulation with overpressure 1.1 MPa/ν = 1017, but this value
can be attributed to the error.
Numerical simulations with near-stationary fracture networks
develop α = 0, indicating constant values with some numerical
random noise. This is the case in simulations where basal
overpressure is relatively large (compare Figures 6, 9). Psd plots
whith α = 0 were omitted from Figure 11.
The evolution of the fracture pattern for a particular
simulation (with 0.9 MPa overpressure/ν = 1017) is shown in
Figure 12. Figure 12A shows the vertical movement of fracture
clusters in system snapshots from three consecutive years. When
a cluster arrives at the surface ﬂuid drainage occurs. The
alternation with of fracture clusters with healed material causes
the intermittency of the ﬂuid ﬂow. Figure 12B displays the
time evolution of the fracture state of a horizontal section at
4000 m depth through a simulation. After c. 400 years the onset
of a fracture pattern can be seen. From then on intermittent
fracturing and healing occurs in almost regular intervals.
Transport Efﬁciency of Fracture Networks

be characterized by the hydraulic conductivity over the total

an overpressure of approx. 1 MPa (Figure 13), which is also the
mean tensile strength of the material.
This means that the mean eﬃciency of the ﬂuid transport
is independent of the fracture dynamics and the mobility of
fractures. Even before equilibrium is reached, the eﬃciency of the
diﬀerent types of fracture networks in terms of ﬂuid extraction
from source to sink is similar (cp. the ﬂuid mass change per time
in Figures 6, 9). The main diﬀerence between static and dynamic
fracture networks is the occurrence of ﬂuid pulses in case of a
dynamic fracture network, in diﬀerence to near-continuous ﬂow
in case of a stationary network.
Discussion
Dynamics of the Fracture Pattern
The development of dynamic fracture patterns in the computer
simulations—in
diﬀerence
to
a
stable
stationary
fracture
network—depends on the following three preconditions:
• The ﬂuid overpressure is close to the mean tensile strength of
the material, otherwise either no fractures form or the entire
system fractures homogeneously,
• A ﬂuid pressure gradient is present, as is the case in vertical
proﬁles through the Earth’s crust, and
• Fractures close quickly (i.e., the matrix viscosity is low), once
the ﬂuid pressure dropped below the solid pressure of the rock
matrix.
The interface layer between the ﬂuid source and the rock matrix
is particularly important for the dynamics of the process. It
works similar to a valve: once suﬃcient ﬂuid migrated from the
source into the adjacent rock mass, vertical hydraulic fractures
nucleate and propagate toward the surface, thus transporting
large amounts of ﬂuid in a short period of time. Once the
interface layer is suﬃciently drained and the ﬂuid pressure is
lower than the matrix solid pressure, fractures close and the
process starts again. This process leads to a non-random 1/f α type
signal once the system reaches a state of dynamic equilibrium,
with 1 < α < 2.

Section line is marked by the red rectangle, located at 4000 m depth. Onset of
the fracture/healing process after c. 300. The ﬁgure illustrates the intermittency
of the fracture opening/healing process, which is induced by intermittent ﬂuid
ﬂow.
Preferred vertical ﬂuid pathways develop according to
the Gauss distribution at the interface. If a fracture closes,
the ﬂuid it transported is trapped and increases the local
ﬂuid pressure due to the very low matrix conductivity. The
amount of additional ﬂuid which is required to reactivate
these nodes as fractures again is signiﬁcantly smaller than
in the adjacent material. These areas of heightened ﬂuid
pressure from potential future pathways for hydraulic fractures
and quick ﬂuid transport. Coupled with the non-destructive
background diﬀusion of the ﬂuid this can even lead to
fracture initiation in a distance to the ﬂuid source (Figure 6,
left).
If the viscosity of the surrounding solid matrix is at 1023 Pa
s fracture closure is typically slower than pressure build up and
hydraulic fracture patterns are stationary. Fluid mass balance
is reached once the fracture network is capable of draining the
entire ﬂuid mass produced at the basal source. At this point the
fractured area and the drained ﬂuid mass converge to constant
values, regardless of speciﬁc parameters. Periodic deviations from

the equilibrium occur if ν is small, and are most signiﬁcant at a
slight overpressure of approx. 1.1–1.3 MPa.
Of particular interest to the dynamics of intermittent ﬂuid
ﬂow are the amplitude and the frequency of ﬂuid pulses.
Pulses occur in simulations with a more dynamic low viscosity
setting, visible in the rate of change of the ﬂuid mass in the
system (Figures 5, 8). The amplitude of ﬂuid burst grows from
low overpressure values till the overpressure is identical with
the mean tensile stress is reached. A further increase of the
ﬂuid overpressure leads to the elimination of ﬂuid bursts with
small amplitudes, but still allows large ﬂuid pulses in regular
intervals.
Comparing the horizontal setup (without a ﬂuid pressure
gradient) to the results derived from vertical setups, it
becomes clear that the ﬂuid pressure gradient is essential
for the development of dynamic fracture networks and ﬂuid
pulses.
The presented numerical method and simulations illustrate
how a dynamic ﬂuid ﬂow system works, and the conditions under
which they can eﬃciently transport large volumes of ﬂuid to
upper levels in the crust. These models are critical to understand
highly complex transport systems, such as the ones responsible
for the formation of large hydraulic breccias or dense networks
of crack-seal veins.
The dynamics observed in the simulations—in particular the
periodic changes of the ﬂuid mass in the system, which was
observed in most setups—might help to explain phenomena
as the initially discussed hydraulic breccia, which depends on
intermittent large scale ﬂuid pulses.
It is of great interest to note that the eﬃciency of the ﬂuid
transport is virtually independent of the closing rate of the
fractures. This means that velocity and dynamics of the ﬂuid
transport do not depend on the existence and reactivation of
preexisting fracture networks, at least under model conditions.
Potential ﬂuid pathways are characterized by heightened local
ﬂuid pressure, which is a byproduct of previous ﬂuid ﬂow
transport on fractures.

Dynamics of hydraulic fracture networks
Summary and Conclusion
Fluid transport in the crust involves the formation of hydraulic
fractures if the ﬂuid overpressure at the source is suﬃcient.
Geological evidence for this process exists, for instance in form
of crack-seal veins or hydraulic breccias.
We simulated the dynamics of the vertical ﬂuid ﬂow from a
ﬂuid source with a constant overpressure to the surface, including
the evolution of hydraulic fracture patterns. The ability to close
fractures, once ﬂuid pressure is lower than the solid pressure,
is controlled by the matrix viscosity, which is taken to be at
its uppermost and lowermost geologically realistic limits. The
solid stress ﬁeld is probably approximately accurate below 250 m
depth, please note the discussion in Sections Fluid Flow and
Hydraulic Fracturing in the Earth’s Crust and General Setup.
Hydraulic fracture patterns may be either dynamic or stable,
depending on the ability of fractures to close quickly, once the
ﬂuid pressure is released. In the dynamic case hydraulic fractures
form mobile clusters and ﬂuid transport occurs in periodic
pulses. The reason is a valve function of the interface between
ﬂuid source and matrix rocks, where ﬂuid pressure builds up by
Darcian ﬂow until it is suﬃcient to initiate fracture formation
and quick removal of ﬂuid mass toward the surface. The fracture
dynamics follows a 1/f α pattern, with 1 < α < 2. If fractures
heal slowly, the fracture network is stable and ﬂuid ﬂow is nearly
constant.
The eﬃciency of the ﬂuid transport is identical in both
cases, regardless of the dynamics of the fracture network.
While the dynamics of ﬂuid ﬂow and fracture formation diﬀers
considerably between the two settings, the eﬃciency of the ﬂuid
transport is not aﬀected. Both systems have the same eﬀective
hydraulic conductivity. This is even more remarkable since the
overpressure at the ﬂuid source is constant, which means that
the ﬂuid production is entirely controlled by the eﬃciency of the
transport mechanism. This means, in turn, that the existence of a
stable fracture network is not as important as often assumed, as
long as ﬂuid overpressure is suﬃcient to initiate fracturing. More
important than a fracture network are areas of heightened ﬂuid
pressure, where a relatively small amount of additional ﬂuid is
suﬃcient to initiate further fracturing. These areas are generally
created by previous generations of hydraulic fracture swarms.
A key parameter for the dynamic fracture evolution is the
presence of a ﬂuid pressure gradient. In absence of a gradient
fracture, as is the case of the “horizontal” setup, stable networks
are being formed.
