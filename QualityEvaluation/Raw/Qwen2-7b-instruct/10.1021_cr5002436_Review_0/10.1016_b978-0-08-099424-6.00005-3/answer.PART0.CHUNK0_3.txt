[1] "Bitumen is recovered from Canadian oilsands in two ways. Deposits that are close to the surface employ surface mining to recover the oilsands, which are then extracted to recover the bitumen. Deposits that are deeper employ in situ extraction to recover the bitumen."
[2] "The two largest oilsands deposits in the world are located in Venezuela and in Canada [46]."
[3] "Most of the Canadian oilsands are in the province of Alberta and are concentrated in three regions: Athabasca-Wabiskaw, Cold Lake and Peace River."
[4] "Once the bitumen is produced, it can be upgraded and ultimately refined to final products that are of use to society, such as transport fuels [7,8]."
[5] "Native bitumen also has use in road construction and as building materials [9], although these are minor applications for oilsands derived bitumen, which is mainly used in energy production."
[6] "The subsequent discussion will focus on Canadian oilsands and oilsands-derived bitumen, because it highlights the challenges that are related to bitumen composition and lack of bitumen fluidity."
[7] "The bitumen in Canadian oilsands deposits is not in direct contact with the mineral matter, but for the most part the bitumen is separated from the mineral matter by a thin surface coating of water (Figure 5.1) [1,2]."
[8] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for all of the oilsands deposits around the world. In oil shale (Chapter 6) the organic material is in direct contact with the mineral matter."
[9] "Producing bitumen from oilsands is consequently less energy intensive than producing shale oil from oil shale."
[10] "Bitumen extraction from the oilsands ore is performed using the Clark hot water extraction process."
[11] "The overall recovery of bitumen from the oilsands ore is better than 90 %."
[12] "The density of bitumen is close to that of water. In order to facilitate gravity phase separation, the extracted slurry must be aerated to separate the bitumen as a froth phase from the water and mineral matter."
[13] "Steam displacement is not primarily used just because the bitumen is immobile at reservoir temperatures. Later on the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD, pronounced sag-dee) method was developed and it is currently the dominant in situ production technique."
[14] "The estimated production life of a SAGD well pair is around 15 years, with an ultimate bitumen recovery of (7080) % for continuous steam feed production and (2030) % for CSS."
[15] "Presently, most of the oilsands-derived bitumen that is produced is sold as either dilbit, or SCO."
[16] "The properties of oilsands-derived bitumen vary depending on the location and the quality of the ore body. For an extensive discussion on the properties and chemistry of bitumen, the reader is referred to the book by Strausz and Lown [4]."
[17] "Bitumen, like conventional crude oil, is useful only once it has been refined to transport fuels (or petrochemicals)."
[18] "It is important to point out that the CO2 footprint of any energy conversion process is related to the amount of work that has to be performed, as well as the effective H:C ratio of the raw material used in the process."
[19] "New ways will have to be found to reduce the energy use of oilsands operations, bearing in mind that there is a thermodynamic limit to the best thermal efficiency that can be attained."
[20] "Water is being used as the vehicle to deliver energy to the reservoir. New technologies that generate this energy from within the reservoir, such as in situ combustion, or that use solvents in combination or instead of steam, hold promise to reduce water consumption from oilsands operations."
[21] "The residue upgrading processes and technologies that are employed for the conversion of oilsands-derived bitumen (Section 5.5) are mature technologies. Thermal conversion processes have been in refinery operation for more than a century and residue hydroconversion is only slightly younger."
[22] "Still, it is necessary to find ways to improve technology for bitumen upgrading. Some of the key technical challenges for future improvements to bitumen upgrading are highlighted."
[23] "a. Increase liquid yield. Differently put, there is a need to moderate the extent of hydrogen disproportionation in order to suppress coke and light gas formation."
[24] "b. Reduce H2 consumption. The stoichiometric reality is that bitumen with a H:C ratio of  1.5 is hydrogen deficient compared to conventional crude oil."
[25] "c. Conversion of asphaltenes to liquids. The asphaltene fraction in bitumen is the most challenging fraction to upgrade due to its physically associative nature, high heteroatom and metals content and low H:C ratio."
