[1] "Bitumen, like conventional crude oil, is useful only once it has been refined to transport fuels (or petrochemicals)."
[2] "Unlike conventional crude oil, oilsands-derived bitumen cannot be easily transported in its native recovered state, except in heated pipelines or railcars over limited distances."
[3] "The bitumen on its own is too viscous to be transported by pipeline and it has to be diluted to increase fluidity."
[4] "Presently, most of the oilsands-derived bitumen that is produced is sold as either dilbit, or SCO."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They are extensively used in the production of plastics, rubbers, solvents, and numerous other chemical products. The market trend for light olefins is largely driven by their applications in the petrochemical sector. The key production methods involve steam cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons at high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges include optimizing the cracking conditions to maximize the yield of desired olefin products while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. The temperature and pressure settings significantly affect the yield and purity of the olefins produced. Longer alkane chains can hinder the cracking process, leading to lower olefin yields. The industry continues to develop new catalysts and process technologies to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of light olefin synthesis.
