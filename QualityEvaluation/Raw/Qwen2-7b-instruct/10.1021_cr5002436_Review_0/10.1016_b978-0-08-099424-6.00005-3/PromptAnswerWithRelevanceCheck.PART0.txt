[3] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for all of the oilsands deposits around the world."
[4] "Bitumen is recovered from Canadian oilsands in two ways. Deposits that are close to the surface employ surface mining to recover the oilsands, which are then extracted to recover the bitumen. Deposits that are deeper employ in situ extraction to recover the bitumen."
[5] "The quality of the oilsands ore varies and the cut-off for economic recovery is presently 6 wt% bitumen [1,4]."
[6] "In order to recover bitumen from deeper oilsands deposits, the bitumen must be recovered without removing the mineral matter."

[8] "Cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) was developed first as a method for the in situ production of bitumen from deeper oilsands deposits."
[9] "Steam displacement is not primarily used just because the bitumen is immobile at reservoir temperatures."
[10] "For SAGD production two horizontal wells are drilled in the oilsands ore layer, one about 5 m above the other (Figure 5.3)."
[11] "After separation of the bitumen from the water, the water is cleaned and part of the water is recycled."

[13] "Bitumen, like conventional crude oil, is useful only once it has been refined to transport fuels (or petrochemicals)."
[14] "The main disadvantage of this approach [transporting bitumen by pipeline] are that it reduces pipeline capacity by (2535) % and it requires a return pipeline for the diluent in order to produce the dilbit."
[15] "The properties of oilsands-derived bitumen vary depending on the location and the quality of the ore body."
[16] "The high viscosity of bitumen, possibly more than any other property, sets bitumen production and bitumen transport apart from that of conventional crude oil."
[17] "The main upgrading challenges are as follows: decrease the boiling point distribution, decrease the heteroatom content, increase the H:C ratio, and increase fluidity."
[18] "Visbreaking, or mild thermal cracking, is a residue upgrading technology that was developed to reduce the viscosity of fuel oil."
[19] "Coking is the prototypical carbon-rejection process. It is well suited for the upgrading heavy oils and residua with a high CCR value, as is the case with bitumen (Table 5.2)."
[20] "Residue hydroconversion involves hydrogen-addition and it is the most commonly applied conversion technology to reduce the heteroatom content of petroleum feedstocks and to increase the H:C ratio of the products."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They are extensively used in the production of plastics, rubbers, solvents, and numerous other chemical products. The market trend for light olefins is largely driven by their applications in the petrochemical sector. The key production methods involve steam cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons at high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges include optimizing the cracking conditions to maximize the yield of desired olefin products while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. The temperature and pressure settings significantly affect the yield and purity of the olefins produced. Longer alkane chains can hinder the cracking process, leading to lower olefin yields. The industry continues to develop new catalysts and process technologies to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of light olefin synthesis.

[6] "The subsequent discussion will focus on Canadian oilsands and oilsands-derived bitumen, because it highlights the challenges that are related to bitumen composition and lack of bitumen fluidity."
[7] "The bitumen in Canadian oilsands deposits is not in direct contact with the mineral matter, but for the most part the bitumen is separated from the mineral matter by a thin surface coating of water (Figure 5.1) [1,2]."
[8] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for all of the oilsands deposits around the world. In oil shale (Chapter 6) the organic material is in direct contact with the mineral matter."

[11] "The overall recovery of bitumen from the oilsands ore is better than 90 %."
[12] "The density of bitumen is close to that of water. In order to facilitate gravity phase separation, the extracted slurry must be aerated to separate the bitumen as a froth phase from the water and mineral matter."
[13] "Steam displacement is not primarily used just because the bitumen is immobile at reservoir temperatures. Later on the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD, pronounced sag-dee) method was developed and it is currently the dominant in situ production technique."

[19] "New ways will have to be found to reduce the energy use of oilsands operations, bearing in mind that there is a thermodynamic limit to the best thermal efficiency that can be attained."
[20] "Water is being used as the vehicle to deliver energy to the reservoir. New technologies that generate this energy from within the reservoir, such as in situ combustion, or that use solvents in combination or instead of steam, hold promise to reduce water consumption from oilsands operations."
[21] "The residue upgrading processes and technologies that are employed for the conversion of oilsands-derived bitumen (Section 5.5) are mature technologies. Thermal conversion processes have been in refinery operation for more than a century and residue hydroconversion is only slightly younger."
[22] "Still, it is necessary to find ways to improve technology for bitumen upgrading. Some of the key technical challenges for future improvements to bitumen upgrading are highlighted."
[23] "a. Increase liquid yield. Differently put, there is a need to moderate the extent of hydrogen disproportionation in order to suppress coke and light gas formation."
[24] "b. Reduce H2 consumption. The stoichiometric reality is that bitumen with a H:C ratio of  1.5 is hydrogen deficient compared to conventional crude oil."
[25] "c. Conversion of asphaltenes to liquids. The asphaltene fraction in bitumen is the most challenging fraction to upgrade due to its physically associative nature, high heteroatom and metals content and low H:C ratio."

5.2 BITUMEN PRODUCTION FROM OILSANDS
Bitumen is recovered from Canadian oilsands in two ways. Deposits that are close to the surface employ surface mining to recover the oilsands, which are then extracted to recover the bitumen. Deposits that are deeper employ in situ extraction to recover the bitumen.
Mining of oilsands can be considered to a depth of 75 m. The in situ extraction of oilsands requires depths of 200 m or more. At present there is no economical technology for the recovery of bitumen from oilsands deposits that are (75200) m below the surface.

5.2.1 Extraction of Mined Oilsands
Open pit mining is the most economical recovery method of oilsands deposits that are close to the surface. Even with deposits close to the surface, there is some overburden material that does not contain oilsands, and that must be removed prior to recovery of the oilsands ore. The cost of mining increases as the ratio of the height of the over- burden material to the height of the oilsands ore layer increases. This ratio is also called the strip ratio. Oilsands mining operations have strip ratios mostly in the range (0.41.4) [10].
A block flow diagram illustrating the extraction process to recover bitumen from mined oilsands is given in Figure 5.2.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Surface mining is the most cost-effective method for recovering oilsands deposits near the surface. Despite being close to the surface, there is overburden material that does not contain oilsands, which needs to be removed before mining. The cost of mining rises as the ratio of the overburden material's height to the oilsands ore layer's height increases, known as the strip ratio. Oilsands mining typically has strip ratios ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 [10].

在接近地表的位置进行露天采矿是回收油砂矿床最经济的方法。尽管靠近地表，但仍存在不含油砂的覆盖物需要在采矿前移除。随着覆盖物高度与油砂矿层高度比例的增加，采矿成本上升，这一比例也被称为剥离比。油砂采矿通常的剥离比在0.4到1.4之间[10]。

5.2.2 In Situ Production
When oilsands deposits are too deep, mining methods to recover the ore for extraction becomes uneconomical. In order to recover bitumen from deeper oilsands deposits, the bitumen must be recovered without removing the mineral matter. The main challenge to the in situ produc- tion of the bitumen is finding an economical way to increase the fluidity of the bitumen, which is very viscous. The viscosity of the bitumen can be decreased by increasing the temperature or by dissolving the bitumen in a light solvent. Once the bitumen is fluid enough, it can be recovered from an oil well, analogous to conventional crude oil recovery.
