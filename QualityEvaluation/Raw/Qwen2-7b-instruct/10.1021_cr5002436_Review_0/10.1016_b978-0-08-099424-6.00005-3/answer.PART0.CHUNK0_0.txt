[1] "The two largest oilsands deposits in the world are located in Venezuela and in Canada [46]."
[2] "The bitumen present in oilsands and oil shale is strongly associated with mineral matter."
[3] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for all of the oilsands deposits around the world."
[4] "Bitumen is recovered from Canadian oilsands in two ways. Deposits that are close to the surface employ surface mining to recover the oilsands, which are then extracted to recover the bitumen. Deposits that are deeper employ in situ extraction to recover the bitumen."
[5] "The quality of the oilsands ore varies and the cut-off for economic recovery is presently 6 wt% bitumen [1,4]."
[6] "In order to recover bitumen from deeper oilsands deposits, the bitumen must be recovered without removing the mineral matter."
[7] "The viscosity of the bitumen can be decreased by increasing the temperature or by dissolving the bitumen in a light solvent."
[8] "Cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) was developed first as a method for the in situ production of bitumen from deeper oilsands deposits."
[9] "Steam displacement is not primarily used just because the bitumen is immobile at reservoir temperatures."
[10] "For SAGD production two horizontal wells are drilled in the oilsands ore layer, one about 5 m above the other (Figure 5.3)."
[11] "After separation of the bitumen from the water, the water is cleaned and part of the water is recycled."
[12] "The estimated production life of a SAGD well pair is around 15 years, with an ultimate bitumen recovery of (7080) % for continuous steam feed production and (2030) % for CSS."
[13] "Bitumen, like conventional crude oil, is useful only once it has been refined to transport fuels (or petrochemicals)."
[14] "The main disadvantage of this approach [transporting bitumen by pipeline] are that it reduces pipeline capacity by (2535) % and it requires a return pipeline for the diluent in order to produce the dilbit."
[15] "The properties of oilsands-derived bitumen vary depending on the location and the quality of the ore body."
[16] "The high viscosity of bitumen, possibly more than any other property, sets bitumen production and bitumen transport apart from that of conventional crude oil."
[17] "The main upgrading challenges are as follows: decrease the boiling point distribution, decrease the heteroatom content, increase the H:C ratio, and increase fluidity."
[18] "Visbreaking, or mild thermal cracking, is a residue upgrading technology that was developed to reduce the viscosity of fuel oil."
[19] "Coking is the prototypical carbon-rejection process. It is well suited for the upgrading heavy oils and residua with a high CCR value, as is the case with bitumen (Table 5.2)."
[20] "Residue hydroconversion involves hydrogen-addition and it is the most commonly applied conversion technology to reduce the heteroatom content of petroleum feedstocks and to increase the H:C ratio of the products."
