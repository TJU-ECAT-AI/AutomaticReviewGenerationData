5.2 BITUMEN PRODUCTION FROM OILSANDS
Bitumen is recovered from Canadian oilsands in two ways. Deposits that are close to the surface employ surface mining to recover the oilsands, which are then extracted to recover the bitumen. Deposits that are deeper employ in situ extraction to recover the bitumen.
Mining of oilsands can be considered to a depth of 75 m. The in situ extraction of oilsands requires depths of 200 m or more. At present there is no economical technology for the recovery of bitumen from oilsands deposits that are (75200) m below the surface.

Oilsands bitumen is recovered from the ground through surface mining or in situ extraction methods. Surface mining can reach depths up to 75 meters, while in situ extraction targets depths greater than 200 meters. Currently, there is no economically viable method for extracting bitumen from deposits deeper than 75 to 200 meters below the surface.

油砂沥青通过露天开采或原位提取方法从地层中回收。露天开采可以达到75米以下，而原位提取则针对深度超过200米的区域。目前，还没有经济可行的方法来提取位于地面以下75到200米深处的沥青。

5.2.1 Extraction of Mined Oilsands
Open pit mining is the most economical recovery method of oilsands deposits that are close to the surface. Even with deposits close to the surface, there is some overburden material that does not contain oilsands, and that must be removed prior to recovery of the oilsands ore. The cost of mining increases as the ratio of the height of the over- burden material to the height of the oilsands ore layer increases. This ratio is also called the strip ratio. Oilsands mining operations have strip ratios mostly in the range (0.41.4) [10].
A block flow diagram illustrating the extraction process to recover bitumen from mined oilsands is given in Figure 5.2.

Surface mining is the most cost-effective method for recovering oilsands deposits near the surface. Despite being close to the surface, there is overburden material that does not contain oilsands, which needs to be removed before mining. The cost of mining rises as the ratio of the overburden material's height to the oilsands ore layer's height increases, known as the strip ratio. Oilsands mining typically has strip ratios ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 [10].

在接近地表的位置进行露天采矿是回收油砂矿床最经济的方法。尽管靠近地表，但仍存在不含油砂的覆盖物需要在采矿前移除。随着覆盖物高度与油砂矿层高度比例的增加，采矿成本上升，这一比例也被称为剥离比。油砂采矿通常的剥离比在0.4到1.4之间[10]。

5.2.2 In Situ Production
When oilsands deposits are too deep, mining methods to recover the ore for extraction becomes uneconomical. In order to recover bitumen from deeper oilsands deposits, the bitumen must be recovered without removing the mineral matter. The main challenge to the in situ produc- tion of the bitumen is finding an economical way to increase the fluidity of the bitumen, which is very viscous. The viscosity of the bitumen can be decreased by increasing the temperature or by dissolving the bitumen in a light solvent. Once the bitumen is fluid enough, it can be recovered from an oil well, analogous to conventional crude oil recovery.

当油砂沉积层太深无法实现经济性的开采时，就需要进行原位生产。目标是在不移除矿物的情况下提取沥青。主要挑战在于找到一种经济上可行的方式来提高沥青的流动性，因为沥青非常粘稠。可以通过提高温度或用轻质溶剂溶解沥青来实现这一点。一旦沥青足够流动，就可以通过油井回收，类似于常规原油的回收方式。
