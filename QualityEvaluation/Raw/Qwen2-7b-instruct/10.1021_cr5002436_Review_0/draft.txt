        Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are indispensable to the chemical industry due to their extensive use in producing polyolefins, solvents, and other chemical products. Their key production methods encompass steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and dehydrogenation, which are associated with thermodynamic challenges, particularly concerning temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects. Olefin/paraffin separation, a pivotal process in the petrochemical industry, confronts hurdles due to the high energy demands of traditional methods like cryogenic distillation. The integration of membrane separation processes offers a more energy-efficient alternative. The development of polymer-inorganic nano composite materials aims to augment the physical properties of polymer membranes, enhancing both selectivity and permeability. This advancement promises to significantly elevate the utilization of membrane technology in the petrochemical industry, addressing the limitations posed by insufficient gas flux in conventional separation techniques.
