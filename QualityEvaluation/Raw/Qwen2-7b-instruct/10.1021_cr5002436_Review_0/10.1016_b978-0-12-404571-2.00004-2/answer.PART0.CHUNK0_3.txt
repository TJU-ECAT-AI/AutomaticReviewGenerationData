[1] "The Antrim Shale gas, for example, has high nitrogen concentration, as does at least one well tested in the Barnett Shale formation."
[2] "The Marcellus Shale gas has relatively little carbon dioxide and nitrogen."
[3] "The Haynesville Shale gas resource is the newest shale area to be developed. It lies in northern Louisiana and East Texas. The formation is deep (.10,000 ft), with high bottomhole temperature (175C,350F), and high pressure (30004000 psi)."
[4] "The compositions have been normalized to the reported compounds."

1. The Antrim Shale gas exhibits a high nitrogen concentration, and similarly, at least one well tested in the Barnett Shale formation shows high nitrogen concentration.
2. The Marcellus Shale gas is characterized by relatively low levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
3. The Haynesville Shale gas resource is a recent development situated in northern Louisiana and East Texas. Its geological features include a depth of up to 10,000 feet, a high bottomhole temperature of 175 degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and high pressure ranging from 3000 to 4000 pounds per square inch (psi).
4. The reported compositions of the shale gas resources have been standardized to the reported compounds.

1. 安特里姆页岩气的氮浓度较高，至少在巴伦特页岩形成的一个井中也显示出较高的氮浓度。
2. 马塞勒斯页岩气含有相对较少的二氧化碳和氮。
3. 海恩斯维尔页岩气资源是一个最近开发的区域，位于路易斯安那州北部和东得克萨斯州。其地质特征包括深度可达10000英尺，底孔温度为175摄氏度或350华氏度，以及压力范围从3000到4000磅每平方英寸（psi）。
4. 报告的页岩气资源组成已经标准化到报告的化合物。
