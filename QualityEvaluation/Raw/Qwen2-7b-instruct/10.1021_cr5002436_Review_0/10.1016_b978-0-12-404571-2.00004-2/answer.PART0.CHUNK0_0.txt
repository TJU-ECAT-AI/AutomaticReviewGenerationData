[1] "Gas processing (gas treating, gas refining) usually involves the removal of (i) oil, (ii) water, (iii) elements such as sulfur, helium, and carbon dioxide, and (iv) natural gas liquids (see Chapter 6)."
[2] "In addition, it is often necessary to install scrubbers and heaters at or near the wellhead that serve primarily to remove sand and other large-particle impurities."
[3] "Gas processing equipment, whether in the field or at processing/treatment plants, assures that these requirements can be met."
[4] "While in most cases, processing facilities extract contaminants and higher-molecular weight hydrocarbons (natural gas liquids) from the gas stream, in a few cases, the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons may be blended into the gas stream to bring it within acceptable Btu levels."
[5] "In many instances, pressure relief at the wellhead will cause a natural separation of gas from oil (using a conventional closed tank, where gravity separates the gas hydrocarbons from the higher-boiling crude oil)."
[6] "In addition, the composition of the raw natural gas extracted from producing wells depends on the type, depth, and location of the underground deposit and the geology of the area, processing must offer several options (even though each option may be applied to a different degree) to accommodate the difference in composition of the extracted gas."

Gas processing involves the removal of various contaminants from natural gas, including oil, water, sulfur, helium, carbon dioxide, and natural gas liquids. To achieve this, processing facilities often employ equipment such as scrubbers and heaters to remove sand and other large-particle impurities. The processed gas is then blended with higher-molecular weight hydrocarbons to bring it within acceptable BTU levels. Additionally, pressure relief at the wellhead facilitates the natural separation of gas from oil. Given the variability in the composition of raw natural gas extracted from producing wells, processing must offer multiple options tailored to the specific composition of the extracted gas.

气体处理涉及从天然气中去除各种污染物，包括油、水、硫、氦气、二氧化碳和天然气液体。为此，处理设施通常采用过滤器和加热器等设备来去除沙和其他大颗粒杂质。处理后的气体随后可能与更高分子量的碳氢化合物混合，以达到可接受的BTU水平。此外，在井口释放压力可以实现气体与原油的自然分离。鉴于从生产井中提取的原始天然气成分的差异性，处理过程必须提供多种选项，以适应提取气体的不同组成。
