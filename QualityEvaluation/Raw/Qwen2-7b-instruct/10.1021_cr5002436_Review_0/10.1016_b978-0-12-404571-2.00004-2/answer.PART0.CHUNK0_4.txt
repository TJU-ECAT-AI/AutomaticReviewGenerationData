[1] "Gas processing (gas refining) consists of separating all of the various hydrocarbons, non-hydrocarbons (such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide), and fluids from the methane."
[2] "The actual practice of processing natural gas to high-quality pipeline gas for the consumer usually involves four main processes to remove the various impurities: (i) water removal, (ii) liquids removal, (iii) enrichment, (iv) fractionation, and (v) the process by which hydrogen sulfide is converted to sulfur (the Claus process)."
[3] "In many cases, the process complexities arise because of the need for recovery of the materials used to remove the contaminants or even for the recovery of the contaminants in the original, or altered, form."

The light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry due to their extensive applications and market trends. They are widely used in the production of polymers, synthetic fibers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Key production methods include steam cracking, which involves breaking down heavier hydrocarbons into lighter olefins under high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges in the synthesis of light olefins include managing the right balance between temperature and pressure to maximize yield while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. Alkane chain length affects the efficiency of cracking processes; longer chains require higher temperatures and pressures to achieve the desired conversion rates. These factors necessitate precise control in industrial processes to ensure optimal production and cost-effectiveness.
