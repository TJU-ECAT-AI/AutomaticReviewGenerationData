1. Gas processing, or refining, typically includes removing oil, water, sulfur, helium, carbon dioxide, and natural gas liquids (Chapter 6). Scrubbers and heaters are often installed near the wellhead to eliminate sand and other large particles. Various chemical processes are utilized for gas processing, ranging from straightforward wash operations to intricate multi-stage recycling systems (Mokhatab et al., 2006; Speight, 2007, 2014). Initially, natural gas undergoes some cleaning at the wellhead. Process complexities often stem from the necessity to recover materials used for contaminant removal or the contaminants themselves in their original or modified form (Kohl and Riesenfeld, 1985; Mokhatab et al., 2006; Newman, 1985).

1. 天然气处理，或精炼，通常包括去除油、水、硫、氦、二氧化碳和天然气液体（第6章）。经常在井口附近安装洗涤器和加热器以去除砂和其他大颗粒杂质。用于天然气处理的各种化学过程包括从简单的一次性冲洗操作到复杂的多步骤循环系统（Mokhatab et al., 2006；Speight, 2007, 2014）。最初，在井口对天然气进行一定程度的清洁。过程复杂性往往源于回收用于去除污染物的材料，甚至是回收原始或修改后的污染物的必要性（Kohl和Riesenfeld, 1985；Mokhatab et al., 2006；Newman, 1985）。

Answer: The light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in sectors like plastics, synthetic fibers, and pharmaceuticals. Their demand has been growing, particularly with advancements in polymer technology. Key production methods involve catalytic processes, such as the steam cracking of naphtha, which transforms long-chain hydrocarbons into shorter, more reactive olefins under high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges are significant, as the efficiency of the process relies heavily on optimizing conditions like temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chains. Temperature affects the rate of cracking reactions, with higher temperatures promoting faster reactions but also risking the formation of undesirable byproducts. Pressure impacts the equilibrium of the reactions, favoring the production of olefins at elevated pressures. The chain length of the starting hydrocarbons determines the yield of the desired olefin, necessitating precise control over the cracking process to achieve optimal output.
