[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They are widely used in the manufacture of plastics, synthetic fibers, detergents, and rubber."
[2] "The key production methods for these olefins involve steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and thermal cracking."
[3] "Temperature and pressure significantly influence the synthesis of olefins. Higher temperatures typically increase the cracking rates, leading to faster production. However, they also risk the formation of unwanted byproducts."
[4] "Pressure plays a critical role in the efficiency of the cracking process. Lower pressures allow for a higher yield of olefins, but they also increase the energy requirements for the reaction."
[5] "The length of the alkane chain affects the selectivity of the cracking process. Longer chains require higher temperatures and pressures to crack efficiently."
