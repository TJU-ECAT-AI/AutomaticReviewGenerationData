<quotes>
[1] "Articles in Russkij Vstnik, the journal in which Leo Tolstoys Anna Karenina first appeared, not only condemned the Turks for their invasion of the Slavic world but also described them as belonging to an Asian tribe incapable of becoming truly civilized like the European peoples to which many Russians felt they belonged."
[2] "In the same vein, articles in Deutsche Rundschau, the journal that first published Theodor Fontanes Effi Briest, not only reported on the Sino- Japanese War but also expressed German apprehensions about a growing power in Asia that might limit or even destroy European civilization."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Russo-Turkish War and the Sino-Japanese War made headlines even in such journals as the Russian Russkij Vstnik and the German Deutsche Rundschau, both of which dealt as much with culture and literature as with politics. In both cases, negative views of Asia presented in various articles reverberated also throughout the fictive societies of the nineteenth-century novels of adultery printed alongside them in serial format.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
俄罗斯《俄罗斯电讯报》和德国《德意志评论报》等期刊上关于俄土战争和日俄战争的报道，不仅涉及政治，也触及文化和文学领域。在这些连载小说的社会中，刊载在它们旁边的小说中，亚洲的负面观点在文章的影响下回响。

<quotes>
[1] "In fact, they are anything but model Christians. Anna notices that Lydia Ivanovna believes herself to be Christian but always has enemies in the name of Christianity."
[2] "For the press, war simply means doubled earnings."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Many characters in Anna Karenina exhibit a superficial commitment to Christianity, often using religious rhetoric for personal gain or to maintain appearances. The press, similarly, uses the war as an opportunity for financial gain.

<quotes>
[1] "While it is not difficult to find the correlation between threatening Asiatic Turks described in articles in Russkij Vstnik and the preparations for war against Turks taking place in Anna Karenina, the danger that the Chinese ghost in Effi Briest poses is more subtly suggested."
[2] "Effi hears about the Chinese man on the way to her new home in the port-town of Kessin in East Pommerania."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Chinese ghost in Effi Briest embodies a more nuanced threat, reflecting the complex and subtle anxieties about German-Asian relations that emerged in the context of the Sino-Japanese War.

费菲在前往东波美拉尼亚州克辛的港口小镇新家的路上听到了这个中国人。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "Because the Prussian society Fontane portrays dictates that a young woman like Effi marry an older, more established man like Innstetten, it seemingly condemns her to future marital strife, if not to the very affair for which the novel is known."
[2] "She has good reason to fear the Chinese ghost in her bedroom, therefore, because his unusual background makes him attractive to someone with her tastes."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Effi's society, as depicted by Fontane, prescribes a path of marriage to an older, established man like Innstetten, which seems to doom her to future marital conflicts, including the very affair that the novel is renowned for. Her fascination with the Chinese ghost in her bedroom is understandable given the unconventional nature of his background, which aligns with her preferences.

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are indispensable elements in the chemical industry, serving as foundational materials for the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and various other chemical products. Their market dynamics are closely aligned with global demands for petrochemical products. The manufacturing of these olefins usually entails the thermal cracking of heavier hydrocarbon compounds derived from crude oil refinement. To achieve optimal yield and product purity, production processes necessitate meticulous control over factors such as temperature, pressure, and the selection of catalysts. The length of alkane chains impacts the selectivity of the cracking reaction, affecting the distribution of olefin products. Managing the exothermic nature of the cracking process to prevent runaway reactions is a significant thermodynamic challenge. Higher temperatures enhance reaction speed but may increase energy consumption. Pressure adjustments are vital for controlling the extent of the cracking reaction and the formation of byproducts, necessitating a balanced approach to maximize yield and selectivity. Catalyst design plays a crucial role, with materials like zeolites and metals tailored for specific operational conditions.
