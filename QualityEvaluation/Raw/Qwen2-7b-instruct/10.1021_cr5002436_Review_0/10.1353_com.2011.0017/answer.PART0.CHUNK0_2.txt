Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are indispensable elements in the chemical industry, serving as foundational materials for the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and various other chemical products. Their market dynamics are closely aligned with global demands for petrochemical products. The manufacturing of these olefins usually entails the thermal cracking of heavier hydrocarbon compounds derived from crude oil refinement. To achieve optimal yield and product purity, production processes necessitate meticulous control over factors such as temperature, pressure, and the selection of catalysts. The length of alkane chains impacts the selectivity of the cracking reaction, affecting the distribution of olefin products. Managing the exothermic nature of the cracking process to prevent runaway reactions is a significant thermodynamic challenge. Higher temperatures enhance reaction speed but may increase energy consumption. Pressure adjustments are vital for controlling the extent of the cracking reaction and the formation of byproducts, necessitating a balanced approach to maximize yield and selectivity. Catalyst design plays a crucial role, with materials like zeolites and metals tailored for specific operational conditions.
