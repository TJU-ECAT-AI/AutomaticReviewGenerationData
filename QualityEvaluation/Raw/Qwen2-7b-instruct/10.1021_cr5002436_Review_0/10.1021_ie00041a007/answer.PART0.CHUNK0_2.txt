[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the petrochemical industry. They are used in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents."
[2] "Propylene and ethylene are primarily synthesized through steam cracking of hydrocarbons. The process involves heating hydrocarbons to high temperatures, typically around 800°C, under low pressures, usually below 5 bar."
[3] "Temperature plays a significant role in olefin synthesis. Higher temperatures enhance the cracking of hydrocarbons, increasing the yield of light olefins. However, too high a temperature can lead to the formation of coke, which can clog the equipment and reduce efficiency."
[4] "Pressure has a lesser impact on the synthesis of light olefins compared to temperature. Lower pressures facilitate the cracking process but can result in a less efficient separation of the desired products from heavier hydrocarbons."
[5] "The chain length of the alkane feedstock affects the selectivity towards light olefins. Longer-chain alkanes require higher temperatures to achieve the same yield of light olefins, making the process more energy-intensive."

1. Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are essential for manufacturing plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents in the petrochemical industry. 
2. Propylene and ethylene are typically produced via steam cracking of hydrocarbons, a process conducted at high temperatures around 800°C and low pressures under 5 bar.
3. Temperature significantly influences olefin synthesis, enhancing the cracking of hydrocarbons and increasing the yield of light olefins, though excessively high temperatures can lead to coke formation, obstructing equipment and decreasing efficiency.
4. Pressure has a lesser effect on olefin synthesis compared to temperature. Lower pressures support the cracking process but may result in less efficient separation of desired products from heavier hydrocarbons.
5. The chain length of the alkane feedstock impacts the selectivity towards light olefins. Longer-chain alkanes demand higher temperatures to achieve equivalent light olefin yields, making the process more energetically demanding.

1. 轻烯烃如丙烯和乙烯对石化行业至关重要，用于生产塑料、合成纤维和溶剂。
2. 丙烯和乙烯通常通过蒸汽裂解烃类产生，该过程在约800°C的高温和低于5巴的压力下进行。
3. 温度显著影响烯烃合成，促进烃类裂解并增加轻烯烃的产率，但过高的温度可能导致焦炭形成，阻塞设备并降低效率。
4. 压力相对于温度而言对轻烯烃合成的影响较小。较低的压力支持裂解过程，但可能导致难以有效分离所需产品与较重的烃类。
5. 烷烃进料的链长影响轻烯烃的选择性。较长链烷烃需要更高的温度来实现等效的轻烯烃产率，使得过程更加能耗密集。
