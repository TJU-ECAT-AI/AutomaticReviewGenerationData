1. The main challenge in utilizing CO2 widely is its low atmospheric concentration, making up just 0.03% of the air.

2. The rate at which a Mn-Cr-O/SiOz catalyst reduces by ethane is nearly equivalent to its reoxidation by CO2.

3. The rate at which a catalyst reduces by ethane matches closely with its reoxidation by CO2.

4. The use of catalysts composed of manganese and chromium oxides enables ethylene to be converted into butadiene and propylene, with a reduced CO concentration.

1. 利用CO2广泛的主要障碍是其在大气中的浓度极低，仅占0.03%。

2. Mn-Cr-O/SiOz催化剂由乙烯还原到重新氧化CO2的速度几乎相等。

3. 催化剂由乙烷还原到CO2重新氧化的速度相近。

4. 含有锰和铬氧化物的催化剂使乙烯转化为丁二烯和丙烯，并降低了CO浓度。
