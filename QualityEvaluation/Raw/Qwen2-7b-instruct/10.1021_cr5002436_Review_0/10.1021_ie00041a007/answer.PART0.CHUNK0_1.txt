<p>Redox reactions with the participation of C02 as an oxidant are more representative in this respect for large- scale C02 use.

1. Hydrocarbons, especially from natural sources like petroleum and natural gas, can be used as reducers in reactions with carbon dioxide (CO2). Hydrogen is the best reducing agent for CO2, but its direct utilization in certain reactions leads to the formation of water, making hydrocarbons a more attractive option.
2. Numerous studies have focused on incorporating CO2 into complexes of transition metals with organic ligands. These studies have explored the synthesis of various organic compounds from CO2.
3. In reactions involving ethane and CO2, no inhibitory action of ethane (C2H6) was observed. 
4. The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by CO2 can be described by an equation involving rate constants for catalyst oxidation (kox) and reduction (kred). This equation explains the observed decrease in selectivity with increasing conversion, likely due to the formation of a product (COY) that inhibits the reaction.

1. 烃类，尤其是来自石油和天然气等天然来源的烃类，可以作为与二氧化碳反应的还原剂。氢是二氧化碳的最佳还原剂，但在某些反应中直接使用氢会导致水的生成，使烃类成为更吸引人的选择。
2. 大量研究集中在将二氧化碳引入过渡金属与有机配体的复合物中。这些研究探索了从二氧化碳合成各种有机化合物的可能性。
3. 在涉及乙烷和二氧化碳的反应中，没有观察到乙烷（C2H6）的抑制作用。
4. 乙烷通过二氧化碳的脱氢速率可以用一个方程式描述，该方程涉及催化剂氧化（kox）和还原（kred）的速率常数。这个方程解释了随着转化率增加，选择性降低的现象，这可能是由于产物（COY）的存在抑制了反应。
