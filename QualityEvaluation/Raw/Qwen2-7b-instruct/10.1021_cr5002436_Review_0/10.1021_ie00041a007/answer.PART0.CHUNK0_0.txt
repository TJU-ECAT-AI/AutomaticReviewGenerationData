[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are fundamental building blocks in the chemical industry. They are used in the production of a wide range of plastics, solvents, synthetic fibers, and fuels."
[2] "The key production methods for light olefins involve thermal cracking of heavier hydrocarbons, such as naphtha or heavy oil, and steam cracking of naphtha or natural gas. These processes require high temperatures and pressures to break down the larger hydrocarbon chains into smaller olefin molecules."
[3] "Thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins include optimizing temperature and pressure conditions to achieve maximum olefin yield while minimizing the formation of byproducts. Longer alkane chains generally require higher temperatures and pressures for efficient cracking."

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They are employed in the manufacturing of various plastics, solvents, synthetic fibers, and fuels. Their synthesis typically involves thermal or steam cracking of larger hydrocarbon molecules, such as naphtha or heavy oil, and natural gas under high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges include setting optimal conditions to maximize olefin yield and minimize byproduct formation, with longer alkane chains often requiring higher processing temperatures and pressures.
