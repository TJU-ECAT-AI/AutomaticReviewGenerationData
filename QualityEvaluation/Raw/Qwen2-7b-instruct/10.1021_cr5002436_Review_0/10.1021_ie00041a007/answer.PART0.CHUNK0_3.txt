Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive use in various applications such as plastic manufacturing, synthetic fiber production, and solvent industries. The key production methods often involve the cracking of heavier hydrocarbons under high temperatures and pressures. The thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis relate to optimizing the balance between the desired olefin yields and minimizing the formation of unwanted by-products, such as coke deposits. Temperature and pressure conditions significantly affect olefin yields; higher temperatures generally enhance olefin production but may also lead to increased coke formation. Alkane chain length impacts the selectivity towards lighter versus heavier olefins, with longer chains requiring more severe conditions for efficient cracking. The literature highlights the use of manganese oxide-based catalysts for the oxidative transformation of hydrocarbons and alcohols with carbon dioxide, showing their effectiveness in producing light olefins through redox reactions. These catalysts, especially those containing manganese and chromium oxides, demonstrate high conversions and selectivities, particularly for the conversion of heavier alkanes like heptane into lighter olefins and alkanes without coke formation. The use of catalysts like 5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOz has been found to be highly effective for the production of C4H4, with selectivities reaching up to 76.8%. The literature also discusses the role of rare earth oxides, such as lanthanum, in forming catalysts for CO2 interaction with hydrocarbons and alcohols, highlighting their potential in the oxidative transformation of organic compounds.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们广泛应用于塑料制造、合成纤维生产和溶剂行业等。主要生产方法通常涉及在高温高压下裂解重质烃类。合成这些烯烃的热力学挑战主要在于优化所需烯烃产率与避免生成副产品（如焦炭沉积）之间的平衡。温度和压力条件显著影响烯烃产率；较高的温度通常能提高烯烃产量，但也可能导致焦炭形成增加。烷烃链长影响轻烯烃与重烯烃的选择性，较长的链需要更严重的条件以高效裂解。文献强调使用锰氧化物基催化剂对碳二氧化合物的氧化转换，显示出在生产轻烯烃时通过还原反应的有效性。特别是含有锰和铬氧化物的催化剂，在转化较重的烷烃如庚烷为较轻的烯烃和烷烃时，显示出高转化率和选择性，且无焦炭沉积。文献还讨论了镧等稀土氧化物在形成与烃类和醇类CO2相互作用的催化剂中的潜力，以及它们在有机化合物氧化转换过程中的潜在应用。
