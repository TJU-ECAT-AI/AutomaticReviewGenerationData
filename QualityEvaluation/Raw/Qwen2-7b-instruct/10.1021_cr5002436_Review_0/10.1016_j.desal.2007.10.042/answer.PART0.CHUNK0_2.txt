<p>During the years, different processes have been used for the separation of olefin-paraffin mixtures, such as low-temperature distillation, extractive distillation, physical or chemical adsorption and physical or chemical absorption.</p>
<p>Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process. This large capital expense and energy cost have created incentive for extensive research in this area.</p>
<p>Separation of olefin and paraffin gases is one of the most important processes in the petrochemical industry. In 1998, the United States produced 52 billion pounds of ethylene and 29 billion pounds of propylene.</p>
<p>Various petrochemical streams contain olefin and other saturated hydrocarbons. These streams typically originate from steam cracking units (ethylene production), catalytic cracking units (motor gasoline production), or the dehydrogenation of paraffins.</p>
<p>The process of gas permeation is a relatively simple process which has expanded in use rapidly since it was introduced commercially in 1979. Since that time approximately 20 or more companies have come to the market place with equipment. The range of applications covers the supply of pure or enriched gases such as He, N2 and O2 from air, the separation of acid gases such as CO2 and H2S, the separation of H2 in the petrochemical and chemical industries and a variety of smaller applications.</p>

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute significantly to the chemical industry due to their wide applications in producing polyolefins like polyethylene and polypropylene. They are also essential for the synthesis of styrene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. Market trends show that the production of these olefins reached 52 billion pounds of ethylene and 29 billion pounds of propylene in the United States in 1998. The key production methods involve steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and dehydrogenation of paraffins. The thermodynamic challenges mainly relate to the low relative volatilities of components, which require cryogenic distillation. This process is highly energy-intensive, leading to significant capital expenses and energy costs. As a result, extensive research has been conducted on alternative separation techniques, including membrane separations, which are energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.

2. The separation of olefin-paraffin mixtures is a critical process in the petrochemical industry. Historically, methods such as low-temperature distillation, extractive distillation, physical or chemical adsorption, and physical or chemical absorption have been utilized. Currently, cryogenic distillation is the predominant method due to its efficiency in separating components at low temperatures. However, this process is energy-intensive, requiring significant capital investment and energy consumption. This has spurred research into alternative methods like membrane separation, which offers a simpler, less energy-consuming approach compared to traditional distillation techniques.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，对化工行业有重大贡献，主要体现在它们在生产聚烯烃（如聚乙烯和聚丙烯）中的广泛应用。此外，它们对于合成苯乙烯、乙二醇、丙烯腈和异丙醇也至关重要。1998年，美国的乙烯产量达到52亿磅，丙烯产量为29亿磅，显示了市场趋势。关键生产方法包括蒸汽裂解、催化裂解和烷基化。热力学挑战主要与组分的低相对挥发性有关，这要求采用低温精馏。这个过程耗能巨大，导致了显著的资本投入和能源消耗。因此，进行了大量关于替代分离技术的研究，如膜分离，这些技术相比传统蒸馏技术更为节能且环境友好。

2. 在石油化工行业中，烯烃-烷烃混合物的分离是一个非常重要的过程。历史上，已使用的方法包括低温蒸馏、萃取蒸馏、物理或化学吸附和物理或化学吸收。目前，由于其在低温下的高效分离能力，低温精馏是主要的分离方法。然而，这一过程能耗高，需要大量的资本投资和能源消耗。因此，研究转向了替代方法，如膜分离，这种方法相比传统蒸馏技术更简单、能耗更低。
