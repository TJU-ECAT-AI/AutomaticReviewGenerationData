[1] "In 1998, the United States produced 52 billion pounds of ethylene and 29 billion pounds of propylene."
[2] "Various petrochemical streams contain olefin and other saturated hydrocarbons. These streams typically originate from steam cracking units (ethylene production), catalytic cracking units (motor gasoline production), or the dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[3] "Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."
[4] "In searching for membrane materials, one generally looks not only for a favorable combination of required permeability and selectivity, but also for an improvement in mechanical properties of the membrane."
[5] "Recently, polymer-inorganic nano composite materials have been developed to improve the physical properties of polymer membranes."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They are used in the production of polyolefins, including polyethylene and polypropylene, which are fundamental materials for various applications. Ethylene and propylene are key chemicals for producing styrene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. In terms of market trends, the demand for these olefins has been growing steadily due to their widespread use in the manufacture of plastics, packaging, and numerous other products. 

The key production methods involve steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and dehydrogenation of paraffins. These processes require high temperatures and pressures, with the relative volatility of components being a significant thermodynamic challenge. Longer alkane chains can lead to lower separation efficiencies, necessitating more complex processes or higher energy inputs.

Distillation, traditionally used for separating olefin-paraffin mixtures, is highly energy-intensive. This has led to the consideration of alternative separation methods, including membrane separations. Researchers are looking for materials that offer a favorable combination of permeability and selectivity, as well as improved mechanical properties. Polymer-inorganic nano composite materials are emerging as promising solutions to enhance the performance of membrane separators.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中至关重要。它们被用于生产聚烯烃，包括聚乙烯和聚丙烯，这些都是广泛应用于各种应用的基本材料。乙烯和丙烯是生产苯乙烯、乙二醇、丙烯腈和异丙醇的关键化学物质。在市场趋势方面，由于这些烯烃在塑料、包装等众多产品中的广泛应用，对它们的需求持续增长。

主要的生产方法包括蒸汽裂解、催化裂化和烷烃脱氢。这些过程需要高温和高压，相对挥发度的成分是一个重要的热力学挑战。较长的碳链可能导致分离效率降低，需要更复杂的流程或更高的能量输入。

传统上用于分离烯烃-饱和烃混合物的蒸馏过程高度耗能。这导致考虑替代分离方法，包括膜分离。研究人员正在寻找提供渗透性和选择性良好组合以及改进膜材料机械性能的材料。聚合物-无机纳米复合材料正在成为提高膜分离器性能的有前景的解决方案。
