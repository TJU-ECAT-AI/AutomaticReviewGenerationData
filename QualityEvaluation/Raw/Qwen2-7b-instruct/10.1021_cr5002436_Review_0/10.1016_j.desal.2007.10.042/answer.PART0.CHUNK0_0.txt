Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry. They are extensively used in the production of polyolefins, including polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as in the creation of styrene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. The key production methods involve processes like steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and dehydrogenation. Thermodynamic challenges are associated with these processes, particularly concerning temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects. For instance, olefin/paraffin separation, which is critical in petrochemical industry, faces challenges due to the high energy demand of traditional separation methods like cryogenic distillation. The use of membrane separation processes offers an energy-efficient alternative. The application of polymer-inorganic nano composite materials aims to enhance the physical properties of polymer membranes, improving both selectivity and permeability. This development could significantly advance the use of membrane technology in petrochemical industries, addressing the limitations posed by insufficient gas flux in conventional separation methods.
