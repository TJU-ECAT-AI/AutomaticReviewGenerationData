1. Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry. They are fundamental in the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, which are widely used in packaging, construction, and various consumer goods. Ethylene and propylene are also essential for producing styrene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. The market trend indicates a significant demand for these olefins, with substantial production in the petrochemical sector.

2. The key production methods involve steam cracking units for ethylene production and catalytic cracking units for motor gasoline production. The thermodynamic challenges relate to the separation of olefin-paraffin mixtures, which can be energy-intensive due to the high energy input required for distillation processes. Membrane separation processes are considered as an attractive alternative for achieving efficient and cost-effective separation.

3. Researchers have used various polymeric membranes to investigate the performance of propylene/propane separation systems. These studies highlight the importance of finding a favorable combination of permeability and selectivity in membrane materials.

4. Polymer-inorganic nano composite materials have been developed to enhance the physical properties of polymer membranes. These advancements aim to improve the separation efficiency of olefin/paraffin mixtures, addressing the limitations associated with insufficient gas flux in conventional polymeric membranes.
