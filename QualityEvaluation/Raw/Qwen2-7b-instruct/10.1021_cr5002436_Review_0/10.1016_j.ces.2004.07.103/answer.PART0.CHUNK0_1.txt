[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[6] "Each reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane dehydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally followed by a catalyst reduction."
[7] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[8] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[9] "Raman spectroscopy is an excellent method to track the different types of coke as they are being deposited on the catalyst."
[10] "Coke is a crucial parameter for the activity of the catalyst. A small amount of coke increases the activity, while it becomes a deactivating agent as the coke content increases."

The chemical industry relies heavily on light olefins such as propylene and ethylene for various applications due to their versatility and wide range of uses. These olefins are essential components in numerous industries including petrochemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. The market trends for these olefins are closely tied to the growing demand for plastics and packaging materials, among other products. The synthesis of these olefins, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, involves complex chemical reactions that are thermodynamically challenging. Key factors influencing the process include temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chains. For instance, the Catofin process utilizes a chromium oxide catalyst operating at around 850 K and subatmospheric pressures of 0.2 to 0.5 bar. The catalyst's activity is impacted by two main factors: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of chromium from Cr(VI) to Cr(III). High temperatures during coke combustion accelerate the migration of chromium into the alumina support, affecting catalyst performance. Raman spectroscopy is employed to monitor the types of coke deposited on the catalyst, highlighting the critical role of coke in catalytic activity. A small amount of coke can enhance activity, whereas excessive amounts lead to deactivation. The coke profile indicates that it forms predominantly from propene rather than propane, with the coke becoming increasingly graphitic over time. This information is vital for adjusting process parameters such as cycle times to optimize catalyst efficiency and maintain desired conversion levels.

化学工业在多个应用领域依赖轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，由于它们的多功能性和广泛用途。这些烯烃是塑料、包装材料等众多行业的重要组成部分。丙烯和乙烯的市场趋势与对塑料和包装材料需求的增长紧密相关。这些烯烃的合成，特别是通过丙烷脱氢过程，涉及复杂的化学反应，具有热力学挑战性。关键因素影响包括温度、压力以及烷烃链长。例如，Catofin工艺使用850 K左右的温度和0.2至0.5巴的亚大气压，包含铬氧化物的催化剂。催化剂的活性受两个主要因素的影响：催化剂上的焦炭形成和六价铬还原为三价铬。焦炭燃烧时的高温加速了铬向氧化铝支持体的迁移，影响催化剂性能。采用拉曼光谱监测催化剂上的不同类型焦炭沉积，突显了焦炭在催化活性中的关键作用。少量焦炭可以增强活性，而过多的焦炭导致活性下降。焦炭分布显示，它主要由丙烯而不是丙烷形成，并随着时间推移逐渐变为石墨状。这些信息对于调整工艺参数，如循环时间，以优化催化剂效率并保持所需转化水平至关重要。
