[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[6] "Each reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane de- hydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally followed by a catalyst reduction."
[7] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[8] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[9] "Raman spectroscopy is an excellent method to track the different types of coke as they are being deposited on the catalyst."
[10] "During the first 2 h of dehydrogenation there is a slow formation of coke on the catalyst, while at the same time the catalytic activity increases."
[11] "Considering that the catalyst was already reduced in a very short time and that the catalyst is not being reduced further than to Cr(III), the most probable explanation for the increase in activity is that coke in some way is beneficial for the catalytic activity."
[12] "Having knowledge on coke quantities on the catalyst can help to adjust cycle times for a process like Catofin. Cycle times can be extended if one observes that a larger amount of coke will utilize the catalyst longer in a more active state, or cycle times can be reduced if the amount of coke accumulating on the catalyst will be resulting in too much heat liberated during the regeneration phase."

The chemical industry utilizes light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, extensively in various applications due to their versatile properties and high demand. These olefins are primarily synthesized through processes like steam cracking of naphtha, ethane, or propane, and through the dehydrogenation of paraffins. Steam cracking involves breaking down hydrocarbons into olefins and hydrogen at high temperatures, typically around 850 K, and pressures of 0.20.5 bar. The dehydrogenation process converts paraffins into olefins under similar conditions. Key thermodynamic challenges in these processes include maintaining optimal reaction temperatures and pressures to maximize yield while minimizing energy consumption. The length of the alkane chain influences the efficiency of these reactions, with longer chains requiring higher temperatures and pressures for cracking. Coke formation, a byproduct of incomplete reactions, can deplete catalyst activity over time. The Catofin process uses a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst, which undergoes a series of cycles involving dehydrogenation, regeneration, and possibly reduction. The formation of coke on the catalyst is a significant factor affecting its activity, with a small amount potentially enhancing it and excessive amounts deactivating it. Understanding the coke content allows for adjustments to process parameters, such as cycle times, to optimize catalyst performance and efficiency.

化学工业广泛利用轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在各种应用中，由于它们的多功能性和高需求。这些烯烃主要通过蒸汽裂解石脑油、乙烷或丙烷以及通过烷烃的脱氢作用合成。蒸汽裂解在大约850 K的高温和0.2至0.5 bar的压力下分解烃类，生成烯烃和氢气。脱氢过程在相似条件下将烷烃转化为烯烃。这些过程中热力学挑战的关键在于在最大化产率的同时最小化能耗下保持理想的反应温度和压力。烷烃链的长度影响反应效率，更长的链需要更高的温度和压力进行裂解。焦炭形成是不完全反应的副产品，会消耗催化剂活性。Catofin过程使用氧化铬在氧化铝催化剂，经历一系列循环包括脱氢、再生和可能的还原。催化剂上焦炭的形成是影响其活性的重要因素，少量可能会增强活性，而大量则会使其失效。了解焦炭含量允许对过程参数进行调整，如循环时间，以优化催化剂性能和效率。
