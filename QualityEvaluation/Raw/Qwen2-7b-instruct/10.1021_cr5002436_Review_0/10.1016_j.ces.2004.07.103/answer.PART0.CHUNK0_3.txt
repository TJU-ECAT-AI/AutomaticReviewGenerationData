[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003)."
[2] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) (Bhasin et al., 2001)."
[3] "Each reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane de- hydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally followed by a catalyst reduction."
[4] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[5] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[6] "A small amount of coke improves its activity,most likely by an improved adsorption of propane on the catalyst, but the activity of the catalyst drops when the amount of coke exceeds a certain value."
[7] "Using cheap and robust spectroscopic probes linked via optical fibers to a spectrometer, one can gain information on how changes or disturbances to a process affect the amount of coke produced."

The chemical industry relies heavily on light olefins such as propylene and ethylene, which are key components in the production of numerous petrochemical products. They are used extensively in the manufacturing of plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and many other chemical derivatives. The demand for these olefins has grown considerably over the last decade, surpassing the supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers (FCCs).

One of the processes utilized for the synthesis of propylene is the Catofin process, developed by ABB Lummus. This process involves a series of reactions that take place in a series of reactors, each undergoing cycles that include dehydrogenation, regeneration, and reduction stages. The catalyst activity during the dehydrogenation cycle fluctuates due to two primary factors: the formation of coke on the catalyst surface and the reduction of chromium from Cr(VI) to Cr(III). High temperatures during the combustion of coke can expedite the migration of chromium into the alumina support, impacting the catalyst's performance.

An optimal amount of coke on the catalyst can enhance its activity, possibly by improving the adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface. However, once the coke content surpasses a critical threshold, the catalyst's performance diminishes. Operando spectroscopy, employing UVVis and Raman techniques, provides a direct method to monitor the catalyst's state in real-time. This allows for adjustments to process parameters, such as cycle times, pressure, temperature, and feedrates, to maintain optimal performance. Cheap and robust UV-Vis probes, connected via optical fibers to a spectrometer, enable the detection of coke formation and its impact on the catalyst's efficiency, facilitating informed decision-making to sustain the most active catalyst state.

化学工业对轻烯烃如丙烯和乙烯的需求显著增长，超过了传统来源（乙烷蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化）提供的数量。这些烯烃广泛用于塑料、合成纤维等众多化工产品的生产。

丙烯的合成过程之一是Catofin工艺，由ABB Lummus开发。该工艺在一系列反应器中进行，每个反应器都经历包括脱氢、再生和还原在内的循环周期。催化剂在脱氢周期中的活性波动主要由于催化剂表面焦炭的形成和铬从Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)两个原因。焦炭燃烧时的高温可以加速铬向氧化铝支撑物的迁移，影响催化剂性能。

适量的焦炭可以提高催化剂的活性，可能通过改善丙烯吸附到催化剂表面的方式。然而，一旦焦炭含量超过一定值，催化剂的性能会下降。原位光谱分析，利用UVVis和拉曼技术，可以直接监测催化剂状态，实时获取信息。这使得调整工艺参数，如循环时间、压力、温度和进料率成为可能，以维持最佳性能。便宜且坚固的UV-Vis探头通过光纤连接到光谱仪，能够检测焦炭形成及其对催化剂效率的影响，从而做出明智的决策，以保持最活跃的催化剂状态。
