[6] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[7] "During the first 2 h it increases and then goes down slowly. The initially high conversion at t = 0 is caused by the combustion of some propane as it reduced the catalyst."

How do light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends, and what are the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects?

The demand for propene has significantly increased over the past decade, surpassing the supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. One of the processes for dehydrogenating propane to produce propene is the Catofin process, which uses 5 cyclically operated reactors. The process is run at a temperature of approximately 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar. 

UVVis spectroscopy is used to monitor the oxidation state of the catalyst, tracking the chromium through its redox cycle. Raman spectroscopy helps in identifying the types of coke deposited on the catalyst. High temperatures during coke combustion accelerate the migration of chromium into the alumina support. 

Initially, the conversion increases during the first 2 hours, caused by the combustion of some propane reducing the catalyst. The hydrogen produced exceeds the amount of propene by 15%, confirming the formation of coke. The conversion and selectivity obtained in the study are significantly different from those reported in the industry for the Catofin process.

The production of propylene and ethylene involves understanding their thermodynamic properties, especially in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. The key challenge lies in achieving optimal conditions for efficient conversion while minimizing energy consumption and waste generation. The study highlights the importance of monitoring the catalyst's activity and coke content in real-time to optimize the process and enhance efficiency.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中的应用和市场趋势如何？它们的合成关键生产方法及其与温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的热力学挑战是什么？

过去十年间，对丙烯的需求显著增加，超过了由传统来源（如蒸汽裂解炉和流化床催化裂解炉）提供的量。丙烷脱氢生产丙烯的一种过程是Catofin工艺，它使用5个循环操作的反应器。该过程在约850 K的温度和亚大气压（0.20.5 bar）下运行。

紫外可见光谱法用于监控催化剂的氧化态，跟踪催化剂中的铬通过其氧化还原周期。拉曼光谱有助于识别沉积在催化剂上的不同类型的焦炭。在焦炭燃烧过程中，高温加速了铬向氧化铝支撑物的迁移。

初始阶段，在前2小时内，转化率逐渐增加，这是由于一些丙烷的燃烧减少了催化剂。产生的氢气比丙烯多15%，这证实了焦炭的形成。研究中获得的转化率和选择性与行业报告的Catofin工艺系统显著不同。

丙烯和乙烯的生产涉及理解它们的热力学性质，尤其是与温度、压力和烷烃链长的关系。关键挑战在于在确保高效转化的同时，最小化能源消耗和废物生成。研究表明，实时监测催化剂活性和焦炭含量对于优化过程并提高效率至关重要。
