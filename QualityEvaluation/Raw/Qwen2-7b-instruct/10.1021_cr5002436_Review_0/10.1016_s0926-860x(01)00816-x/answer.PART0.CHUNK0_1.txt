1. In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is housed in a shallow bed within a reactor that can be spherical, squat vertical cylindrical, or horizontal. The design balances gas flow distribution across the reactor's cross-section with minimizing pressure drop. 

2. A significant quantity of coke accumulates during the dehydrogenation step, necessitating parallel operation of multiple reactors: some for dehydrogenation, others for regeneration or purging.

3. The reactor cycle duration is constrained by heat availability, typically lasting 10 to 20 minutes.

4. For propane dehydrogenation, a four-stage reactor system is more cost-effective due to the necessity for higher average temperatures.

5. A multi-stage reactor system allows for lower initial temperatures compared to a single stage system.

6. As of late 2000, over 30 commercial units utilizing platinum catalysts for detergent alkylate production were operational.

7. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation markedly rises with increasing carbon number.

8. The production of olefins must maintain high yields over extended periods without interruptions.

9. The selection of the appropriate reactor configuration depends on the catalyst type and operational parameters.

1. 在使用铬铝催化剂的脱氢过程中，催化剂被放置在一个浅床中，位于反应器内部，该反应器可以是球形、矮直筒形或水平形。设计考虑了气体在反应器横截面上的分布与降低压降之间的折衷。

2. 在脱氢步骤期间，大量的焦炭沉积在催化剂上，因此需要并行操作多个反应器：一些用于脱氢，其他用于再生或排空。

3. 反应器循环时间由可用热量限制，通常为10到20分钟。

4. 对于丙烷脱氢，由于需要更高的平均温度，因此四阶段反应器系统更为经济。

5. 多阶段反应器系统允许初始温度低于单阶段系统的温度。

6. 截至2000年末，超过30个商业单位利用铂催化剂生产洗涤剂异构体，正在运营。

7. 随着碳原子数的增加，烷烃脱氢的平衡常数显著增加。

8. 脱氢过程必须在长期运行中保持高产率的烯烃，且无需中断。

9. 根据催化剂类型和操作参数选择合适的反应器配置。
