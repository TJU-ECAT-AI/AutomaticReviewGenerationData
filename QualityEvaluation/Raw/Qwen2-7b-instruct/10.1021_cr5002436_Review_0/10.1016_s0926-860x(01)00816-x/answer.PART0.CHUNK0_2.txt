[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes that were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."

[4] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutene."

[5] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[6] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases."

[7] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."

[8] "Oxydehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation can be considered in at least two different ways."

1. Historically, catalytic dehydrogenation for olefin production started during World War II with the practice of using a chromia-alumina catalyst to convert butanes into butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated for high-octane aviation fuel. Currently, dehydrogenation processes utilize chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts.

2. Key aspects of catalytic dehydrogenation involve approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. Processes typically use a fixed shallow bed of catalyst located inside a reactor, which might be spherical, vertical cylindrical, or horizontal, depending on the gas flow distribution and pressure drop considerations.

3. In the dehydrogenation process, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed inside a reactor. The catalyst is subjected to periodic regeneration and purge cycles to maintain its efficiency.

4. The application of chromia-alumina catalysts was later extended by Houdry for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutene, which led to the development of the Catadiene and Catofin processes.

5. In the mid-1960s, a different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was introduced for the production of long-chain linear olefins, which are useful in manufacturing biodegradable detergents.

6. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly with an increase in carbon number, indicating that heavier paraffins can be dehydrogenated at lower temperatures compared to lighter paraffins.

7. Most existing catalytic dehydrogenation processes based on platinum catalysts are based on the Oleflex process with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR). There are exceptions, such as smaller units based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum for isobutane dehydrogenation.

8. Oxydehydrogenation, while offering thermodynamic advantages, is still in its infancy compared to dehydrogenation. It involves the use of catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, and can produce ethylene in higher yields than steam cracking under certain conditions.

1. 历史上，催化脱氢用于烯烃生产的实践始于二战期间，使用氧化铝-铬催化剂将丁烷转化为丁烯，然后二聚化和氢化为高辛烷值航空燃料。目前，脱氢过程使用氧化铝-铬催化剂或更近的铂或改性铂催化剂。

2. 脱氢的关键方面涉及接近平衡或接近平衡的转化率，同时最小化副反应和焦炭形成。过程通常使用位于反应器内的固定浅床催化剂。催化剂可能为球形、垂直圆柱形或水平的，具体取决于气体流动分布和压力降考虑。

3. Houdry后来扩展应用氧化铝-铬催化剂进行丙烷脱氢为丙烯和异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯，这导致了Catadiene和Catofin过程的发展。

4. 在20世纪60年代中期，为了制造可生物降解的洗涤剂，引入了一种不同的脱氢方法来生产长链线性烯烃。

5. 随着碳数的增加，石蜡脱氢的平衡常数显著增加，表明较重的石蜡可以在比较轻的石蜡更低的温度下进行脱氢。

6. 大多数基于铂催化剂的现有脱氢过程基于具有连续催化剂再生（CCR）的Oleflex过程。存在例外，例如Phillips Petroleum开发的用于异丁烷脱氢的STAR技术的小型单元。

7. 氧化脱氢虽然在热力学上具有优势，但仍然处于起步阶段与脱氢相比。它使用含钒的催化剂以及更近的铂，可以在某些条件下产生高于蒸汽裂解的乙烯更高产率。
