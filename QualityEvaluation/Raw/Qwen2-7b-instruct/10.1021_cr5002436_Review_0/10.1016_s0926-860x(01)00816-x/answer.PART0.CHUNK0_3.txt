[1] "Large quantities of butadiene have become available over the past 30 years, mostly as a by-product from the thermal cracking of naphtha and other heavy hydrocarbons."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[3] "The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadiene."
[4] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutyrene."
[5] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum. Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[6] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidant-paraffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[7] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[8] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They serve as building blocks for numerous chemical products and plastics. Propylene is used in the production of polypropylene, a material widely employed in packaging, textiles, and automotive industries. Ethylene, similarly, is a key raw material in the manufacturing of polyethylene, which is utilized in plastic containers, films, and fibers.

The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly concerning temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins is an endothermic process, meaning it requires heat input to reach equilibrium. This is why higher temperatures are used for the production of light olefins. However, this also accelerates side reactions like coke formation and catalyst deactivation, necessitating careful control of reaction conditions.

Catalysts play a critical role in light olefin production. Chromia-alumina catalysts are effective for butadiene production, while noble metal catalysts, especially platinum, are used for the production of propylene and ethylene. Platinum catalysts allow for higher selectivity and yield, but they require continuous catalyst regeneration to maintain efficiency.

Carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene is an emerging area of research aimed at reducing environmental impacts. This approach can improve selectivity by avoiding the formation of unwanted byproducts.

The dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins requires careful management of conversion levels to ensure high selectivity. Increasing conversion towards equilibrium limits the selectivity to olefins, necessitating kinetic control of side reactions like cracking and oligomerization.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中至关重要。它们是许多化学品和塑料的构建模块。丙烯广泛用于包装、纺织品和汽车工业中的聚丙烯生产。乙烯同样在聚乙烯的制造中被广泛应用，聚乙烯用于塑料容器、薄膜和纤维的生产。

轻烯烃的合成面临着热力学挑战，尤其是温度、压力和烷烃链长的影响。烷烃脱氢为烯烃是一个吸热过程，需要输入热量以达到平衡。这就是为什么生产轻烯烃需要使用较高温度的原因。然而，这也会加速副反应如焦炭形成和催化剂失活，需要仔细控制反应条件。

催化剂在轻烯烃生产中起着关键作用。氧化铝铬催化剂适用于丁二烯的生产，而贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，用于生产丙烯和乙烯。铂催化剂可以提供更高的选择性和产率，但需要连续的催化剂再生以维持效率。

二氧化碳作为乙烷转化为乙烯的氧化剂是一种新兴的研究领域，旨在减少环境影响。这种方法可以通过避免形成不想要的副产品来提高选择性。

轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃需要精心管理转化水平，以确保高选择性。增加向平衡的转化会限制烯烃的选择性，需要对裂解和多聚化等副反应进行动力学控制。
