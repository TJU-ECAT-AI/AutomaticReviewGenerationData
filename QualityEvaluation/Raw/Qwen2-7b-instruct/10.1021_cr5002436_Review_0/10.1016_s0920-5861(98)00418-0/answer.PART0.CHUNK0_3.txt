Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their versatile applications and market trends. Propylene, for instance, is used extensively in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products, including acrylonitrile, which is a petrochemical intermediate. The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is a six-electron redox process that requires catalysts capable of activating propylene through the abstraction of an α-hydrogen, followed by ammonia insertion, subsequent rearrangements of the chemisorbed activated surface species, and desorption of acrylonitrile from the catalyst surface. The catalysts are continuously regenerated in situ by gaseous oxygen present in the feed gas mixture.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们在应用和市场趋势方面的多用途。例如，丙烯广泛用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品，包括丙烯腈，这是一种石油化学中间体。丙烯的氨氧化是六电子还原过程，需要催化剂激活丙烯并通过α-氢原子提取，随后通过氨插入，随后对表面物种进行后续重排，并从催化剂表面脱除丙烯腈。这些催化剂通过存在于进气混合物中的气体氧气原位再生。
