2.1.1 Multicomponent complex mixed metal molybdates Over the past 20 years several generations of multi-component molybdates have been developed, and the compositions are becoming ever more sophisticated and complex, giving ever better yields of the desired acrylonitrile product. The last three catalyst genera- tions, summarized according to their empirical for- mulae, are presented in Table 1.

The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile, which commands the foremost commercial position among all ammoxidation processes, produces over 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile annually. This process is a six-electron redox reaction involving the activation of propylene through the abstraction of an a-hydrogen, followed by NH-insertion, rearrangements of the chemisorbed activated surface species with additional hydrogen abstraction, and culminating in the desorption of the so formed acrylonitrile from the catalyst surface. The catalyst which is reduced in this process is continuously regenerated in situ by gaseous oxygen present in the air of the feed gas mixture. The most commonly used catalysts for this reaction are either those based on mixed metal molybdates or mixed metal antimonates.

丙烯氨氧化到丙烯腈的过程在所有氨氧化过程中占据首要的商业地位，每年生产超过10亿磅的丙烯腈。这是一个六电子还原过程，涉及到通过抽取一个a-氢原子激活丙烯，随后是NH插入、表面物种的重组排列、额外氢原子的抽取以及最终从催化剂表面释放形成的丙烯腈。在这一过程中被还原的催化剂通过空气中的氧气原位再生。目前最常用的催化剂是基于复杂混合金属钼酸盐或混合金属锑酸盐的。
