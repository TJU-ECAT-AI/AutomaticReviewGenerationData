1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products. Their market trends often reflect advancements in polymer technology and demand in various industries. The synthesis of these olefins faces thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Higher temperatures and pressures typically increase the rate of synthesis, but they may also lead to side reactions and byproduct formation, affecting product purity and yield.

2. The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is a highly commercial process, with significant contributions to the global chemical industry. The process requires specialized catalysts capable of activating propylene and ammonia efficiently under specific conditions. Key challenges include maintaining the right balance between temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition to optimize acrylonitrile yield while minimizing byproducts and cracking reactions.

3. Over the past two decades, the development of multi-component molybdates has led to more sophisticated and complex compositions, enhancing the yield of desired products like acrylonitrile. Stabilizing the Fe2 state structurally is essential for achieving high yields in oxidation and ammoxidation processes. This involves utilizing divalent elements like Ni, Co, Mg, and Mn to provide host structures for Fe2 and Fe3, facilitating redox couples and lattice oxygen transfer.

4. Achieving high acrylonitrile yields in oxidation and ammoxidation processes requires the presence of two functionally distinct phases in catalysts. These phases must cooperate effectively, being in close proximity to each other to ensure optimal catalytic activity. Future trends in this field aim to discover catalysts capable of activating ammonia at lower temperatures, enabling lower temperature operations and potentially higher yields with fewer byproducts. Additionally, exploring single-phase catalysts with optimized spatial arrangements for distinct catalytic functions could lead to further improvements. There is also potential for refining catalyst textures to achieve higher desired product yields and more environmentally favorable product mixes.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色，它们广泛应用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品。这些烯烃的市场趋势往往反映了聚合物技术的进步和各行业的需求。烯烃的合成面临温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的热力学挑战。较高的温度和压力通常会增加合成速率，但可能会导致副反应和产物形成，影响产品质量和产率。

2. 丙烯氨氧化成丙烯腈的过程是一个高度商业化的过程，对全球化学工业做出了重大贡献。该过程需要专门的催化剂，能够有效地激活丙烯和氨，在特定条件下进行高效氧化。关键挑战包括在维持适当的温度、压力和催化剂组成之间取得平衡，以优化丙烯腈的产率，同时尽量减少副反应和裂解反应。

3. 在过去的二十年里，多组分钼酸盐的发展导致了更加复杂和精细的组成，提高了所需产品的产率，例如丙烯腈。稳定Fe2状态结构对于实现氧化和氨氧化过程中的高产率至关重要。这涉及利用Ni、Co、Mg和Mn等二价元素提供Fe2和Fe3的载体结构，促进还原耦合和氧络合。

4. 实现氧化和氨氧化过程中的高丙烯腈产率需要催化剂中两个功能上不同的相的存在。这些相必须有效合作，彼此保持接近，以确保最佳催化活性。未来趋势在于发现能够降低氨激活温度的催化剂，从而实现较低温度操作，并可能获得更高的产率和较少的副产品。此外，探索单相催化剂，其具有优化的空间排列来容纳不同催化功能，可以带来进一步改进。还有潜力通过调整催化剂纹理来实现更高的目标产率和更环境友好的产物混合。
