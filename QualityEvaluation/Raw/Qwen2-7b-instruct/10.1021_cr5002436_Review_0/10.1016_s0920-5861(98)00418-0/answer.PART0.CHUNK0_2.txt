1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their wide applications and market trends. Propylene, for instance, is a versatile petrochemical intermediate used in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products. Ethylene is similarly essential in the production of polyethylene plastics, adhesives, and many other polymers. Their synthesis often involves thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects. Higher temperatures and pressures can facilitate the formation of olefins, but they may also lead to cracking reactions, producing unwanted byproducts and waste forming COx processes. Optimizing these conditions requires careful control to maximize the desired olefin yield while minimizing byproduct formation.

2. In the context of the ammoxidation of olefins, particularly propylene, to acrylonitrile, significant advancements have been made over the past two decades. Various generations of catalysts have been developed, featuring complex multicomponent mixed metal molybdates and antimonates. These catalysts enable efficient activation of olefins through the abstraction of an a-hydrogen, followed by insertion of ammonia and subsequent rearrangements leading to the formation of acrylonitrile. The composition of these catalysts is finely tuned to optimize the yield of acrylonitrile, with each element contributing specific functions, such as propylene activation, ammonia insertion, and lattice oxygen transfer.

3. To further improve the efficiency of ammoxidation processes, researchers aim to discover catalysts capable of activating ammonia at lower temperatures. This would allow for lower temperature operations, potentially increasing acrylonitrile yields and reducing the formation of byproducts. Another promising avenue involves developing single-phase catalysts that can simultaneously fulfill the distinct catalytic functions required for the ammoxidation process, ensuring optimal spatial arrangement of these functionalities. Additionally, refining the texture of these complex catalysts and exploring alternative approaches could lead to higher product yields and more environmentally friendly production methods.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中起着至关重要的作用，因为它们在应用和市场趋势方面具有广泛的作用。例如，丙烯被用作生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和其他专用产品的多用途石油化学品。乙烯同样在聚乙烯塑料、粘合剂等众多聚合物的生产中至关重要。其合成往往涉及与温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的热力学挑战。提高温度和压力有助于形成烯烃，但同时也可能导致裂解反应，产生不希望的副产品和COx废物。通过精确控制这些条件来最大化所需烯烃产量并最小化副产物形成需要仔细管理。

2. 在丙烯氨氧化为丙烯腈的过程中，过去二十年取得了显著进展。各种复杂的多组分混合金属钼酸盐和锑酸盐催化剂得到了开发。这些催化剂能够高效地激活烯烃，通过摘取a氢原子，然后插入氨分子，并进行后续重组，最终形成丙烯腈前体。这些催化剂的组成被精心调整以优化丙烯腈的产量，每种元素都执行特定的功能，如烯烃激活、氨插入以及晶格氧转移。

3. 为了进一步提高氧化过程的效率，研究人员致力于发现能够在较低温度下激活氨的催化剂。这将允许低温操作，可能增加丙烯腈产量并减少由裂解反应和形成COx废物导致的副产品。另一个有前景的方向是开发同时满足氨氧化过程中所需的不同催化功能的单相催化剂，确保这些功能的最佳空间排列。此外，对这些复杂催化剂的纹理进行改进和探索其他方法，可能会导致更高的产品产量和更环保的生产方式。
