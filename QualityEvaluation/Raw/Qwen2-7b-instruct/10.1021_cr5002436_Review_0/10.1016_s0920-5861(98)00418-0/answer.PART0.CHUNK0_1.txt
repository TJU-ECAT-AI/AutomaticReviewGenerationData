2.1.1 Multicomponent complex mixed metal molybdates Over the past 20 years several generations of multi-component molybdates have been developed, and the compositions are becoming ever more sophisticated and complex, giving ever better yields of the desired acrylonitrile product. The last three catalyst generations, summarized according to their empirical formulae, are presented in Table 1.
These compositions have been finely tuned for maximum acrylonitrile yield production in fluid bed reactors, the reactors of choice in commerce, and each element contained within these compositions has its designated function and performs accordingly.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute significantly to the chemical industry due to their versatile applications and market trends. They are used extensively in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products. The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is a highly commercial process, with over 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile being produced annually. The thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis are mainly related to achieving high yields and minimizing byproducts, which can occur due to cracking reactions and waste formation from COx processes. Optimizing temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length conditions are crucial factors in overcoming these challenges.
