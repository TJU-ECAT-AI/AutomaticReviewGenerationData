[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[4] "In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown."
[5] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[6] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East."
[7] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[8] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[9] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[10] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[11] "Dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[12] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[13] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[14] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[15] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[16] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[17] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol−1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol−1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol−1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

The chemical industry heavily relies on light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, for producing a variety of essential chemicals. The demand for these olefins has consistently grown over the years, except in the Eurozone due to economic downturns. Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) are the primary methods for olefin production. Natural gas supply increases have driven down costs, making shale gas a cost-effective resource for both energy and chemical production. The market for light olefins is influenced by factors like market demand, supply disruptions, and price differences between raw materials and final products. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a profitable process, especially when the price gap between propane and propylene is significant. Dehydrogenation yields a pure olefin product, unlike other processes that produce mixtures. Current trends indicate a surge in PDH installations worldwide due to growing demand and supply constraints. The profitability of PDH is closely tied to the price dynamics of its feedstocks and products. Investments in butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in various countries reflect the response to market shifts, such as increased butadiene prices. The thermodynamic challenges in dehydrogenation processes, including the endothermic nature of the reactions and the complexity of side reactions, necessitate careful control of temperature and pressure to optimize olefin yields and minimize unwanted transformations.

化学工业高度依赖轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，用于生产各种关键化学品。这些烯烃的需求在过去几年中持续增长，除了欧元区，由于经济衰退的影响。蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）是主要的轻烯烃生产方法。天然气供应的增加已导致成本降低，使页岩气成为能源和化工生产成本效益高的资源。轻烯烃市场受市场需求、供应中断以及原材料与最终产品价格差异等因素影响。丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一个有利可图的过程，尤其是当丙烷和丙烯的价格差距较大时。脱氢过程产生纯净的烯烃产品，而不是混合物。当前趋势显示全球范围内PDH装置数量激增，这反映了对需求增长和供应限制的响应。PDH的盈利能力紧密联系着其原料和产品的价格动态。在不同国家对但烯脱氢（BDH）装置的投资反映出了市场变化，如丁二烯价格上涨的情况。脱氢过程的热力学挑战，包括反应的吸热性质和副反应的复杂性，需要精心控制温度和压力以优化烯烃产率并最小化不必要的转化。
