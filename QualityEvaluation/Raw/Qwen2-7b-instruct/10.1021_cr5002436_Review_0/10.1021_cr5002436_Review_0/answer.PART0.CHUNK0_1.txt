[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[3] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "In fact, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[6] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[7] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East."
[8] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[9] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[10] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[11] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[12] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[13] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[14] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

1. Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, serving as essential building blocks for producing a wide range of chemicals, polymers, oxygenates, and intermediates. Their demand has consistently grown, except in the Eurozone due to economic downturns, reflecting their pivotal role in modern chemical manufacturing. Key production methods involve steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of various oil byproducts. Recent advancements in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) have led to a significant drop in natural gas costs, making shale gas an attractive feedstock for chemical production, particularly in the US, which has become the world's leading low-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East.

2. The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, primarily requiring high temperatures and pressures for optimal conversions. The reaction is highly endothermic, necessitating elevated conditions to achieve significant olefin yields. The energy required for dehydrogenation increases with the chain length of the alkane, and pressure plays a critical role in determining olefin yields. Strategies to mitigate these challenges include lowering paraffin partial pressure through pressure reduction or steam dilution, removing hydrogen through selective hydrogen combustion, or utilizing solid oxygen carriers. Another approach is employing hydrogen-permeable membranes to shift the reaction equilibrium towards higher olefin yields.

3. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene. This dynamic creates favorable market conditions, driving investments in new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) installations globally. Butane dehydrogenation (BDH) has also received increased attention due to similar market dynamics, with investments in new BDH facilities in the US, China, and Japan.

4. Dehydrogenation technologies offer distinct advantages over traditional synthesis methods, as they yield pure olefins without producing a mixture of products. This specificity allows for the optimization of catalysts to enhance olefin selectivity and efficiency, contributing to the overall improvement of the dehydrogenation process.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯（丙烯）和乙烯（乙烷），是化学工业中最重要的化合物类型之一，在生产各种化学品、聚合物、氧化物和中间体方面起着关键作用。它们的需求量一直稳步增长，除了欧元区，由于经济衰退的影响，市场情况有所不同。主要生产方法包括蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）等油类产品。近年来，水力压裂技术的进步使得大规模以成本效益的方式提取天然气成为可能。这导致天然气价格大幅下降，使页岩气成为化学生产极具吸引力的能源来源和原料，尤其是在美国，它已经成为全球领先的低成本化学生产商，仅次于中东。

2. 合成轻烯烃面临着热力学挑战，需要高温和高压以实现最佳转化。反应具有高度吸热性，需要提高条件以获得大量烯烃。随着烷基链长度的增加，脱氢所需能量会增加，压力在确定烯烃产率方面发挥着关键作用。缓解这些挑战的策略包括通过压力降低或蒸汽稀释降低烷烃分压、通过选择性氢燃烧移除氢气、或使用固体氧载体。另一种方法是利用氢渗透膜来改变反应平衡，从而提高烯烃产率。

3. 环丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异。这种动态创造了有利的市场条件，推动了全球新的丙烷脱氢（PDH）安装的投资。丁烷脱氢（BDH）也因相似的市场动态而受到关注，中国、美国和日本等国家投资建设新的BDH设施。

4. 脱氢技术提供了与传统合成方法相比的独特优势，因为它们能够产生纯烯烃而不产生混合产品。这种特异性允许优化催化剂以提高烯烃选择性和效率，从而促进脱氢过程的整体改进。
