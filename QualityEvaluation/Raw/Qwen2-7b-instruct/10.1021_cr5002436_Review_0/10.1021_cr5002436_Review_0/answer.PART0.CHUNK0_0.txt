[1] "Light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[3] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States."
[6] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[7] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[8] "In fact, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene."
[9] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[10] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East."
[11] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States."
[12] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[13] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[14] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[15] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive use as building blocks for producing polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates. They are primarily obtained through steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of oil byproducts. With the rise in shale gas extraction, there has been a significant reduction in gas costs, making it an attractive source for both energy and chemical production. This shift has led to a decrease in the use of naphtha for steam cracking and a shift towards using ethane derived from shale gas. The profitability of dehydrogenation processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, is heavily influenced by the price differences between the feedstock and the desired product. This has resulted in a surge of investment in dehydrogenation technologies, especially for butane dehydrogenation, driven by increased demand and price fluctuations in butadiene.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是化学工业中最重要的化合物之一，因为它们广泛用作聚合物、氧化剂和重要中间体的构建块。它们主要通过蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）从油副产品获得。随着页岩气开采量的增加，天然气成本显著降低，使其成为能源和化学品生产有吸引力的来源。这一转变导致了对使用页岩气衍生乙烷的蒸汽裂解的使用减少，并转向使用乙烷。脱氢过程的盈利能力，如丙烷脱氢，很大程度上取决于原料与目标产品的价格差异。这导致了对脱氢技术的投资激增，尤其是针对丁烷脱氢，这是由汽车行业的增长需求和裂解成本上升导致丁二烯价格波动引发的。
