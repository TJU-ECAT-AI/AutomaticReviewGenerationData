[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[3] "In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown."
[4] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[5] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[6] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[7] "This includes light olefins, which can be obtained by first converting natural gas into synthesis gas and by subsequently converting the latter either directly through the Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins (FTO) process or indirectly through the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) route with an intermediate methanol synthesis step."
[8] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[9] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[10] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[11] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[12] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[13] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[14] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[15] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[16] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[17] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[18] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are essential components in the chemical industry due to their widespread use as building blocks. They are crucial in the production of polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. Market trends show a steady increase in demand, with the exception of the Eurozone, due to economic downturns. The primary methods for their synthesis include steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

2. The high energy demands, low selectivity, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices drive the petrochemical industry to seek more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion technologies. Shale gas extraction has led to a significant drop in gas costs, making it an attractive feedstock for producing transportation fuels and chemicals, including light olefins.

3. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is an on-purpose technique that yields exclusively olefins, making it an attractive alternative to mixed-product techniques. The profitability of this process is influenced by the price difference between the paraffin and the corresponding olefin, indicating favorable market conditions. Optimization of industrial dehydrogenation processes allows for the production of high-purity olefins suitable for polymer manufacturing.

4. The market for dehydrogenation of butanes mirrors the situation for propane, with increased demand and decreased supply leading to higher butadiene prices. This has prompted investments in new butane dehydrogenation installations in countries such as the United States, China, and Japan.

1. 丙烯和乙烯这样的轻烯烃是化学工业中的重要组成部分，因为它们被广泛用作构建块。它们对于聚合物、氧化物和化学中间体的生产至关重要。市场趋势显示，除了欧元区外，需求呈稳定增长态势，原因在于经济衰退。主要合成方法包括蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）。

2. 高能需求、低选择性、石油资源枯竭以及油价上涨促使石油化工行业寻找更经济的原料和高效的转化技术。页岩气开采导致天然气成本大幅下降，使其成为生产运输燃料和化学品（包括轻烯烃）的有吸引力的原料来源。

3. 轻烷烃脱氢是一种专一性技术，仅产生烯烃，这使得它成为替代混合产物技术的有吸引力的选择。这种过程的盈利能力受到烷烃与对应烯烃价格差异的影响，表明有利的市场条件。优化工业脱氢过程允许生产适合聚合物制造的高纯度烯烃。

4. 对丁烷脱氢的情况类似于丙烷，由于需求增加和供应减少导致丁二烯价格上涨，这促成了美国、中国和日本等国家对新的丁烷脱氢装置的投资。
