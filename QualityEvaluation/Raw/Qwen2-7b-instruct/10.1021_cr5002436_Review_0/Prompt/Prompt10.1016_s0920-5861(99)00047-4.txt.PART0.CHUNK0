Introduction The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [1]. In the 19701980s, the main interest was devoted to the catalytic dehydro- genation of n-butane to butene and butadiene, which are precursor molecules for manufacturing synthetic rubber [2]. Nowadays, however, the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important.
Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas iso- butene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline. The reknown CATO- FIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. This number is expected to increase in the future because the traditional sources of isobutene,i.e. steam cracking and FCC, are already heavily used,and the availability of isobutene has become a bottle- neck in the expansion of the MTBE market.
Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process,and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain signicant yields of alkenes [3].
Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane mole- cule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogena- tion reaction is expected to be rather unselective.
Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke.
As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.

oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well- known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice. The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver [6], and by Kearby [7]. Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts [850]. All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identication of the active sites; (b) inuence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selec- tivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism.
In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydro- genation catalysts, in particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. In Section 2, the thermodynami- cal constraints for alkane dehydrogenations and their technological consequences will be introduced. Sec- tions 3 and 4 are devoted to the synthesis and spectro- scopic characterization, while Section 5 discusses the factors governing the catalytic activity and selectivity.
In Section 6, the spectroscopic and catalytic data of Cr-based catalysts will be combined in an attempt to dene structureactivity/selectivity relationships.

Thermodynamical constraints for alkane dehydrogenations and their technological consequences Dehydrogenation reactions, CnH2n2$CnH2nH2,are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamical equilibrium [51]. The- oretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydroge- nated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures. This is illustrated in Table 1 for several linear and branched alkanes [3]. The table summarizes the reaction tem- peratures at which a certain conversion of the alkane towards the corresponding alkene can be obtained. For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively. In addition, trans-2-butene for- mation requires about the same temperature as 1- butene formation, whereas cis-2-butene is formed only at higher temperatures. Conversions can also be increased by using lower pressures or by using dilu- ents with the alkane feed.
Dehydrogenation reactions are rather unselective,because all equivalent CH bonds have an equal bonding energy, and therefore an equal chance of reacting [3]. When two CH bonds of neighbouring carbons are split, a double bond is formed and alkanes are converted to alkenes. However, when the two CH bonds belong to non-neighboring carbon atoms, dehy- drocyclization and possibly also aromatization may occur. The latter reaction is especially pronounced for alkanes with carbon chains of at least six carbons.
Thermodynamics show that aromatization equilibria overtake dehydrogenation equilibria at higher tem- peratures. Thus, n-hexane is primarily converted to benzene, whereas toluene can be made from n-hep- tane. If the two CH bonds are part of two different alkane molecules, higher molecular-weight hydrocar- bons are formed, and extensive CH bond breaking and CC bond formation may lead to hydrogen gas and coke. Thus, to achieve an acceptable activity and selectivity per pass, the catalyst needs to be periodi- cally regenerated by burning the coke deposited on the surface. It is also clear that degradation reactions Table 1 Dehydrogenation equilibria for several linear and branched alkanes: the reported numbers are the temperatures (8C) required for the given conversions at a total pressure of one atmosphere (after [3]) Conversion (mol%) Ethene Propene 1-Butene cis-2-Butene trans-2-Butene Isobutene 1-Pentene 1-Hexene 10 555 456 460 470 450 405 450 450 30 660 540 545 555 540 490 535 535 50 725 595 600 625 598 540 585 585 70 790 660 670 700 640 590 650 650 90 900 750 753 800 760 680 730 730 224

result in more hydrogen being produced than alkene,and that a proper choice of feed rate and temperature are needed to achieve an optimum industrial dehy- drogenation process that has the required selectivity.
Since the discovery of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have done extensive research to develop a commercial dehydrogenation process. The main tech- nological problems, within the constraint to operate as a continuous process; are (1) sufcient heat supply to the reactor; (2) careful temperature control to mini- mize degradation products and to maximize conver- sion and (3) catalyst regeneration. Different solutions have been developed, depending on the know-how of the various companies. The best known processes are the CATOFIN1 (for alkenes), the CATADIENE1 (for dienes), the LINDEBASF1 the UOP1 and the SNAMPROGETTI-YARSINTEZ1 processes. How- ever, it is important to stress here that the LINDE1 process has only been used on a demonstration plant,and has never been really commercialized.
In all these industrial processes, the heat obtained from the burning of coke is used in the dehydrogena- tion step. In the worldwide CATOFIN1 process,licensed by UCI-ABB Lummus Global, series of adiabatic xed bed reactors are in cyclic operation with quickly alternating dehydrogenating and regen- eration periods. In contrast, the uidized bed SNAM- PROGETTI-YARSINTEZ1 process uses a uidized bed reactor, and a regenerator interconnected with each other. The latter process is mainly used in Russia,and the industrial plants are of relatively small capa- city. Details of these processes and reactor designs can be found in several interesting papers [5255].

Catalyst synthesis Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirco- nia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been stu- died in great detail [7]. Alumina possess the undesired feature of catalyzing degradation reactions, i.e. crack- ing and coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%. In this respect, zirconia has some advantages over alumina,because of its high thermal stability and low surface acidity. Indeed, De Rossi et al. [44,45] have found even higher dehydrogenation activities for Cr/ZrO2 catalysts.
The initial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst of Frey and Huppke was prepared by coprecipitation of aluminium and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but numerous modied preparation proce- dures have since been developed [6,7]. Many of these preparation methods, mostly differing in their Cr content and type of alkali metal ion, have appeared in the patent literature. Generally speaking, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can be prepared by three techniques:
1. Impregnation procedures in which a chromium
salt is deposited on an alumina support from a suitable solvent and then decomposed to the chromium oxides. Most frequently, supported chromium oxide catalysts are prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation of a porous high- surface area alumina with an aqueous solution containing chromium (VI) trioxide or chromium (III) nitrate. If an alkali ion, such as potassium, is needed, an aqueous solution containing K2CrO4 is used.
2. Coprecipitation procedures in which chromium
and aluminium species are more or less simulta- neously precipitated, dried, and calcined.
3. Atomic layer epitaxy procedures in which a chro-
mium salt, such as Cr(acac)3, reacts with the alumina surface from the vapor phase. This alter- native preparation method was recently reported by Kytokivi et al. [43].

Catalyst characterization Numerous papers have been published in the lit- erature regarding the characterization of chromium oxides supported on different inorganic oxides, and much research has dealt with the use of a specic spectroscopic technique, such as electron spin reso-

([4143,49]),diffuse reectance spectroscopy (DRS) [13,14,24,25,35,36], infrared spectroscopy (IR) [38,44], and Raman spectroscopy (RS) [1623,3133]. An overview of this eld, and the potential and limitation of each characterization tech- nique has been recently given in another review paper (1). As a consequence, we will limit our discussion here to a detailed discussion of the structure of (a) freshly prepared, (b) catalytically active, and (c) deactivated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.
4.1.
Freshly prepared catalysts The surface composition of calcined Cr/Al2O3 cat- alysts as a function of the Cr oxide loading is sum- marized in Table 2. The table shows three distinct Cr loading regions, their exact limits are a function of the preparation method, coupled with the surface area of the alumina support. It is important to notice that the reported surface composition in Table 2 refers to fully dehydrated catalysts.
At low Cr oxide loadings, typically lower than 1 wt%, only Cr6 and Cr5 are detected. However, XPS only detects Cr6, whereas DRS and RS are able to discriminate between chromate and polychro- mate (dichromate, trichromate, etc.) [1]. However, at these low loadings, monochromate is the dominant species [24]. This species strongly interacts with the alumina support via its most basic hydroxyl groups,and cannot be removed by rinsing the catalyst with cold water [39]. In addition to Cr6, some Cr5 is detected by EPR. This Cr5 is in square pyramidal coordination, and represents only a small fraction of the surface, typically less than 3% of the total Cr content [30].
At intermediate Cr oxide loadings,typically between 1 wt% and monolayer coverage loading, both Cr6/5 and Cr3 are detected, and the amount of Cr6/5 decreases as a percentage of the total Cr content with increasing Cr oxide loading. In addition,the polychromate:chromate ratio increases with increasing Cr loading, indicating that less (reactive) hydroxyl groups are available to stabilize the surface chromium oxide as an anchored chromate species [29]. This results in weakly bonded polychromate species, which are (more) easily removed via rinsing with cold water [39]. Besides Cr6/5, Cr3 is also detected by XPS, DRS and EPR [1]. These Cr3- species are present as isolated surface species (d-signal in EPR) and/or amorphous oxide clusters (b-signal in EPR) of small sizes, which are XRD- invisible.
At much higher Cr oxide loadings, i.e. above mono- layer coverage loading, Cr3 is the dominant species,and the fraction of Cr6 is rather low. Two types of Cr3 are observed isolated and clustered Cr3. The latter can be present as either crystalline a-Cr2O3,which is XRD-detectable, and amorphous Cr2O3. The remaining fraction of Cr6 is typically around 2 wt%,as shown in Table 3. It is also important to mention here that different research groups have experimen- tally determined a monolayer coverage of about 4 Cr/ nm2. This corresponds, depending on the surface area of the alumina support, with 68 wt%. Although Vuur- man et al. [20] report that up to a monolayer almost all the chromium oxide species are stabilized as Cr6,other research groups have observed both Cr3 and Cr6 at monolayer coverage. For example, Kozlowski [50] reports that only 60% of Cr is stabilized as Cr6 at monolayer coverage. These discrepancies in literature must be attributed to differences in preparation and Table 2 Surface composition of calcined Cr/Al2O3 catalysts as a function of Cr oxide loading as determined by several characterization techniques Cr oxide loading (wt% Cr)

pretreatment conditions. The initial calcination tem- perature seems in this respect very important because of the low thermal stability of anchored polychromate species, which are readily convertable to Cr3. Sum- marizing, different surface species are observed on the surface of freshly prepared catalysts, their relative concentration mainly depending on the overall Cr loading, the alumina surface area, and the calcination treatment.
4.2.
Active catalysts Up to now, most reported characterization studies were done under conditions often far away from real catalytic conditions. This is mainly due to the fact that in situ capabilities have only recently become com- mercially available. As a consequence, only a limited number of in situ characterization studies are available in the literature. The most promising techniques in this respect are Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reec- tance spectroscopy in the UVVis region, both tech- niques are suitable to monitor surface Cr-species during alkane dehydrogenations [32,33,36,37,57 59]. In situ Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the reduction process of surface Cr6 species on a 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of n-butane.
It was concluded that polychromate was more readily reducible than monochromate [32]. However, above 3508C the in situ Raman spectra became less infor- mative due to coke formation. In situ DRS spectro- scopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3 [5759]. Thus, sur- face Cr3 species are formed under reaction condi- tions at the expense of Cr6. The in situ DRS cell was coupled with a GC in order to monitor on line the activity and selectivity of the catalysts under study. It was found that there is a  more or less  quantitative relationship between the amount of pseudo-octahedral Cr3 formed by reduction and the dehydrogenation activity [58,59]. The nature of these surface Cr3 species was further unraveled by infrared spectro- scopy measurements of adsorbed probe molecules (CO/NO). De Rossi et al. [45] concluded that isolated Cr3 sites with two coordinative vacancies are formed on 0.161.55 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of n-propane. In conclusion, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts con- tain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species under reaction conditions.
4.3.
Deactivated catalysts The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physicochemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation. First of all, the specic sur- face area of the catalyst decreases with increasing time-on-stream, increasing reaction temperature and increasing number of catalytic cycles [42]. In addition,the amount of surface Cr6 decreased with increasing number of cycles. Hakuli et al. [42] observed that in a fresh 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst 15% of the Cr was present as Cr6, whereas after 25 cycles, the amount of Cr6 as a percentage of the total Cr content was only
12.7. Thus, part of the Cr6 was irreversibly reduced
to a lower oxidation state. The same authors also found an almost linear relationship between the initial dehy- drogenation activity and the amount of Cr6 as deter- mined by XPS in the spent catalyst [42].
Similar results were obtained by De Rossi et al.
[45]. These authors observed that the extent of reduc- tion (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with increasing number of reductiondehydrogenation recalcination cycles. This decrease has been attributed to an incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species.
