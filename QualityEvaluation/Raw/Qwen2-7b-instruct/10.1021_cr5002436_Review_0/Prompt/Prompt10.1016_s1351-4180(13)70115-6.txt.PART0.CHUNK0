I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

2012. Ventech Engineers International
LLC has now completed the plant design and provided a fixed price quote for the modules. Calumet has confirmed that the project economics look strong. At the same time, Calumets appointed third-party owners engineer finished a thorough review of the Oxford Catalysts technology, as well as Ventechs GTL design and other intended technology components. Calumet has described the technology as fantastic. Calumet now plans to progress with the more detailed engineering and market analysis for a plant of approximately 1400 barrel/d. At the conclusion of this study, which is expected to last 6 months, Calumet will be in a position to decide on proceeding with fabrication. Roy Lipski (CEO of Oxford Catalysts Group) said that this is an exciting development for Oxford Catalysts. The project with Calumet will be the only commercial GTL plant in N America to move in to front end engineering, other than Sasols project in Louisiana. If it continues on its current schedule, it will be the first GTL plant to be operational in N America, and the only commercial smaller scale GTL anywhere in the world.

The agreement includes further development of Solazymes high myristic algal oil, a valuable raw material in the oleochemical industry, as well as additional oils that Solazyme is developing for the oleochemical and industrial sectors. Product development is expected to span a multi-year period, with periodic product introductions throughout the term of the joint development alliance.
End use applications may include renewable, high-performance polymer additives for plastic applications,aviation lubricants, and toiletry and household products. According to a Mitsui official, Mitsui is strengthening its position in the oleochemicals industry through development and commercialization of novel products as a potential source of new sustainable materials to oleochemical companies including Mitsuis subsidiary, Palm-Oleo Sdn Bhd.

This process will be used to convert refinery-derived iso-butane to iso-butylene, a valuable petrochemical used in the production of fuels and synthetic rubber. This is UOPs second C Oleflex process license in China. In addition to technology licensing, UOP will provide basic engineering, catalysts, adsorbents,specialty equipment, and engineering for the project. Longgang Chemical Co will use the UOP technology to process 175,000 tonne/y of mixed butane feedstock at its plant in Dongying City, Shandong Province, China. The plant is expected to start- up in 2015. The C Oleflex process uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert iso-butane to iso-butylene.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends, and what are the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
