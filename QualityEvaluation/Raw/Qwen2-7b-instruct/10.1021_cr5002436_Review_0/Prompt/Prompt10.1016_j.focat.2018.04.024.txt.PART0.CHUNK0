I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Totals existing polyethylene 400,000 tonnes/ y (880 M lbs) facility in Bayport, TX; and a new 625,000 tonnes/y (1.35 bn lbs) Borstar polyethylene unit at Totals Bayport, TX, site,following a decision on the outcome of an acceptable EPC contract. As announced in Mar 2017, the new $1.7 bn ethane steam cracker is being built alongside Totals Port Arthur refinery and Total/BASF existing steam cracker. The project, which is scheduled to start up in 2020, will create around 1500 jobs during peak engineering and construction activity.Total, 19 Feb 2018, (Website: http://www.total. com)  Total 2018 Brain AG buys majority stake in British enzyme producer Biocatalysts.
Biotech firm Brain AG acquired a majority stake in the British speciality enzyme manufacturer Biocatalysts. The deal is set to close in 1Q 2018. Brain said that the acquisition is profitable and generated $9.5 M in FY 2017 (FY 2016: $8.0 M).
Biocatalysts, along with a US subsidiary,specializes in the development, production and distribution of speciality enzymes for different industries like food and fine chemicals. Transparency Market Research reported that the speciality enzymes market in 2016 generated nearly $1.8 bn in sales and is anticipated to more than double by 2025 to around $3.7 bn.Chemie Aktuell, 18 Mar 2018, (Website: http:// www.maerkte-weltweit.de)  MBM Martin Brueckner Medien GmbH 2018 Eni licenses EST slurry refining technology to Zhejiang Petrochemicals.
Eni has been awarded a contract by Zhejiang Petrochemicals for the licence for the construction of two refining lines based on Eni Slurry Technology (EST). The two production lines are located on the island of Zhoushan (Zejiang Province, China), and will have a refining capacity of 3 M tonnes/y each. They will be built as part of a project for the construction of a new refinery with a capacity of 40 M tonnes/y. Start-up is planned for 2020. The agreement represents an important step to enhance the value of EST technology. Following the decision by Sinopec to adopt this technology for its Maoming refinery in China, EST can be viewed in the country as the best worldwide technological solution for operators who wish to completely convert the bottom of the barrel. The choice by Zhejiang Petrochemicals has great value from an environmental point, considering that the new EST plant replaces an originally planned petroleum coke line. The full agreement includes: licence to use the EST technology, process design package,training, technical services, proprietary equipment and the sale of the catalyst.Eni, 16 Mar 2018, (Website: http://www.eni. com/)  Eni SpA 2018 Singapore carbon tax welcomed by energy firms.
Global energy majors ExxonMobil and Shell positively accept, with some reservations,the Singaporean governments carbon tax introduction in an effort to address climate change. Starting 2019, a $5/tonne carbon tax will be imposed on all plants with 25,000 tonnes/y of greenhouse gas emissions or more. The tax will apply to all major emitters, which represent around 80% of the countrys emissions. The decision is anticipated to generate almost $1 bn in government revenue in the first five years of execution. The government plans to review the S$5/tonne rate in 2023,with intentions to increase it to S$10-15/ tonne in 2030.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
