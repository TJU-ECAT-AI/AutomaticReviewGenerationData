The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter is a promising concept for industrial applications that could not only contribute to the mitigation of CO2 levels, but also the development of economical and energy efficient syntheses of various chemicals. The abundant availability, non-toxic, economic and mild oxidizing properties of CO2 has resulted in immense interest in its use as an oxidant in several reactions, such as the oxidative coupling of CH4 and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkyl aromatics. At present, only a few processes based on CO2 as a soft oxidant have been realised on a technical scale in spite of dedicated research. This review is intended to trace the emergence, application and understanding of such systems and shed light on the further development that may lead to industrial scale operations in the near future.

Introduction Since the discovery of carbon dioxide by Joseph Black as fixed air in experiments with magnesia alba,1 CO2 has been the subject of interest in the scientific community. Over the past few decades,contemporary research has been focused on the sequestration of CO2 levels in the atmosphere due to its culpable green house effect and global warming.2 Utilization of CO2 globally is envi- sioned by scientists as a necessity that could contribute not only to the mitigation of CO2 atmospheric levels, but also towards the economic, renewable and environmentally friendly synthesis of value added products.3,4 The barrier for its utilization arises from its low reactivity, thermodynamic stability and high oxidation state.5,6 However, its utilization has been realised in a few cases,such as the synthesis of urea, formic acid,7 methanol, cyclic carbonates, lactone8 and salicylic acid.9 A recent report by Krebs et al.5 on the utilization of carbon dioxide revealed that the industrial use of CO2 per year is approximately 120 Mt, whereas total anthropogenic CO2 emissions are about 24 Gt. These statistics put forward a great challenge for scientists to design and develop new technologies for carbon dioxide utilization. It is a well known fact that present technologies for the utilization of carbon dioxide rely on the use of high energy starting materials,such as hydrogen or organometallics, or low energy synthetic targets or a shift of the equilibrium reaction by removal of products.6 Although significant advances have been made in the field of carbon dioxide, there are still inherent drawbacks, such as extensive energy consumption, the hydrogen economy and slow sorption kinetics. In view of these points, there is a requirement of an alternative technological method for the utilization of CO2.
One such technology, which is enjoying rapid growth, relates to the behavioural aspects of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalytic transformations. Initial studies on the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide in catalytic transformations date back to the 1990s and form the basis of present day soft oxidant systems.1013 The effect of carbon dioxide in the oxidative Laboratory of Nano-Green Catalysis and Nano Center for Fine Chemical Fusion Technology, Department of Chemistry, Inha University, Incheon,402-751, South Korea.

Broader context The increase in carbon dioxide levels has become a global concern for the scientific community due to its culpable greenhouse effect and global warming. Various approaches for the mitigation of CO2 levels, ranging from capture, storage, sequestration and utili- zation, have been investigated. Among them, the utilization of CO2 as a feedstock for producing chemicals is attractive as an integral part of the carbon cycle and also as a strategic part of recycling. Establishing a chemical industry based on utilization of CO2 as a feedstock is a long-term goal as well as a fascinating dream for synthetic chemists. However, its utilization as a soft oxidant and promoter could also be accomplished in current existing industrial processes. This minireview highlights some recent promising research activities and their prospects in the areas of CO2 utilization as an oxidant and promoter and traces the emergence,application and understanding of such systems to pave the way for the development of alternative technologies for industrial scale operations in the near future.

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which exhibi- ted superior conversions compared with that of a simple dehy- drogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The product analysis during the reaction revealed the occurrence of water, CO and H2 in addition to styrene; moreover the occurrence of H2 was 1/4 of the CO produced. These results implied that the reaction pro- ceeded by an oxidative pathway leading to the dissociation of CO2 molecules into CO and surface oxygen, which could abstract hydrogen to form water.
The present review paves the way for the development of alternative technologies utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter to produce chemicals. The objective of this review is to trace the emergence, application and understanding of these systems, which clearly depict the role of CO2 and an activator, as well as to discuss the catalyst properties, the role of surface oxygen species and mechanistic pathways.

Soft oxidant system The studies on the behaviour of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant were investigated by Park et al.12 in the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of ethyl benzene to styrene over three different iron-based catalysts: (a) zeolite-supported Fe3O4 (FeNaZ), (b) Fe3O4 and (c) a commercially used catalyst (bulk K-Fe2O3, Nissan Gridler G-64 JX).12 A comparison of the conversions and selectivity under CO2 and N2 streams showed the superior activity of FeNaZ and Fe3O4 in a CO2 stream whereas, in the case of the commercial catalyst, the catalytic performance was better in an N2 stream. The analysis revealed that the FeNaZ catalyst possesses a well dispersed meta-stable Fe3O4 phase with oxygen deficiencies, which can abstract oxygen from CO2 leading to the formation of CO. This dissociated oxygen on the catalyst surface is responsible for hydrogen abstraction from ethyl benzene,which, in turn, forms water.
These differences in catalytic performance shed light on the behavioural aspects of carbon dioxide and its activation, the surface properties of the catalyst, the role of supports, the importance of surface oxygen species and the distinct mecha- nistic pathways that form the basis of the evolution of the reaction, which are important in the utilization of carbon dioxide in oxidation reactions. This review will discuss these aspects and provide a summary of a few examples, such as the oxidative coupling of methane and the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes and alkyl aromatics (Scheme 1).
2.1
Use of CO2 as a soft oxidant The utilization of CO2 as a feedstock is a promising long term objective, which could have a small but significant positive impact on the global carbon balance. However, it could be made more advantageous by the utilization of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in catalytic transformations. Bartholomew14 reported the oxidizing ability of various gases in the gasification of coke.
The reactivity order was found to be: O2 (105) > H2O (3) > CO2 (1) > H2 (0.003), which suggests that CO2 is less reactive than molecular oxygen and water molecules but shows a considerable Scheme 1 Carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant in oxidative coupling and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Apart from its oxidizing ability, CO2 has the highest heat capacity among other typical gases; moreover, it can minimize the hot spot phenomenon,15,16 which can cause prob- lems with regards to the operation of the reactor, such as temperature runaway, catalyst deactivation, undesired side reactions and the undesirable oxidation of products.17 Carbon dioxide as a diluent in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reac- tions not only serves as an oxidant but also shows several beneficial properties in comparison with other oxidants.
Other oxidizing agents that have been investigated in ODH are O2, N2O and SO2.18 The use of O2 leads to the burning of significant quantities of valuable hydrocarbons and generates unwanted carbon oxides due to the strong oxidizing power of oxygen.19 Shiju et al. have used N2O as a mild oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene and shown its superior performance.20 The drawback associated to the use of N2O is its major safety hazards, like the risk of asphyxiation, its action as a dissociative anaesthetic and, moreover, the decrease in mental performance, audiovisual ability and manual dexterity reported after short-term exposure.21 Sulfur dioxide has also been used as an oxidizing agent;22 however, its use is not attractive because of the formation of toxic and corrosive by- products, like CS2, COS and benzothiophene. Based on these observations it is an inevitable fact that the best oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation is carbon dioxide.
CO2 in soft oxidant systems plays a prominent role in hydrogen abstraction from simple or functionalized hydrocar- bons via the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.19 Apart from the abstraction of H atoms and providing surface oxygen, the significance of CO2 in the reaction shows several other beneficial features, such as acceler- ation of the reaction rate by changing the dehydrogenation pathway in an oxidative manner23 and enhancing the selec- tivity.24 CO2 also alleviates the chemical equilibrium in ODH by the effective removal of H2 through coupling with a reverse water gas shift reaction (eqn (1)).11,25
H2 + CO2 / CO + H2O
(1) Calculation on the basis of the SoaveRedlichKwong (SRK) equation of state at different feed compositions, temperatures and pressures, which affect the ethyl benzene equilibrium conversion in ODH, were studied by Sun et al.25 and confirmed the removal of H2 can overcome the equilibrium limitation and enhance catalytic performance.
The
CO2
suppresses the unwanted total oxidation products due to its lower oxidizing ability26 and may also improve selectivity by poisoning the nonselective sites of the catalysts, which mainly contribute to the byproducts.27 Moreover, it will also alleviate coking via a decoking reaction (eqn (2)).
C + CO2 / 2CO
(2) The activity may be stable when coking and decoking reach equilibrium; this was proved by the activation of the deactivated catalyst with CO2. 25 The ethyl benzene (EB) conversion on the Fe/Li-activated carbon catalyst showed a decrease in activity to 10% after 65 h at 823 K. However, this deactivated catalyst, when treated in pure CO2 without EB at the reaction temperature for 4 h, produced CO. After decoking, the catalyst activity was resumed to some extent with an EB conversion of about 23%.
Saito et al.28 have investigated the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) over V, Cr and Fe on different supports [MgO, O-Dia (oxidized diamond), Al2O3 and activated carbon (AC)] to confirm the contribution of the RWGS reaction. The reaction of H2 and CO2 was carried out at 823 K. Fig. 1 shows the hydrogen conversion in the RWGS reaction with V, Cr and Fe on different supports. Overall, the formation of CO and H2O were observed in approximately a 1 : 1 molar ratio. These catalysts were also investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene (Table 1) with CO2, which suggested the occurrence of a RGWS reaction in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
The effect of carbon dioxide in the different catalytic reactions can be generalized as a gas-mediated modification of the catalyst surface and/or bulk composition, which affect the structural,electronic, acidbase, adsorption, diffusion and redox proper- ties.29 These modifications can lead to changes in the reaction mechanism, as well changes in the catalytic activity and product selectivity.19,29 These unique features of CO2 allow it to be coined as a soft oxidant.30 Currently, the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been extended to the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene3134 and the ODH of various alkanes, alkyl aromatics and hydrocarbons,10,26,30,3537 and there is still a lot of scope for its use in other reactions.

CO2 electronic structure and activation CO2 in its electronic ground state is a closed shell linear system with 1Sg + symmetry. The electronic structure of CO2 may be represented by a Walsh diagram (Fig. 2).38,39 The left hand side reflects the orbitals symmetry properties whereas, on the right-hand side, schematic drawings of the molecular orbitals are depicted. The highest occupied molecular orbital is the lpgx orbital; the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is the 2pu orbital. The activation and cleavage of CO2 can be judged by the stability of the linear geometry in a qualitative way and the energy positions of the occupied and unoccupied Fig. 1 Reverse water gas shift reaction over V, Cr and Fe on various supports.28 Reprinted with permission from ref 28.

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online orbitals upon bending the linear geometry.38 The s orbital energies from the linear to the bent configuration show little or no increase in energy. The p orbital energies show a pronounced effect and the degeneracy is split into two components. In the case of 1pu and 1pg, the splitting is not very large. The 2pu orbital degeneracy splits into two components, 2bl and 6al. The 2b1 (in plane) energy is almost unchanged upon bending, whereas for the 6al component (out of plane), the energy falls sharply in favour of the bent molecule. The 2pu-6a1 molecular orbital is important in determining the bond angle, since this is the only valence orbital for which the bent molecule is strongly favoured.
Based upon these observations, we may imagine that the acti- vation of CO2 on a surface may be by electron transfer from a surface to the CO2 molecule which, in turn, could lead to the occupation of this orbital via the formation of CO2 , which is a bent anion in its equilibrium geometry. If the charge transfer moves from the CO2 molecule to the surface, we would have to consider the formation of a CO2 cation, which would remain in the linear geometry. It is considerable to state that an energeti- cally favoured reaction will involve the anionic species. All other processes require energies that are orders of magnitude larger than those involving CO2.
The ground state of the CO2 system is shown to be a linear system (Fig. 3) with an enthalpy of 1650.6 kJ mol1; whereas, the double-well ground state of CO2 represents a bent geometry (Fig. 3) with an elongated CO bond and an enthalpy of formation of 1604 KJ mol1. The CO2 ion is metastable with a life time of 6090 m sec1 and an autodetachable electron, which may lead to the further dissociation of CO2 on the metal Table 1 Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 with V, Cr and Fe catalysts over various supports (ref. 28)a Entry Catalyst Surface area (m2 g1) Ethyl benzene conversion % Styrene yield % Styrene selectivity % 1

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online surface.4143 Studies by Ge et al.44 with density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations on (110) and (100) surfaces of g-Al2O3 demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 occurs in a bidentate configuration across the OAl bridge sites, forming carbonate species. In a further study, they demonstrated the effect of surface hydroxyls on selective CO2 hydrogenation over an Ni4 cluster supported on g-Al2O3.45 This study revealed that the reaction energy and activation barrier for formate formation are
0.23 eV and 1.25 eV, respectively, whereas those for CO
formation are 0.48 eV and 2.13 eV, respectively.45 This showed that the formate formation is preferred kinetically and CO formation is thermodynamically favorable. An interesting fact was revealed by Liu et al.46 and Casarin et al.47 that CO2 can act as both an electron acceptor and donor. The CO2 2pu (LUMO) orbital accepts electrons from the occupied states of the surface basic sites, whereas the CO2 1pg (HOMO) orbital donates its electrons to the empty states of the surface acidic sites. These fundamental studies on the adsorption behaviour of CO2 revealed the importance of acidbase properties in the develop- ment of catalysts and the utility of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant.
2.3
Role of CO2 activators The activation of carbon dioxide on catalyst surfaces is an important elementary step in CO2-mediated oxidative reactions and has been investigated in a number of surface science studies.
Even though the catalysts are able to activate carbon dioxide in soft oxidant systems, the utilization of some activators, such as alkali metals, promotes the activation and conversion of CO2 which, in turn, has a prominent effect on the catalytic perfor- mance. Kafafiet al.48 studied the activation of carbon dioxide over alkali metals using infrared spectroscopy, which revealed that the reaction of carbon dioxide with Li, Na, K and Cs leads to the formation of MCO2-type species (where M  Li, Na, K, Cs). The activation of CO2 with alkali is dependent on the CO2
valence bond angle (Fig. 3), which in turn is affected by the ionization potential of the alkali metal as well as its ionic radius.
Sugino et al.10 have reported the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 over iron supported on alkali or alkaline earth metals (Li, Na, Ca, Ba and K) impregnated on activated carbon. The highest yield of styrene (40.45%) with more than 90% selectivity with a specific activity of 2% was observed over a lithium-impregnated carbon support, which was comparatively higher than other alkali-impregnated supports. The order of activity of alkali or alkaline earth metals on the styrene forma- tion was as follows: Li > Na > Ca > Ba > K. The order of the alkali metals in the enhancement of the catalytic performance over the iron catalyst is in line with the decreasing ionic radii. As mentioned earlier, the ionic radius of alkali or alkaline earth metals will affect the CO2 valence bond angle, which is an elementary step in determining CO2 activation and catalytic performance.
Badstube et al.13 have impregnated alkali and alkaline earth metals (Li, Be, K, Ca, Mg and Na) in Fe-activated carbon D-90 (Chemviron-Carbon GmbH) and investigated their catalytic performance in the ODH of EB with CO2. The Fe/D-90 catalyst showed 60.7% conversion of EB at 550 C and a styrene selec- tivity 92.7%. In the case of Ca- and Mg-impregnated Fe/D-90, no significant difference in the conversion was found with a slight increased in the selectivity for styrene. In the case of Li, Be, K and Na, there is a significant increase in the conversion of EB and the selectivity of styrene observed. LiFe/D-90 showed the highest conversion of ethyl benzene (75%) with 94.5% selectivity for styrene. The activity of the alkali or alkaline metal-impreg- nated Fe/D-90 showed the following order: Li > Na > Be > K > Ca > Mg. The effect of the mole ratio of carbon dioxide to ethylbenzene over Li, Na and K showed a strong increase in the yield of styrene with an increase in the amount of CO2 in the reaction mixture until the CO2/ethyl benzene ratio was 10. A further increase in the ratio above this value decreased the yield.
This decrease in catalytic performance was attributed to the fact that there may be formation of inactive metal carbonates or oxalates on the surface of the catalysts in the presence of large amounts of CO2, which can be presumed based upon the observations by Paul et al.,49 which suggested that, in carbon dioxide activation with alkali, the excess concentration of carbon dioxide may lead to the formation of oxalates. Park et al. found a change in the physico-chemical and catalytic properties upon the addition of K2O to TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts. The catalytic activity of a non-promoted TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst is higher in the initial 2 h in the stream, after which the activity was marginal diminished due to coke deposition. In contrary to this, the activity of K2O-promoted TiO2ZrO2 catalysts increased continuously with an increase of the reaction time up to 7 h. The difference in conversion of ethyl benzene over K2O-promoted and non-promoted TiO2ZrO2 was found to be
10.42%. The substantial positive influence of K2O on the
conversion of ethyl benzene can be accredited to the higher degree of CO2 activation and may also be due to the removal of coke deposits by the decoking phenomenon (eqn (2)).
Based on these observations, the significance of carbon dioxide as an activator suggests that it plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, alkali or alka- line earth metals can act as promoters and enhance the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions under an optimum ratio of carbon dioxide to the substrate.
2.4
Role of surface/lattice oxygen species The surface/lattice oxygen plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation by donation of oxygen from the metal oxide lattice for abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate by reduc- tion of higher valence states of the metal oxides to lower valence oxides along with the formation of water (eqn (3)).
RCH2CH3 + MOx / RCH]CH2 + H2O + MOx1 (3) CO2 then plays a role in the reoxidation of the lower valence metal oxide to return it back to the original metal oxide state (eqn (4)).
MOx1 + CO2 / MOx + CO (4) Guerrero-Ruiz et al.50 investigated oxygen isotopic exchange with C18O2 over magnesium vanadate phases, a-Mg2V2O7, Mg3V2O8 and b-MgV2O6, in order to understand the behaviour of surface and lattice oxygen atoms. In general, these magnesium This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Energy Environ. Sci., 2012, 5, 94199437  9423 Downloaded by Laurentian University on 02/04/2013 06:05:09.
Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online vanadate catalysts have been extensively studied in propane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with CO2. In the experi- ments carried out, the magnesium vanadate phases were found to contain an 16O isotope, which undergoes oxygen exchange with C18O2, as depicted in eqn (5) and (6).
M16Ox + C18O2 / M18O16Ox1 + C18O16O (5) M16Ox + C18O2 / M18O2 16Ox2 + C16O2 (6) The exchange of oxygen between carbon dioxide and the magnesium vanadate phases was analyzed by an on-line mass quadrupole spectrometer (Balzers QMG 421C) connected to the reactor through a metering leak valve and the ion current was recorded for C18O2, m/z 48; C18O16O, m/z 46; C16O2, m/z 44 and some secondary peaks.
The quantification of the exchange was done via F (18O) values, which give an indication of the exchange kinetics by a specific slope value when F (18O) is plotted versus time (Fig. 4).
The slope values calculated from Fig. 4 for a-Mg2V2O7, Mg3V2O8 and b-MgV2O6 are 2.5  104, 3.8  104 and 4.5  104,respectively. It was observed that a-Mg2V2O7, which is the most selective for the oxidation of propane to propene, has the lowest value of the slope in the F (18O) versus time curve. Considering that these slope values are indicative of the lattice oxygen exchange kinetics, it can be inferred that a good catalyst for selective oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons should possess a minimum of lattice oxygen exchange in the gaseous phase.
These studies by Guerrero-Ruiz et al.50 provided evidence of oxygen exchange between the metal oxide and carbon dioxide in relation to the activity in the dehydrogenation of propane.
However, these experiments did not give direct evidence for the reactions in eqn (3) and (5). A direct evidence for the occurrence of this phenomenon have been provided by studies from Saito et al.28 in the presence of CO2 by transient response techniques in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene (for V, Cr and Fe oxides loaded on activated carbon, powdered diamond, Al2O3 and MgO) over various catalysts. Transient response measure- ments were carried out by connecting the reactor outlet to a continuous detection quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL201, Hiden Analytical Ltd.) to scan the ions of the parent peaks of H2, H2O, CO, CO2, styrene and ethyl benzene, corresponding to m/z values of 2, 18, 28, 44, 104 and 106, respectively. The ethyl benzene dehydrogenation was conducted over vanadium oxide supported on oxidized diamond in an argon flow. The mass spectra suggested that a very steep increase in the H2O formation rate (overshoot) was accompanied by styrene formation, which is attributed to the transfer of the lattice oxygen of vanadium oxide to ethyl benzene to give styrene and H2O (eqn (3)). After exhibiting an overshoot of H2O formation, the water concen- trations decreased to background levels and a gradual increase in H2 was observed with a similar rate of styrene formation. This indicated that,after the consumption of lattice oxygen,the reaction proceeds via simple dehydrogenation, producing H2 (eqn (7)).
C6H5CH2CH3 / C6H5CH]CH2 + H2
(7) The reaction under a CO2 flow showed the constant formation of H2O (eqn (8)) with no significant detection of H2, indicative of the continuous consumption of lattice oxygen in vanadium oxide and its consequential reoxidation by CO2, producing H2O and
CO. Based on the observations of Guerrero-Ruiz et al.50 and
Saito et al., it can be stated that there exist an exchange of O atom between carbon dioxide and the metal oxide. Moreover, it may also be stated that these lattice oxygen species play a vital role as O atom transfer agents for the reaction to proceed in an oxidative manner; whereas CO2 during these reactions maintains the lattice oxygen of the catalyst. The reaction in the absence of CO2 will initially proceed in an oxidative manner, utilizing lattice oxygen, and once saturation is reached it will proceed by simple dehydrogenation.
2.5
Role of the acidbase properties Acidbase bifunctionality plays an important role in CO2- mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
The acidic properties of catalysts play the predominant role in activation of the substrate; whereas the basic sites are for CO2 activation and hydrogen atoms. The reaction pathway over acidbase catalysts has been proposed by Sato et al., who stated that the cooperative action of acidic sites and basic sites is necessary.51 An oxidative dehydrogenation reaction over an acidbase catalyst may partially proceed by simple dehydrogenation and partially by oxidative dehydrogenation; hence, two mechanistic paths havebeen suggested: onerelatingto simple dehydrogenation (eqn (7)) and the other combined with carbon dioxide (eqn (8)).
C6H5CH2CH3 + CO2 / C6H5CH]CH2 + H2O + CO (8) In simple dehydrogenation (Fig. 5), the a-hydrogen atom of ethyl benzene is abstracted by the basic site on the catalyst (Al2O3) leading to formation of carbanions. The carbanion formed loses another H, forming styrene and H2. The reaction with carbon dioxide (Fig. 6) proceeds by activation of CO2 over the strong basic sites followed by abstraction of the a-hydrogen atom of ethyl benzene.

Acidbase catalysis has been widely explored by Park et al. on zirconia-based catalytic systems.52,54 The acid and base proper- ties of TiO2, ZrO2 and 50% TiO2ZrO2 were investigated by the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia and
CO2. The NH3 TPD profiles revealed that the number of acid
sites and their acid strength are in the order ZrO2 < TiO2 < TiO2 ZrO2. The temperature maxima for ZrO2, TiO2 and TiO2ZrO2 were 140, 145, and 187 C, respectively. The shift of the peak maximum from a lower to higher a temperature indicated an increase in the basic strength.24,53,54 The catalytic performance of TiO2, ZrO2 and 50% TiO2ZrO2 (Fig. 7) in the oxidative dehy- drogenation of ethyl benzene revealed the superior activity of TiO2ZrO2 in comparison to the individual oxides. As suggested by Reddy et al., this superior performance of TiO2ZrO2 is accredited to the occurrence of optimum acidity and basicity,24,53,54 which generates new acidbase sites owing to the mixing of TiO2 and ZrO2. This observation has led to the development of several catalytic systems, such as mesoporous silicalite-1-supported TiO2ZrO2,55 K2O/TiO2ZrO2,56 V2O5/ TiO2ZrO2,18 CeO2/TiO2ZrO2,35 V2O5CeO2/TiO2ZrO2 18 and Fe2O3/TiO2ZrO2.57

Role of the redox properties The redox properties of a material play a significant role in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. In many cases, the role of the redox catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation is that of a mediator for the transfer of oxygen from CO2 to the hydro- carbon. The metal oxide is first contacted with the hydrocarbon,resulting in the oxidative dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon with the partial reduction of the metal oxide (eqn (9)).
CnH2n+2 + MxOy / CnH2n + H2O + MxOy1 (9) The reduced metal oxide is then converted to a fully oxidized state by treatment with carbon dioxide (eqn (10)).
MxOy1 + CO2 / MxOy + CO (10) This reaction strategy indeed can provide higher selectivity in comparison with the conventional method, where hydrocarbons are dehydrogenated in steam. However, in oxidative dehydro- genation with O2, a similar oxidative behavior of the redox catalyst is observed but the selectivities are decreased due to higher oxidizing power of O2 compared to CO2.58 The mecha- nism over the redox catalyst proceeds via a Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, which is also referred to as a redox or regenerative mechanism.59 The characteristic feature of this mechanism is that some products of the reaction leave the solid catalyst surface with one or more constituents of the catalyst lattice. In oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the metal oxide lattice participates in the dehydrogenation of the substrate and is partially reduced (eqn (9)). The transfer of an oxygen atom between the catalyst and the gaseous-phase substrate is dependent on the metal oxygen bond strength.
Initial studies of the redox system catalyzing the dehydroge- nation of ethyl benzene to styrene with CO2 were performed over Fig. 5 Pathway for the simple dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene over an acidbase catalyst.51 Fig. 6 Pathway for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 over an acidbase catalyst.51 Fig. 7 Ethyl benzene conversion and styrene product yield over TiO2, ZrO2 and 50% TiO2ZrO2.52,54 Reprinted with permission from ref 54.

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online a ZSM-5-supported iron oxide catalyst. It was found that the active phase in dehydrogenations with CO2 over a ZSM-5-sup- ported iron oxide catalyst is a reduced and isolated magnetite (Fe3O4)-like phase that has an oxygen vacancy in the zeolite matrix.12 Vanadium-based metal oxides systems have been investigated in order to understand redox systems.60 Chang et al. have anticipated the redox nature of the supported vanadium antimony oxide catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkyl aromatics and proposed a generalized form of the redox cycle60 in the following manner: AB + ZO / AB + H2O + Z (reduction step)
AB + CO2 / AB + CO + H2O,
where ZO is an active V-site with a lattice oxygen atom; Z is a reduced V-site with a lattice oxygen vacancy, AB is alkyl benzene and AB is alkenyl benzene.
In the oxidative dehydrogenation over VSb/Al catalysts, the vanadium species are considered to be the active sites because the reducibility of surface antimony ions is much lower compared to that of the vanadium ions. The reduced V-site contains a surface oxygen vacancy that might be associated with either one V3+ or two V4+ atoms in the lattice.60,61 The accumulation of V3+ species represents one mode of catalyst deactivation because the reox- idation of deeply reduced V3+ centers could become a rate-limiting step, as was evidenced for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane over a V2 O5/Al2 O3 catalyst.62 This was also observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 over a V/Al catalyst,where partial reduction from V5+ to V3+ was observed, which led to difficulty in the adsorption of EB on improperly regenerated active sites that could hamper the redox cycle. As a consequence of this reason, increased coke formation and deactivation of the catalyst was observed.60 When the active VOx component was modified by the addition of antimony oxide (VSb/Al), the cata- lyst performance was substantially improved and this can be ascribed to the formation of a well-dispersed VSbO4-like phase with an increased content of mobile lattice oxygen, which is consistent with the fast re-oxidation of the reduced vanadium antimonite phase by CO2, leading to the formation of CO.
A comparison of the CO formation over VSb/Al and V/Al (Fig. 8) by pulse injection of CO2 revealed that the formation of CO is higher over VSb/Al, indicating a fast reoxidation process (eqn (10)) and suggesting that the increased mobility of oxygen in the redox catalyst can have a significant effect on the catalytic performance. The studies by Suzuki et al.63 revealed that the effective redox cycle over vanadium-supported catalysts proceeds via V4+ and V5+. However, the studies by Volta et al. 64 emphasized that, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over V2O7, the bridging VOV oxygen plays an important role in the formation of water (eqn (9)), suggesting the formation of two V4+ cations, which lead to structural changes in the catalyst.
Mamedov and Corber an65 suggested that, in the catalytic reac- tion mechanism, the redox cycle takes place between V4+ and V5+, which suggests that a certain extent of reduction is needed for the selective dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. It was also suggested that the active site is a vacancy formed by the removal of the oxygen bridging the two vanadium ions (V4+(oxygen vacancy)V4+ O2Mn+). This vacant site is able to abstract hydrogen from the substrate with oxygen bridging V4+ and the Mn+ cations. Moreover, this vacant site regains it oxygen by reoxidation with carbon dioxide. Sakurai et al.66 have studied the energetics of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 over vanadium oxide-loaded MgO. The DG (kJ mol1 of vanadium at 800 K) for the reactions occurring in the oxida- tive dehydrogenation between the catalyst and CO2 were calcu- lated over the vanadium oxide catalyst, which suggested that it would be difficult for carbon dioxide to oxidize the bulk vana- dium oxide in a lower valency state. Moreover, the results showed that there is a change in the redox properties of vana- dium when it is supported on MgO which, in turn, also alters the thermochemical parameters. This observation is indicative of an interaction between acidic vanadia and basic magnesia resulting in the formation of mixed oxides, which in turn show a promoting effect on carbon dioxide on the V/MgO catalyst,which is not observed on bulk V2O5. This suggested that the lower valency state vanadium oxide species with carbon dioxide may only occur in mixed oxides that are highly dispersed on magnesium oxide. A report by Wang et al. 67 focusing on a supported chromium oxide catalyst (Cr2O3) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide revealed the existence of Cr3+ and Cr6+ species. Cr6+ undergoes partial reduction to Cr3+ yielding the dehydrogenated product, ethene (eqn (3)), whereas, the role of carbon dioxide is to donate oxygen (eqn (4)). These paths were found to be parallel.
2.7
Role of the support materials The support plays a significant role as it not only provides a high surface area, immobilization and porosity, but can also over- come diffusion problems by maintaining highly dispersed active sites with large fractions on the surface, which are easily acces- sible for the reactants to adsorb. In some instances, both the supported material and the support itself function as a catalyst.

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the perfor- mance of the catalyst. The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties. The oxidic support is regarded as acidic when the surface oxygen atoms are electron-poor, and basic when they are electron-rich. The rehybridization of the orbitals within the metal particle induced by bonding to the support sometimes results in an electron transfer between the support and the metal and a polarization of the metal particle by the electric field of the support or nearby cations, which influences the valence electron distribution within the metal particle.
Saito et al.28 have studied the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene over vanadium, chromium and iron-based cata- lysts (Table 1) with and without a support. The unsupported catalysts, V2O5, V2O3, Cr2O3, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 (Table 1, entries 1, 2, 7, 12 and 13), showed lower conversions compared to the supported catalysts. In all the cases it was found that the acti- vated carbon (AC)-supported catalyst showed the highest conversion, which may be accredited to the high surface area of the catalysts (Table 1, entries 6, 11 and 17) and the high disper- sion of the metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface. This comparison between the bulk metal oxide and the supported one clearly indicates the importance of the support in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The oxidized diamond (O-Dia)-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas (Table 1, entries 3, 8 and 14); however, there is a significant difference in the catalytic activities observed. Two fold and one fold increases were observed compared to the bulk phase for V/O-Dia and Cr/O-Dia, respectively; whereas, in the case of Fe/O-Dia, a small increment in the activity was observed, which may be due to the chemisorbed oxygen species on diamond effecting the redox cycle of iron oxide.68 This suggested that the choice of support for a particular metal oxide system is an important aspect in the determination of catalytic performance.
The studies by Nakagawa et al. on the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide over Cr2O3 supported on oxidized diamond evidenced a synergy between the support and Cr2O3, which promoted the catalytic performance.
A plausible interpretation of such a synergy between Cr2O3 and oxidized diamond revealed the fact that the production of ethane, Cr2O3 or a higher oxidation state of chromium oxides is required. If chromium oxides are dispersed on the oxidized dia- mond surface, the chromium oxides might stabilize and become difficult to reduce. Even if the chromium oxides are reduced with C2H6 or H2, they will be oxidized by CO2 or the oxygen species on the diamond surface. These studies pointed toward the role of the support in the catalytic cycle of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with CO2.
Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehy- drogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity. Unsupported Cr2O3 showed much less activity than silica, alumina and zirconia- supported catalysts; whereas, over titania, the activity was much lower than unsupported Cr2O3. The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion. The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios. The XRD and XPS measurements were unable to explain the significant difference in the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 over titania.
However, the temperature program reduction profiles clearly indicated a weak/insignificant peak of Cr2O3 supported on titania. This suggests that the partial reduction of chromium is a prime requirement for oxidative dehydrogenation over redox catalysts to initiate the reaction (eqn (9)), which is not achieved when titania is used as a support. Another reason that may account for the low activity of Cr2O3/TiO2 is that the reducible ions, Ti 4+, of the support may participate in the exchange of electrons between the distant Cr3+ ions which, in turn, effect the redox cycle. Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with
CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2.
Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place. Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3. Electron transfer should be easy on the unsupported chromia surface, occurring along the Cr3+O Cr6+OCr3+ chains, which effect the reoxidation. Whereas, in supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus,maintaining a better catalytic performance. These studies suggest that the phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts.

Oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 Methane, a principal component of natural gas, is an abundant hydrocarbon resource that is mainly used as a relatively inex- pensive and clean-burning fuel.70 Methane reacts with water at elevated temperatures to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a reforming reaction. The alternative approach with regards to its utilization is by oxidative coupling to form C2H6 and C2H4 using O2 as an oxidant, which is limited largely by the undesir- able formation of CO2 and CO as by-products, which results in a decrease of the selectivity toward coupling products. It was found that the addition of CO2 in this reaction increases the selectivity toward C2H6 and C2H4; however, the conversion was decreased due to poisoning of the centres responsible for CH4 activation.7072 Matrix isolation and electron spin resonance results indicated that CO2 inhibited the secondary reactions between the CH3 radicals and the catalyst.70,72 These investiga- tions have drawn attention to the use of CO2 as an oxidant in the oxidative coupling of methane utilizing two naturally available resources.

DH  196.2 KJ mol1 (12) Asami et al.73 have investigated the oxidative coupling of methane with carbon dioxide over several metal oxides using a flow reaction system. The conversion ratio of carbon dioxide to methane was found to be approximately 2 in most cases. The C2 yield was found to be higher over yttrium and manganese oxides.
Rare earth catalysts, such as yttrium, lanthanum and samarium,showed higher C2 selectivities of about 30%.
Two mechanisms have been proposed for the oxidative coupling of methane with CO2.73,80,81 One of the possible mech- anisms is that CO2 is first adsorbed over the metal oxide and decomposes to form an active oxygen species and CO is released (eqn (13)). The active species oxidizes CH4 to form C2H6 through a methyl radical (eqn (14) and (15); whereas the formation of C2H6 is due to the pyrolysis and ODH of C2H6.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with CO2 can be regarded as a new technology that may completely change the way some of the most important organic chemicals are manufactured.The conversion of alkanes (a by-product of petroleum processing and present in natural gas) to olefins (ethylene, propylene, butene and butadiene) is in great demand in the chemical industry. High operational costs and environmental issues have made this conversion profitable only ona very large scale. With the successful development of ODH, high yields of olefins may be possible through the conversion of much smaller volumes of alkanes.
In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy. Moreover, capital and operational efficiencies are gained by eliminating the need for a furnace,decoking shutdowns,lower operating temperatures,fewer material demands, fewer maintenance operations and the use of a greater proportion of the alkanes in the olefin conversion process.
Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic58 and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields.
The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non- oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct (eqn (19)). In addition, carbon deposition during ODH is eliminated by the Boudouard reaction (eqn (2)), leading to stable catalytic activity.
Here, we summarize the oxidative conversion of C2C4 with carbon dioxide over different catalytic systems.

Oxidative dehydrogenation to C2H6 by CO2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 over catalytic systems will not only proceed in a completely oxidative manner,but also partially by a simple dehydrogenation.
The overall reaction thermodynamics reveal that the CO2 ODH of ethane is comparatively more favourable with simple dehydrogenation (eqn (19) and (20)).80,82 C2H6 + CO2 / C2H4 + CO + H2O DH  134 KJ mol1 (19) C2H6 / C2H4 + H2 DH  137 KJ mol1 (20) The initial investigations over the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes were performed by Krylov et al. over various metal oxides systems.83,84 Since then, various metal oxide-based systems have been developed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. Table 3 summarizes the various catalytic systems that have been investigated in the oxidative dehydroge- nation of ethane.

Oxidative dehydrogenation to C3H8 by CO2. Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene. There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking.
In addition to these, the most widely practised technology in the Middle East is propane dehydrogenation due to the abun- dance of oil/gas resources. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene.
Michorczyk and Ogonowski105 have studied the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 over metal oxides (Ga2O3, Cr2O3 and Fe2O3) sup- ported and unsupported on g-Al2O3 and SiO2. Furthermore,they have also studied the effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion 9428  Energy Environ.

2.9.3
Oxidative dehydrogenation to n-C4H10 by CO2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-C4H10 is very demanding due to the extensive utilization of butene or its products in the polymer industry. The dehydrogenation of n-butane is an equilibrium endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperatures to obtain high yields of butene. However, the high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to lower alkanes and coke, resulting in a decline of the product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.120 Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide. The answer to this problem may be oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. However, very few studies have been reported in the literature for the ODH of n-butane where CO2 is used as an oxidant. The oxidative dehy- drogenation of C4H10 with CO2 was investigated by Krylov et al.83,84 over a CrMnLaV/Al2O3 catalyst and the conversion of C4H10 was found to be 8184% with selectivity for C2C4 in the range of 7678% at 630650 C. Ge et al.121 have investigated the role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over a VMgO catalyst. It was found that the increase in CO2 partial pressure decreases the n-butane conversion with an increase in selectivity and yield to C4 dehydrogenation products.
The selectivity toward C4 dehydrogenation products of up to
70.2% and a yield of 34.1% were obtained by adding an
appropriate amount of CO2 in the feed at 873 K. Urlan et al.120 investigated the effect of CO2 on the catalytic ODH of n-butane with oxygen over TiP2O7 catalysts. A decrease in the catalytic activity with carbon dioxide as the unique oxidant (in the absence of oxygen) was noted over the TiP2O7 catalysts. The sole pres- ence of oxygen only tends to increase the activity of these cata- lysts. The poor activity of the catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to the lack of reoxidation on the catalyst surface owing to the strong adsorption of CO2 on the surface. Nakagawa et al.112 have observed a promoting effect of CO2 on the butene yield over oxidized, diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 cata- lysts in comparison to simple dehydrogenation in an Ar atmo- sphere.
Recently, Park et al. investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane with CO2 over VOx/SnO2ZrO2,which exhibited excellent performance with 22.34% conversion of n-butane with 36.63% selectivity for the C4 olefins.122
2.9.4
Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkyl aromatics. Catalytic dehydrogenations of alkyl aromatics are representative processes to produce important monomers for synthetic polymers. Among the ODH of alkyl aromatics, ethyl benzene (EB) holds significant attention owing to the importance of its product, styrene, which is a very important monomer for synthetic rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) resins and polystyrene. Currently, more than 90% of styrene is produced by direct the dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene in the presence of excess steam over an iron oxide catalyst in an adiabatic reactor.58 This process is associated with drawbacks, such as thermodynamic limitations, a low conversion rate, the recycling of unreacted reactants, a high endothermic energy (DH298  123.6 kJ cal mol1), high energy consumption and the deactivation of the catalyst by coke formation.28,54,60 The use of oxygen can overcome the thermodynamic limitations,but leads to significant loss of styrene selectivity due to the Table 2 Catalyst systems for the oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 Catalyst

dehydrogenation.52 There has been substantial work done toward the development of catalysts for ethyl benzene dehydrogenation and this has been summarized in Table 5. The present challenges for the industrial applications of this technology involve process feasibility studies, catalyst pro- cessing, reaction engineering, improvement of carbon dioxide conversions, reactor design to decrease energy consumption and the development of catalysts with appropriate CO2 promoters.

Carbon dioxide as a promoter Carbon dioxide can be regarded as a promoter in a catalytic system when its co-presence influences the kinetics, conversion,selectivity, product distribution or all of these factors.

The product analysis of the reaction performed with O2 revealed the formation of 2-hydroxyte- trahydrofuran, butyrolactone, succinic anhydride, succinalde- hyde and 2-hydroperoxotetrahydrofuran with an even distribution; whereas the analysis of products from the reaction performed under CO2O2 predominantly showed the formation of butyrolactone as the major product; other products were approximately 0.1%. The product distributions from reaction in CO2O2 were different as compared to pure O2. At the same time, Yoo et al.27 have observed an improvement in the conversion and selectivity for the gas-phase oxidation of alkyl aromatics over Fe/Mo/borosilicate molecular sieves. Further studies have been made by Park et al. on Co/Mn/Ni Br cata- lysts29,136 in the liquid-phase oxidation of p-xylene and a similar observation was made. Recently, Park et al. have investigated this profound effect of CO2 on the oxidation of cyclic olefins over mesoporous carbon nitride and coined these systems carbon dioxide-promoted systems. These systems operate at sub-critical pressures of CO2 and can easily be discerned from a carbon dioxide-expanded system and a super critical carbon dioxide system by low pressure modus operandi.
3.1
Homogeneous system Aresta et al. investigated the ring opening reaction of THF and observed the increased production of butyrolactone in the case of O2CO2 compared to only O2. Moreover, it was also observed that the relative rate of butyrolactone formation (Fig. 9) in the co-presence of CO2 was greatly enhanced.
It was suggested that in the O2CO2 system, the formed metal peroxocarbonate species serve as oxygen transfer agents to the oxophile substrate. A further study by Aresta et al. on the oxidation of styrene over a Rh complex depicted the formation of metal peroxocarbonate by insertion into the OO bond of Rh(h2O2) complexes.137 It was observed that the reaction of styrene over RhCl(PEt2-Ph)3 in the presence of O2 yielded benzaldehyde as the major product with minor amounts of epoxide and phenyl methyl ketone. These products were formed Table 5 Catalyst systems for the ODH of ethyl benzene with CO2 Catalyst

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online according to a molecular ratio of 5 : 3 : 1, respectively. In the case of O2CO2, a different distribution of products was observed. The phenylacetaldehyde was the major product followed by styrene epoxide, phenyl methyl ketone and benzal- dehyde in the molar ratio 5 : 5 : 3 : 1. It was suggested that, in the presence of alkenes or other species, an oxygen transfer from the peroxocarbonate metal complex to the oxophile substrate can occur, which forms a different intermediate (Scheme 2) and leads to an increase in the formation of phenylacetaldehyde and epoxide.135 Park et al.136 have investigated the promotional behaviour of CO2 in the liquid-phase oxidation of p-xylene, p-toulaldehyde and toluene with molecular oxygen using an MC-type catalyst (Co/Mn/Br). The co-presence of CO2 contributed to the enhanced reaction rate as well as higher conversions and selec- tivities. It was found that the promotional behaviour was due to the formation of peroxocarbonate species, which were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies under reac- tion conditions with and without CO2. A well resolved manga- nese hyperfine pattern in the presence of CO2 was observed,indicating the formation of peroxocarbonate species. In a piece of follow up research, Park et al. investigated the oxidation of various alkyl aromatics using MC-type catalysts.29 The oxida- tions were performed using molecular oxygen as the oxidant (with N2 as the balance gas) and a comparative reaction was performed in the co-presence of CO2 with the same amount of oxygen.
The liquid-phase oxidation of p-xylene (Table 6) over an MC- type catalyst resulted in 57.2% conversion of p-xylene; whereas the co-presence of CO2 improved the conversion to 66.8%.
Moreover, it was observed that, in O2/CO2, an increased yield towards terephthalic acid was observed.
The oxidation of p-toluic acid over the MC-catalyst (Table 7) in the co-presence of CO2 showed a 12% increase in the conversion as compared to oxidation in only O2. Moreover, there was an improvement in the yield of terephthalic acid from 58.2 to
64.9%. These results indicate that the catalytic performance is
remarkably boosted by CO2.
The oxidation of ethyl benzene to acetophenone and benzoic acid over an MC-catalyst revealed that the selectivity of benzoic acid was 56% in O2, whereas the selectivity in the co-presence of CO2 was 38% (Table 8). The predominant product in the co-presence of CO2 was acetophenone, which indicated that the one-oxygen transfer oxygenate was the dominant product in the co-presence of CO2, whereas the dioxygen transfer oxygenate was the key product in pure O2.
The oxidation of p-methylanisole (Table 9) over an MC-type catalyst indicated that p-methoxyphenol is formed as a major product along with a small amount of minor products, p-ani- saldehyde and p-anisic acid. Whereas, in the co-presence of CO2,an increase in the yield of p-anisaldehyde was observed, which again indicates the role of CO2 in assisting monooxygen transfer.
3.2
Heterogeneous systems Amoco Chemical Research Laboratory investigated the activa- tion of CO2 over the CVD of Fe/Mo/DBH (partially deboro- nated borosilicate molecular sieve, HAMS-1B-3) in the gas- phase oxidation of p-xylene to terephthaldehyde and p-tolualdehyde.27 The oxidation reaction of p-xylene was carried out in two feed streams having different compositions, namely p-xylene/O2/N2/He and p-xylene/O2/CO2/N2.
The catalytic activity at different temperatures in both the feeds (Fig. 10) revealed that the conversions are very high in the co-presence of
CO2. This increased conversion was attributed to the formation
of peroxycarbonate species over the catalyst surface. Moreover,it was also found that, with an increase in the conversion, the side reactions also became more noticeable in the presence of carbon dioxide, which may be due to the enhanced acidity generated by the carbon dioxide molecules adsorbed on the surface of the DBH matrix.
The conversion of p-xylene was 84.1% in O2/CO2, whereas in an O2 stream it was 60.7% (Table 10). It was found that the selectivity is weakly affected by the presence of
CO2.

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online The profound effect of CO2 was the suppression of the burning of p-xylene as depicted in Table 10. The significant formation of CO2 in the O2/N2/He feed indicatea the burning of p-xylene.
Recently, Park et al. have investigated the promotional effect of carbon dioxide over mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN) as a metal-free oxidation catalyst.138 These mesoporous carbon nitride materials possess oxygen functionalities that serve as active sites for oxidation and the high nitrogen content in the carbon nitride matrix behaves like a CO2-philic surface for the activation of carbon dioxide. It is believed that this synergy is responsible for facilitating the oxidation of cyclic olefins by molecular oxygen in the co-presence of CO2 below sub-critical conditions. The oxidation of cyclic olefins was performed in O2/N2 and O2/CO2 to understand the role of carbon dioxide. It was observed that the co-presence of CO2 augmented the conversion of cyclic olefins and a significant difference was observed in the conversion and selectivity. Owing to these facts, Park et al. have quantified the promotional effect for the first time as a percentage difference in the conversion between the O2/N2 and O2/CO2 systems, which can be represented as DC (%) and can be calculated by eqn (21):

: The influence of CO2 was observed in the oxidation of cyclo- hexene at different concentrations of CO2 (Table 11). The results indicated that, at a ratio of 0.066 O2 (entry 1), no conversion of cyclohexene was observed. This might be due to the low partial pressure of O2, which was insufficient to achieve the product whereas, at all other gas ratios, higher conversions were observed in the O2/CO2 system. Moreover, a key observation regarding the DC% value revealed that, at a high amount of CO2, higher DC% values were observed. No significant change in the catalytic performance and DC% was observed after an increment of the gas ratio beyond 0.333, indicating saturation of activity.

A comparison of the selectivities in O2/N2 and O2/CO2 showed that the epoxide selectivity was comparatively higher in O2/CO2, which suggested that the mechanistic pathway may be changed in the presence of carbon dioxide to enhance the conversion and change the selectivity. In order to get insight into the promotional aspects, the gaseous mixture from the autoclave was investigated by IR spectroscopy.
3.3
Role of CO2 and its promotional aspects The role of CO2 over the metal-based system was found to be the formation of peroxycarbonate species, which are considered to be more active (even compared to hydrogen peroxide) in oxida- tion reactions.139 The formation of such metal peroxocarbonate species was evidenced by Aresta et al.137 in their spectroscopic studies and a mechanism for the formation of peroxycarbonate has been proposed (Scheme 3).
This metal peroxocarbonate species is regarded as an active species and shows activity mimicking monoxygenases. In a study on an MC-type catalyst for the oxidation of alkyl aromatics, Park et al.136 made a similar observation via an EPR study and observed the formation of metal peroxocarbonate species by hyperfine splitting of manganese in the co-presence of carbon dioxide. Yoo et al.27 suggested the formation of peroxocarbonate over Fe/Mo/DBH (partially deboronated borosilicate molecular sieve) and the formation of the peroxycarbonate is depicted in Fig. 11.
All the aforementioned catalytic systems consist of transitional metal catalysts and work when CO2 is coupled with oxygen.
Another possibility for the occurrence of this promotional effect in the reaction occurring over metal oxide systems in O2/CO2 gaseous mixtures may arise through an oxygen exchange between O2 and CO2, which would enhance the rate of reaction. Such exchanges have been observed by Iwata et al. during isotope labeling studies over several metal oxide systems.140 Recently, Park et al. have observed the enhanced oxidation of cyclic olefins in the co-presence of CO2 with molecular oxygen over mesoporous carbon nitrides as metal-free catalysts.138 An investigation of the surface properties after the reaction revealed the occurrence of carbamate, which was indicated in the FTIR spectrum as a new band at 1419 cm1.141 This observation indicated the initial activation of carbon dioxide takes place by the formation of surface carbamate. The IR spectra of the gaseous mixtures after the reaction depicted the existence of additional bands around 2174 cm1 and 2115 cm1, which may correspond to a gaseous carbon monoxide doublet, whereas no such absorption bands were observed in the IR spectra of the gaseous mixtures before the reaction. This observation revealed the formation of CO, which indicates that the enhanced catalytic performance may be attributed to CO2 serving as an oxygen atom source.138,141 The formation of CO has been reported earlier over nitrogen-containing heterocyclics.142144 However,further studies are required in order to understand the complete mechanism over the carbon nitride system.

Current status and future perspectives Establishing a chemical industry based on the utilization of CO2 is a long-term goal as well as a fascinating dream for synthetic chemists and engineers. However, it could be made possible by utilization in current industrial processes, such as the oxidative Table 11 The influence of CO2 on the oxidation of cyclohexene over

Published on 02 August 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C2EE22409G View Article Online dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Among the oxidative dehy- drogenation processes with CO2, ethyl benzene oxidative dehy- drogenation has been moved from bench-scale to pilot-scale. At present, most ethyl benzene dehydrogenation plants are run by a simple dehydrogenation process using a superheated steam,which leads to the loss of a large amount of latent heat upon condensation at the gasliquid separator. In addition, this reac- tion is thermodynamically limited as well as being energy consuming.
Hence, the use of oxygen can overcome the thermodynamic limitation but leads to a significant loss of styrene selectivity due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates. Based upon these observations, Park and researchers have developed a novel process for the dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene (Fig. 12) to produce styrene using carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant.145 The process involves the use of a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst and the operation condition is 560 C. The process can be run by the direct utilization of CO2, which may be obtained as by- product from petrochemical oxidation or the reforming industry.
The high selectivity of styrene in this selective dehydrogenation process suggests that a $2.7 million saving for 0.6 Mt of styrene monomer per year could be made. The calculation, based upon Mimura et al.11, reveals that there is significant energy saving potential compared to the steam process of ethyl benzene dehy- drogenation. The comparison between the steam process and oxidative dehydrogenation process is tabulated in Table 13.
These results reveal that, in the commercial process, the energy required for input and output is much higher than the carbon dioxide process. The energy consumption in the separator and reactor is higher than in the commercial process. The calculation of the total process energy estimated for the commercial process using steam is 1.5  109 calories per ton of styrene and, for the CO2 process, it is estimated to be 6.3  108 calories per ton of styrene. This will contribute to a 33% energy saving vs the conventional process and a saving of $6.5 million dollars for
0.6 Mt of styrene monomer per year. The process is under veri-
fication through pilot-scale work so that process and engineering data necessary for industrial applications can be further collected. An on-site mini-pilot plant is operating at Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC). The scale of the pilot plant is 100 kg of styrene monomer per day. The SGC has joined the project as a cooperating company and recently constructed a pilot-scale demonstration unit in the Daesan Petrochemical Complex and is still testing the catalyst performance for this process. Another process, the ISOCO2 process, developed by Park et al.146 in collaboration with SABIC (Saudi Basic Industry Corporation) is under investigation at Inha University, which is regarded to be more promising than the earlier processes. The process has moved to bench-scale and is under study with regards to the process economics, with the reactor design being per- formed at SABIC (Saudi Arabia). The industrial implementation of such a process may provide a boast to the economics of styrene monomer production, provide energy savings and alleviating increasing carbon dioxide levels.
The promotional effects have been demonstrated by Samsung General Co. at the bench-scale in the oxidation of alkyl aromatics, hydrocarbons and partially oxidized aromatics to acids using (CoMnBr) MC-type catalysts with/or without alkali or alkaline earth metals in the co-presence of CO2. Sam- sung General Chemicals has claimed that carrying out the reac- tion in an atmosphere containing appreciable amounts of carbon dioxide accelerates the oxidation of p-xylene to PTA by as much as 26%. The process advantages involve higher quality crude PTA with less partially oxidized components. This development could offer significant cost savings in both the oxidation and purification sections of a new PTA plant and can also be employed in the revamping of existing units.
There is a lot of scope and challenges for catalyst development in these areas. At present, research on oxidative dehydrogenation is mainly focused on acidbase and redox catalysts, which are limited to the bench-scale. The challenges for industrial imple- mentation involve increasing CO2 conversions with minimal coke deposition, improving catalytic performances per pass and the thermal stability of the catalyst. In the oxidative coupling of methane, there is still a great barrier to increasing the conversion due to poisoning of the centres responsible for CH4 activation. A clear insight is required at the molecular level to understand the pertinent mechanism and distinguish the active sites to obtain an optimum performance with a maximum conversion of CH4 and high selectivity for C2.
It is envisioned that the research utilizing carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter at the laboratory level can be regarded Fig. 12 Schematic diagram of the dehydrogenation process for EB by using carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant.145 Table 13 Energy requirement for the commercial process and CO2 process11 Energy required Commercial processa
