1. Introduction
Nowadays, membrane technologies are be- coming more frequently used for separation of wide varying mixtures in the petrochemical-re- lated industries and can compete successfully with traditional schemes [15]:• The technology behind membrane gas separa- tion is potentially an energy-saving one, be- cause the separation process takes place with- out phase transition. • It is also better for the environment, since the membrane approach requires the use of rela- tively simple and non-harmful materials. doi:10.1016/j.desal.2007.10.042 200

• The recovery of minor but valuable compo- nents from a main stream using membranes can be done without substantial additional en- ergy costs. • Compared with conventional techniques,membranes can offer a simple, easy-to-oper- ate, low-maintenance process option. • The development of novel materials for gas membrane manufacturing such as organic polymeric, hybrid organic-inorganic and inor- ganic will expand the use of membrane tech- nology into new fields of applications in the petrochemical industry. • The process is simple. • There are diverse applications which can be studied by the same basic formulations. • The process is generally carried out at atmo- spheric conditions which, besides being energy efficient, can be important for sensitive appli- cations encountered in pharmaceutical and food industry. • Modules can be added and optimized in a pro- cess design to achieve the desired separation. • Their systems have a low capital cost, com- pact size, modular configuration, and low spe- cific power consumption, which reduce the production cost. • It is a clean process and requires simple and inexpensive filtration. • The process is continuous and the membranes do not require regeneration, unlike the adsorp- tion or the absorption processes, which require a regeneration step leading to the use of two solid beds or a solvent regeneration unit.
In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene,ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile,and isopropanol. An important step in the manu- facture of olefins is large-scale separation of the olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]. Fur- thermore, dehydrogenation, oxidative coupling of methane, steam reforming of methane and water gas shift reaction are some important reactions in petrochemical industry.
Membrane gas separation is attractive because of its simplicity and low energy cost, but it has one major drawback and that is a reverse rela- tionship between selectivity and permeability.
Nano composite membranes, in which selectivity and permeability can simultaneously be improved,solve this problem.
Petrochemical waste streams may contain phe- nolic compounds or aromatic amines. They are highly toxic and at high concentrations are inhibi- tory to biological treatment. Membrane aromatic recovery system (MARS) is a relatively new pro- cess for recovery of aromatic acids and bases.
Wastewater in petrochemical industry is cur- rently treated by activated sludge process with pretreatment of oil/water separation. Tightening effluent regulations and increasing need for reuse of treated water have generated interest in the treatment of petrochemical wastewater with the advanced membrane bio-reactor (MBR) process.
In this paper, membrane and their application in some important petrochemical processes, nano composite membranes and membrane bioreactors are reviewed.
2. What is a membrane?
Membrane is defined essentially as a barrier,which separates two phases and restricts trans- port of various chemicals in a selective manner. A membrane can be homogenous or heterogeneous,symmetric or asymmetric in structure, solid or liq- uid; can carry a positive or negative charge or be neutral or bipolar. Transport through a membrane can be affected by convection or by diffusion of individual molecules, induced by an electric field or concentration, pressure or temperature gradi- ent. The membrane thickness may vary from as small as 10 microns to few hundred micrometers.
The principal types of membrane are shown sche-

3. Membrane processes
Transport through the membrane takes place when a driving force is applied to the components in the feed. In most of the membrane processes,the driving force is a pressure difference or a con- centration (or activity) difference across the mem- brane. Parameters such as pressure, concentration (or activity) and even temperature may be included in one parameter, the chemical potential μ.
Another driving force in membrane separations is the electrical potential difference. This driving force only influences the transport of charged particles or molecules. The membrane processes,according to their driving forces, are classified in Table 1 [11]; the status of developed, developing and yet-to-be developed industrial membrane technologies is summarized in Table 2 [7] and a detail explanation of different membrane pro- cesses is represented in Table 3.
3.1. Gas separation by membranes
The separation of mixtures of gases is per- formed with the objective of obtaining one or more of the constituents in a pure form. There are many applications in both large scale and small scale processes. Separation can be achieved by several methods based on different physical and chemi- cal properties of the species. 202

There are four important methods applied to the separation of gases: absorption, adsorption,cryogenics and membranes (Table 4). Process eco- nomics will determine which of these methods is used for any particular applications [8,2228].
Membrane separation based on selective gas permeation competes directly with other three mentioned methods in many applications. Mem- branes offer versatility and simplicity in compari- son to other methods, which must be balanced against limitations of medium purity and the need for recompression [22]. All the membrane sepa- ration processes have the common feature that separation is achieved via a membrane.
This process competes with technology alter- natives such as adsorption, cryogenic distillation,etc in niche application areas. The membrane pro- cess has certain advantageous, i.e. compactness and light in weight, low labor intensity, modular design permitting easy expansion or operation at Table 1 Classification of membrane processes according to their driving forces [11] Pressure difference Concentration (activity) difference Temperature difference Electrical potential difference Microfiltration Ultrafiltration Nanofiltration Reverse osmosis Piezodialysis Gas separation Pervaporation Carrier mediated transport Dialysis Diffusion dialysis Membrane distillation Electrodialysis Table 2 Status of membrane processes [7] Category Process Status Developed industrial membrane separation technologies Microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis Well-established unit operations. No major breakthroughs seem imminent.
Developing industrial membrane separation technologies Gas separation, pervaporation A number of plants have been installed.
Market size and number of applications served are expanding.
To-be-developed industrial membrane separation technologies Carrier facilitated transport membranes,piezodialysis Major problems remain to be solved before industrial systems will be installed on a large scale partial capacity, low maintenance (no moving parts), low energy requirements and low cost.
Membranes made of polymers and copolymers in the forms of flat film or hollow fibers have been used for gas separation. It is possible even with the two extreme types of membrane considered,i.e. porous and nonporous. The transport mecha- nisms through these two types of membrane are completely different. In porous membranes when gas transport takes place by viscous flow, no sepa- ration is achieved because the mean free path of the gas molecules is very small relative to the pore diameter. By decreasing the pore diameter of the pores in the membrane, the mean free path of the gas molecules may become greater than the pore diameter. This kind of gas flow is called Knudsen flow. The separation of two gases by a Knudsen flow mechanism depends on the ratio of the square root of their corresponding molecular weights.
This means that low separation factors are gener-

205 Table 4 A comparison between gas separation technologies [22] ally obtained. High separation can only be achieved via a cascade operation involving a num- ber of modules connected together [11]. Where the transport of gases occurs through nonporous membranes, Knudsen flow is not involved. How- ever, when these nonporous membranes are used in a composite membrane where a dense top layer is supported by a porous substructure, Knudsen flow may contribute to the total flow depending on the pore sizes in the sub layer. Gas separation through nonporous membranes depends on dif- ferences in the permeabilities of various gases through a given membrane [11,2931]. Ideal gas separation membranes possess a high flux and selectivity. However, generally a trade-off can be observed, i.e., high fluxes or high permeabilities are related to low selectivities and vice versa. High permeable materials are used if high selectivities are not required. If a moderate selectivity is re- quired, then low permeable materials based on Technology Advantages Disadvantages Cryogenic (without distillation) High recovery of products Moderate purity of light products (e.g. H2 up to 98%) Can operate at high pressures Low cost Low pressure loss of light product Cannot achieve very high purity of light products Cryogenic (with distillation) High recovery of products High purity of light products (e.g. H2 up to 99.5%) when using hydrocarbon wash processes Can operate at high pressures Good purity of heavy products Low pressure loss of light product High cost High energy consumption Absorption Simple process Low pressure loss of light product Poor separation characteristics, i.e. low purity light ends or low recovery of heavy ends Adsorption (pressure swing) Very high purity of light product (e.g. 99.99% H2) Simple process Low recovery Operates most favorably at lower pressures (20-30 bar) Adsorption (thermal swing) Can remove minor components virtually completely Expensive for bulk removal of impurities glassy polymers will be employed. In practice, a balance must be found between permeability and selectivity.
The process of gas permeation is a relatively simple process which has expanded in use rap- idly since it was introduced commercially in 1979.
Since that time approximately 20 or more com- panies have come to the market place with equip- ment. The range of applications covers the sup- ply of pure or enriched gases such as He, N2 and O2 from air, the separation of acid gases such as CO2 and H2S, the separation of H2 in the petro- chemical and chemical industries and a variety of smaller applications [22]. Table 5 shows applica- tions established in the field of membrane gas separation [32]. An overview of various applica- tions and materials can be found in the literature [7,11,3340].
Separation of olefin and paraffin gases is one of the most important processes in the petrochemi- 206

cal industry. In 1998, the United States produced 52 billion pounds of ethylene and 29 billion pounds of propylene [41]. Various petrochemical streams contain olefin and other saturated hydro- carbons. These streams typically originate from steam cracking units (ethylene production), cata- lytic cracking units (motor gasoline production),or the dehydrogenation of paraffins [4247]. Dur- ing the years, different processes have been used for the separation of olefin-paraffin mixtures, such as low-temperature distillation, extractive distil- lation, physical or chemical adsorption and physi- cal or chemical absorption [28].
Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-in- tensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of com- ponents. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process. This large capital expense and energy cost have cre- ated incentive for extensive research in this area Table 5 Gas membrane applications and suppliers [32] Gas separation Application Suppliers

of separations, and membrane separations have been considered as an attractive alternative [48 56]. In searching for membrane materials, one generally looks not only for a favorable combi- nation of required permeability and selectivity, but also for an improvement in mechanical proper- ties of the membrane [1].
3.1.1. Solid membranes
As olefin/paraffin separation is an important process in petrochemical industry, in this section the use of solid membranes in this process is re- viewed. Furthermore, the application of nanotechnology in the production of membranes and their separation performance is investigated.

3.1.1.2. Nano composite gas separation mem-
branes Membrane gas separations are attractive be- cause of their simplicity and low energy costs,but often limited by insufficient gas flux. This problem is specially challenging because the per- meability of a material is frequently inversely re- lated to its selectivity. Recently, polymerinor- ganic nano composite materials have been devel- oped to improve the physical properties of poly- mer membranes.
