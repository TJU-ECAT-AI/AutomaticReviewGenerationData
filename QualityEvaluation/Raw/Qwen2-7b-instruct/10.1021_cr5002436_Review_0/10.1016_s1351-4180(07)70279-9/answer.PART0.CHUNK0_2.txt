[1] "Dow Chemical is developing a process for making olefins from methane."
[2] "The methane is reacted"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The production of olefins from methane involves the chemical reaction of methane, a hydrocarbon gas, to produce lighter hydrocarbons known as olefins. This process is significant for the chemical industry because it enables the conversion of natural gas, a widely available resource, into valuable chemical products. The development of such a process by Dow Chemical highlights advancements in catalytic technologies that can potentially reduce the environmental impact and cost of olefin production, as methane is a more abundant feedstock compared to traditional sources of olefins like naphtha.
