1. The development of processes for making olefins from methane by Dow Chemical addresses the need for efficient and environmentally friendly methods of olefin synthesis. These processes can potentially reduce the dependency on traditional fossil fuel sources and offer a sustainable alternative for olefin production. The use of calcium-based materials in biodiesel production facilitates easier separation and eliminates the requirement for purification, streamlining the manufacturing process. This innovation can lead to cost savings and enhanced operational efficiency in biodiesel production. Additionally, Nippon Oil Corp's continuous process for selectively removing spent FCC catalysts from FCC reactors utilizes the magnetic properties of these catalysts. By leveraging this property, the company enables a more effective and efficient catalyst regeneration or recovery process, which can enhance the sustainability and economic viability of the refining industry.
