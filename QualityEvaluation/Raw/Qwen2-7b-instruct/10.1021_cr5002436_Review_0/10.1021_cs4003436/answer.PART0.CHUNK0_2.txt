[1] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000."
[2] "Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."
[3] "It is expected that new steam crackers will provide sufficient ethylene to meet the growing demand. Propylene production will increase as well; however, according to experts the production capacity will be insufficient to cover the demand."
[4] "The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values."
[5] "Researchers in the field use different ways to present their catalytic data. The product selectivity for iron-based catalysts is generally reported excluding CO2. Selectivity can be expressed based on weight (wt %: g of a product × 100/g of hydrocarbons), molar-based (moles of a product × 100/total moles of hydrocarbons) or carbon-based (% C: carbon atoms in a product × 100/total carbon atoms present in hydrocarbons)."
[6] "From Figure 9 it can be observed that selectivities to C2C4 olefins up to 75% were obtained using potassium-promoted catalyst. These catalysts were synthesized combining different promoters."
[7] "Promoted bulk catalysts could be considered as the most interesting option for FTO because of their high selectivity to light olefins, low methane production, low cost, and simple synthesis procedures."
[8] "In Figure 12 it is shown the FeMnK/Sil-2, FeMn/MgO, and the FeNaS catalysts prepared on inert supports displayed a high activity combined with high C2C4 olefins selectivity."

1. Ethylene is a significant petrochemical with numerous applications in various industries, including the production of chemicals like ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride. In 2000, ethylene was among the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States. Ethylene production typically relies on steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, naphtha, gas oil, and condensates are used for ethylene production, whereas in North America and the Middle East, ethane and propane are the primary feedstocks. Experts predict that new ethylene production capacities will meet growing demand, but propylene production may fall short.

2. Iron-based catalysts are predominantly used for FTO due to their low cost, lower activity, higher olefin content, lower reactivity to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and lower methane selectivity at high temperatures necessary for alpha reduction.

3. Researchers often express product selectivity in terms of weight (wt %), molar-based (moles of a product × 100/total moles of hydrocarbons), or carbon-based (% C: carbon atoms in a product × 100/total carbon atoms present in hydrocarbons).

4. Catalysts containing potassium promoters showed high selectivity to C2C4 olefins (up to 75%) when synthesized with different promoters.

5. Potassium-promoted bulk catalysts are considered attractive for FTO due to their high selectivity for light olefins, low methane production, low cost, and straightforward synthesis.

6. The FeMnK/Sil-2, FeMn/MgO, and FeNaS catalysts, when prepared on inert supports, displayed high activity and high selectivity for C2C4 olefins.

1. 乙烯是重要的石油化工产品，广泛应用于多个行业，如乙苯、乙二醇和乙烯二氯等中间体的生产。2000年，乙烯在美国位列化工产量前30名。乙烯生产通常依赖于蒸汽裂解多种烃类原料。欧洲和亚洲主要使用石脑油、柴油和凝析油生产乙烯，而北美和中东则以乙烷和丙烷为原料。专家预测，新建设的乙烯产能将满足日益增长的需求，但丙烯产能可能不足。

2. 铁基催化剂在费托合成中占主导地位，原因在于其成本低廉、活性较低、生成的烯烃含量较高、对二次氢化反应的活性较低以及在高温度下驱动α值降低时能产生较低的甲烷选择性。

3. 研究人员常将产物选择性以重量百分比（wt %）、摩尔百分比（摩尔产物×100/总烃摩尔数）或碳百分比（碳原子产物×100/总碳原子）的形式表达。

4. 含有钾促进剂的催化剂在合成过程中表现出高达75%的C2C4烯烃选择性，并结合了不同的促进剂。

5. 含钾促进剂的块状催化剂因其高烯烃选择性、低甲烷生成、低成本和简单合成过程而被认为是费托合成的有吸引力的选择。

6. 当在惰性支撑材料上制备时，FeMnK/Sil-2、FeMn/MgO和FeNaS催化剂显示出高活性和高C2C4烯烃选择性。
