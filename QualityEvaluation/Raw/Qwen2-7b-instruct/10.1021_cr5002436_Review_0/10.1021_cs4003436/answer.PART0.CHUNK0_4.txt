[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins."
[2] "These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1)."
[3] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or it is recovered from refinery processes, especially from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[4] "The growth of the demand for lower olefins will inevitably increase the demand for the feedstocks required in the petrochemical industry."
[5] "Several processes have been developed in an attempt to solve one or more of the challenges encountered by the lower olefins industry."
[6] "Apart from high oil prices, there are some other drivers in the search for alternative routes and feedstocks."
[7] "Although coal has long been used as a feedstock for the chemical industry..."
[8] "The rapid increase of energy demand, the high oil and gas prices, and the strategic drive of coal-rich countries to reduce their dependence on imported crude oil have led to reconsider coal as a primary feedstock for the production of chemicals."
[9] "The use of biomass is mainly encouraged by its carbon-neutral nature."
[10] "With the recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S., (16, 17) new possibilities are open for the transformation of natural gas to olefins."
[11] "The use of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets."
[12] "These issues have also opened opportunities for alternative processes for the production of propylene and butylenes."
[13] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets."
[14] "The use of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets."
[15] "The exploitation of shale gas for energy purposes and for the production of lower olefins is expected to increase dramatically in the years to come in spite of some environmental concerns related to its extraction (20) and the high costs involved in the production of shale gas."
[16] "The FTO process displays lower ethylene and propylene selectivities in comparison to MTO or DMTO."
[17] "However, FTO could be an attractive route to supply chemical complexes where the byproducts, i.e., C5+ and oxygenates, could be utilized."

The light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry due to their wide applications in various products. These chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the highest production volumes globally. Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of ethylene production, often from steam cracking of naphtha or recovery from refinery processes. The increasing demand for light olefins drives the search for alternative feedstocks and production methods, including coal, biomass, and natural gas. The rapid growth in energy demand and high oil prices have prompted reconsideration of coal usage as a feedstock. Biomass is encouraged due to its carbon-neutral nature. The recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S. has led to new possibilities for transforming natural gas into olefins, impacting the ethylene, propylene, and butadiene markets. This shift has created opportunities for alternative processes to produce these olefins. Despite environmental concerns and costs associated with shale gas extraction, the exploitation of this resource for energy and light olefin production is anticipated to increase significantly in the future. The Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) process, while offering feedstock flexibility, has lower selectivities for ethylene and propylene compared to methanol-to-olefins (MTO) or dimethyl ether-to-olefins (DMTO) processes. However, FTO could be advantageous in supplying chemical complexes where byproducts such as C5+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates can be utilized.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中扮演着至关重要的角色，因其在各种产品中的广泛应用。这些化学物质是全球产量最高的有机化学品之一。传统上，丙烯作为乙烷生产过程的副产品产生，通常是通过裂解石脑油或从炼油厂回收得到。对轻烯烃的需求增长推动了替代原料和生产工艺的探索，包括煤炭、生物质和天然气。能源需求的增长和高油价促使重新考虑煤炭作为原料的使用。由于其碳中性特性，生物质受到鼓励。美国最近发现的大量页岩气储备为天然气转化为烯烃提供了新机遇，影响了乙烯、丙烯和丁二烯市场。这一转变为生产这些烯烃开辟了新的途径。尽管页岩气开采存在环境问题和成本高昂，但预计未来利用这种资源进行能源和轻烯烃生产将显著增加。虽然费希尔-特罗普斯到烯烃（FTO）过程提供原料灵活性，但在选择性方面，与甲醇到烯烃（MTO）或二甲醚到烯烃（DMTO）过程相比，其对乙烯和丙烯的选择性较低。然而，对于能够利用副产品如C5+烃类和氧化物的化学综合体而言，FTO可能是一个有吸引力的途径。
