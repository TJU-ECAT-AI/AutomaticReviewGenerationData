[1] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000."

[2] "Approximately 95% of butadiene world production is a byproduct of the steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil for the production of ethylene and propylene."

[3] "The idea of following a direct route for the synthesis of lower olefins from synthesis gas has been considered for more than 50 years, and many references can be found in the literature about catalytic systems that might be suitable for this application."

[4] "The FTO process displays lower ethylene and propylene selectivities in comparison to MTO or DMTO. However, FTO could be an attractive route to supply chemical complexes where the byproducts, i.e., C5+ and oxygenates, could be utilized."

1. Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. They are used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in various industries such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride. Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide, ranking among the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000. Butadiene is often produced as a byproduct during the steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil for the production of ethylene and propylene.

2. Approximately 95% of the world's butadiene production comes as a byproduct of the steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil, which is used for the production of ethylene and propylene.

3. The direct synthesis of lower olefins from synthesis gas has been considered for over 50 years. There are numerous references in the literature regarding catalytic systems suitable for this application.

4. The Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) process, despite having lower selectivities for ethylene and propylene compared to methanol-to-olefins (MTO) or dimethyl ether-to-olefins (DMTO), could be an attractive option for supplying chemical complexes where the byproducts, such as C5+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates, can be utilized.

1. 乙烷、丙烯和丁烯是化学工业中的关键组成部分。它们被用于生产在各个行业中具有重要性的中间化学品，如乙基苯、乙烯氧化物和乙烯二氯化物。乙烷是世界上最大的化工产品，2000年在美国排名前30位的最高产量化学品中。丁二烯通常作为蒸汽裂解轻质石脑油和气体油生产乙烯和丙烯的副产品生产。

2. 大约95%的世界丁二烯产量来自于蒸汽裂解轻质石脑油和气体油生产乙烯和丙烯的副产品。

3. 直接从合成气合成低级烯烃的想法已经考虑了超过50年。文献中可以找到关于可能适合此应用的催化系统的大量参考。

4. 尽管费托到烯烃（FTO）过程相对于甲醇到烯烃（MTO）或二甲醚到烯烃（DMTO）具有较低的乙烯和丙烯选择性，但其对于供应可以利用副产品，例如C5+烃类和氧化合物的化学综合体而言，可能是一个有吸引力的选择。
