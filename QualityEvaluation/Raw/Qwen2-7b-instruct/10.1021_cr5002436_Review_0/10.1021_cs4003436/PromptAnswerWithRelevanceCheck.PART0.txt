[1] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000."
[2] "The major chemicals derived from ethylene and their derivatives are shown in Figure 1. Ethylene is mainly used by the plastics industry. In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for production of polyethylene in the Western European countries (Figure 2)."
[3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene."
[4] "The constant growth of demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012."
[5] "It is expected that new steam crackers will provide sufficient ethylene to meet the growing demand. Propylene production will increase as well; however, according to experts the production capacity will be insufficient to cover the demand."

The production of light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, is crucial for the chemical industry. They are used in a wide range of applications, from the production of plastics to intermediates for pharmaceuticals. Key production methods include steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which faces thermodynamic challenges such as temperature and pressure control. Longer alkane chains can be cracked into shorter olefins, which affects the yield and selectivity of the process. Demand for these olefins is expected to continue growing, with analysts predicting that production capacity will need to expand to meet the increasing demand. Ethylene, in particular, is used in the production of polyethylene, which makes up a significant portion of its consumption. Propylene, being more versatile, drives the demand for its production due to the growth in polypropylene consumption.

[2] "Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."
[3] "It is expected that new steam crackers will provide sufficient ethylene to meet the growing demand. Propylene production will increase as well; however, according to experts the production capacity will be insufficient to cover the demand."
[4] "The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values."
[5] "Researchers in the field use different ways to present their catalytic data. The product selectivity for iron-based catalysts is generally reported excluding CO2. Selectivity can be expressed based on weight (wt %: g of a product × 100/g of hydrocarbons), molar-based (moles of a product × 100/total moles of hydrocarbons) or carbon-based (% C: carbon atoms in a product × 100/total carbon atoms present in hydrocarbons)."
[6] "From Figure 9 it can be observed that selectivities to C2C4 olefins up to 75% were obtained using potassium-promoted catalyst. These catalysts were synthesized combining different promoters."
[7] "Promoted bulk catalysts could be considered as the most interesting option for FTO because of their high selectivity to light olefins, low methane production, low cost, and simple synthesis procedures."
[8] "In Figure 12 it is shown the FeMnK/Sil-2, FeMn/MgO, and the FeNaS catalysts prepared on inert supports displayed a high activity combined with high C2C4 olefins selectivity."

The light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry due to their wide applications in various products. These chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the highest production volumes globally. Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of ethylene production, often from steam cracking of naphtha or recovery from refinery processes. The increasing demand for light olefins drives the search for alternative feedstocks and production methods, including coal, biomass, and natural gas. The rapid growth in energy demand and high oil prices have prompted reconsideration of coal usage as a feedstock. Biomass is encouraged due to its carbon-neutral nature. The recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S. has led to new possibilities for transforming natural gas into olefins, impacting the ethylene, propylene, and butadiene markets. This shift has created opportunities for alternative processes to produce these olefins. Despite environmental concerns and costs associated with shale gas extraction, the exploitation of this resource for energy and light olefin production is anticipated to increase significantly in the future. The Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) process, while offering feedstock flexibility, has lower selectivities for ethylene and propylene compared to methanol-to-olefins (MTO) or dimethyl ether-to-olefins (DMTO) processes. However, FTO could be advantageous in supplying chemical complexes where byproducts such as C5+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates can be utilized.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中扮演着至关重要的角色，因其在各种产品中的广泛应用。这些化学物质是全球产量最高的有机化学品之一。传统上，丙烯作为乙烷生产过程的副产品产生，通常是通过裂解石脑油或从炼油厂回收得到。对轻烯烃的需求增长推动了替代原料和生产工艺的探索，包括煤炭、生物质和天然气。能源需求的增长和高油价促使重新考虑煤炭作为原料的使用。由于其碳中性特性，生物质受到鼓励。美国最近发现的大量页岩气储备为天然气转化为烯烃提供了新机遇，影响了乙烯、丙烯和丁二烯市场。这一转变为生产这些烯烃开辟了新的途径。尽管页岩气开采存在环境问题和成本高昂，但预计未来利用这种资源进行能源和轻烯烃生产将显著增加。虽然费希尔-特罗普斯到烯烃（FTO）过程提供原料灵活性，但在选择性方面，与甲醇到烯烃（MTO）或二甲醚到烯烃（DMTO）过程相比，其对乙烯和丙烯的选择性较低。然而，对于能够利用副产品如C5+烃类和氧化物的化学综合体而言，FTO可能是一个有吸引力的途径。
