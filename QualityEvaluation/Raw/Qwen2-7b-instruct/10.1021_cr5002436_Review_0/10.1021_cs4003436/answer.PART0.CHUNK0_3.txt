[1] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000."
[2] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or it is recovered from refinery processes, especially from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[3] "One of the most important applications of butadiene is in the fuel industry, accounting for approximately 85% of butylenes world production."
[4] "Approximately 95% of butadiene world production is a byproduct of the steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil for the production of ethylene and propylene."
[5] "With the recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S., (16, 17) new possibilities are open for the transformation of natural gas to olefins."
[6] "These processes are based on alternative feedstock such as coal, natural gas, or biomass."
[7] "With the recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S., (16, 17) new possibilities are open for the transformation of natural gas to olefins."
[8] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets."
[9] "The direct conversion of syngas into lower olefins via the FischerTropsch synthesis of the FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO) process is an interesting option compared to cracking of FT liquids, MTO, or DMTO."
