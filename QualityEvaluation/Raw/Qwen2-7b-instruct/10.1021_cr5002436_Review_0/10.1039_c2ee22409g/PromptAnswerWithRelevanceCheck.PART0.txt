<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a very demanding process due to the extensive utilization of butene or its products in the polymer industry.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in the production of plastics, rubbers, solvents, and numerous other chemical intermediates. They are also major contributors to the petrochemical industry, accounting for a significant portion of the market value. Key production methods for these olefins typically involve steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which can generate a variety of olefins, including ethylene, propylene, butene, and butadiene. However, this process is thermodynamically limited and energy-intensive, as it often requires high temperatures and consumes substantial amounts of energy. 

Olefin production through catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 offers several advantages over traditional steam cracking. These processes can reduce costs, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and optimize energy usage. They eliminate the need for furnaces, decoking shutdowns, and maintain lower operating temperatures. This leads to fewer material demands, less maintenance, and a higher proportion of the alkanes utilized in the olefin conversion process, thereby improving overall efficiency.

The dehydrogenation of n-butane is particularly challenging due to the high temperatures required for efficient butene production, which can also promote thermal cracking and coke formation, reducing yield and accelerating catalyst deactivation. Traditional oxygen-based dehydrogenation processes face selectivity issues, as n-butane can be over-oxidized to carbon dioxide. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane presents a promising solution to these problems.

Studies have shown that CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane can achieve high conversion rates, up to 81.84%, with selectivities for C2-C4 olefins in the range of 76-78%. Recent research has also highlighted the effectiveness of VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalysts in achieving 22.34% conversion of n-butane with a selectivity of 36.63% for C4 olefins. This demonstrates the potential of CO2 as an oxidant in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process for light alkanes.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们广泛用于塑料、橡胶、溶剂和其他化学中间体的生产。它们也是石油化学工业的主要贡献者，占市场价值的显著比例。关键的生产方法包括通过蒸汽裂解烃类产生多种烯烃，包括乙烷、丙烷、丁烯和丁二烯。然而，这种过程在热力学上有限且能耗高，因为它通常需要高温并消耗大量能量。

使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的催化脱氢化过程相对于传统的蒸汽裂解提供了几种优势。这些过程可以降低成本，减少温室气体排放，并优化能源使用。它们消除了对炉子、解焦停机的需求，并维持较低的操作温度。这导致材料需求更少、维护更少，并且在烷烃转化过程中使用更多的烷烃，从而提高整体效率。

丁烷的脱氢化特别具有挑战性，因为为了有效生成丁烯，通常需要较高的温度，这也可以促进热裂解和焦炭形成，降低产率并加速催化剂的降解。传统基于氧气的脱氢化过程面临选择性问题，因为丁烷可能会被过氧化为二氧化碳。将二氧化碳用作氧化剂在丁烷的氧化脱氢中提供了解决这些问题的有前景的方法。

研究表明，二氧化碳介导的氧化脱氢化可以达到高达81.84%的丁烷转化率，并具有C2-C4烯烃的选择性范围在76-78%。最近的研究还强调了VOx/SnO2ZrO2催化剂在实现22.34%丁烷转化与C4烯烃选择性36.63%的有效性。这表明二氧化碳作为氧化剂在提高轻烷烃脱氢过程的效率和选择性方面具有潜力。

Carbon dioxide has the highest heat capacity among other typical gases; moreover, it can minimize the hot spot phenomenon,15,16 which can cause prob- lems with regards to the operation of the reactor, such as temperature runaway, catalyst deactivation, undesired side reactions and the undesirable oxidation of products.17

The 
CO2
suppresses the unwanted total oxidation products due to its lower oxidizing ability26 and may also improve selectivity by poisoning the nonselective sites of the catalysts, which mainly contribute to the byproducts.27 

The activity may be stable when coking and decoking reach equilibrium; this was proved by the activation of the deactivated catalyst with CO2. 25

The
CO2
effect can be generalized as a gas-mediated modification of the catalyst surface and/or bulk composition, which affect the structural,electronic, acidbase, adsorption, diffusion and redox proper- ties.29 

The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 over iron supported on alkali or alkaline earth metals (Li, Na, Ca, Ba and K) impregnated on activated carbon. The highest yield of styrene (40.45%) with more than 90% selectivity with a specific activity of 2% was observed over a lithium-impregnated carbon support, which was comparatively higher than other alkali-impregnated supports. 

A comparison of the CO formation over VSb/Al and V/Al (Fig. 8) by pulse injection of CO2 revealed that the formation of CO is higher over VSb/Al, indicating a fast reoxidation process (eqn (10)) and suggesting that the increased mobility of oxygen in the redox catalyst can have a significant effect on the catalytic performance.

Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the perfor- mance of the catalyst. The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties.

The studies by Nakagawa et al. on the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide over Cr2O3 supported on oxidized diamond evidenced a synergy between the support and Cr2O3, which promoted the catalytic performance.

Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability.

The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place.

The utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalysis offers several benefits, including the potential for reducing CO2 levels while also enabling the production of chemicals in a more economical and environmentally friendly manner. It contributes to the mitigation of CO2 levels by providing a means to utilize this abundant and non-toxic gas in industrial processes, thereby reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and associated emissions. Economically and environmentally, CO2 can be harnessed as a feedstock for the synthesis of various chemicals, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional methods that often require high-energy inputs or the use of scarce resources.

The main challenges and barriers to the industrial scale implementation of carbon dioxide utilization in catalysis include difficulties in achieving high CO2 conversions with minimal catalyst deactivation, improving catalyst performance per pass, and ensuring thermal stability over extended periods. Solutions include developing more efficient catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and exploring novel activation mechanisms for CO2. Advancements in this field could involve refining catalyst design, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 activation, and integrating CO2 utilization with existing industrial processes to maximize economic benefits.

Behavior of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalytic transformations emerges from its unique properties, such as its high heat capacity, low reactivity, and ability to serve as an oxidizing agent under certain conditions. Key aspects of its activation and conversion are studied to understand how it interacts with catalyst surfaces, facilitates oxidation reactions, and affects the reactivity and stability of catalysts. Activators like alkali metals can promote CO2 activation, enhancing catalytic performance by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms to substrates. The surface/lattice oxygen species play crucial roles in oxidative reactions by donating oxygen for abstraction of hydrogen and reoxidizing catalysts, maintaining their functionality.

As a promoter, carbon dioxide affects the kinetics, conversions, selectivities, and product distributions in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems. It can modify catalyst surfaces and bulk compositions, influencing structural, electronic, acid-base, adsorption, diffusion, and redox properties. This leads to changes in reaction mechanisms, catalytic activity, and product yields, enabling more efficient and selective conversions.

In terms of current statuses and future perspectives, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter holds promise for transforming industrial processes, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative coupling of methane. Advances in catalyst development, optimization of process conditions, and integration with existing industries aim to address the challenges of high CO2 conversions, minimal coke deposition, and improved catalytic performance. The potential for cost savings, energy efficiency, and CO2 reduction makes this area of research increasingly relevant for the chemical industry and the broader effort to mitigate climate change.
