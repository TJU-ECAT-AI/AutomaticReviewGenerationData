<p>Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic58 and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields.</p>
<p>The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct (eqn (19)).</p>
<p>In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy.</p>
<p>Moreover, capital and operational efficiencies are gained by eliminating the need for a furnace,decoking shutdowns,lower operating temperatures,fewer material demands, fewer maintenance operations and the use of a greater proportion of the alkanes in the olefin conversion process.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a very demanding process due to the extensive utilization of butene or its products in the polymer industry. The dehydrogenation of n-butane is an equilibrium endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperatures to obtain high yields of butene. However, the high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to lower alkanes and coke, resulting in a decline of the product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide. The answer to this problem may be oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2.</p>
<p>Very few studies have been reported in the literature for the ODH of n-butane where CO2 is used as an oxidant. The oxidative dehydrogenation of C4H10 with CO2 was investigated by Krylov et al. over a CrMnLaV/Al2O3 catalyst and the conversion of C4H10 was found to be 8184% with selectivity for C2C4 in the range of 7678% at 630650 C.</p>
<p>Recently, Park et al. investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane with CO2 over VOx/SnO2ZrO2, which exhibited excellent performance with 22.34% conversion of n-butane with 36.63% selectivity for the C4 olefins.</p>

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in the production of plastics, rubbers, solvents, and numerous other chemical intermediates. They are also major contributors to the petrochemical industry, accounting for a significant portion of the market value. Key production methods for these olefins typically involve steam cracking of hydrocarbons, which can generate a variety of olefins, including ethylene, propylene, butene, and butadiene. However, this process is thermodynamically limited and energy-intensive, as it often requires high temperatures and consumes substantial amounts of energy. 

Olefin production through catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 offers several advantages over traditional steam cracking. These processes can reduce costs, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and optimize energy usage. They eliminate the need for furnaces, decoking shutdowns, and maintain lower operating temperatures. This leads to fewer material demands, less maintenance, and a higher proportion of the alkanes utilized in the olefin conversion process, thereby improving overall efficiency.

The dehydrogenation of n-butane is particularly challenging due to the high temperatures required for efficient butene production, which can also promote thermal cracking and coke formation, reducing yield and accelerating catalyst deactivation. Traditional oxygen-based dehydrogenation processes face selectivity issues, as n-butane can be over-oxidized to carbon dioxide. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane presents a promising solution to these problems.

Studies have shown that CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane can achieve high conversion rates, up to 81.84%, with selectivities for C2-C4 olefins in the range of 76-78%. Recent research has also highlighted the effectiveness of VOx/SnO2ZrO2 catalysts in achieving 22.34% conversion of n-butane with a selectivity of 36.63% for C4 olefins. This demonstrates the potential of CO2 as an oxidant in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process for light alkanes.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们广泛用于塑料、橡胶、溶剂和其他化学中间体的生产。它们也是石油化学工业的主要贡献者，占市场价值的显著比例。关键的生产方法包括通过蒸汽裂解烃类产生多种烯烃，包括乙烷、丙烷、丁烯和丁二烯。然而，这种过程在热力学上有限且能耗高，因为它通常需要高温并消耗大量能量。

使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的催化脱氢化过程相对于传统的蒸汽裂解提供了几种优势。这些过程可以降低成本，减少温室气体排放，并优化能源使用。它们消除了对炉子、解焦停机的需求，并维持较低的操作温度。这导致材料需求更少、维护更少，并且在烷烃转化过程中使用更多的烷烃，从而提高整体效率。

丁烷的脱氢化特别具有挑战性，因为为了有效生成丁烯，通常需要较高的温度，这也可以促进热裂解和焦炭形成，降低产率并加速催化剂的降解。传统基于氧气的脱氢化过程面临选择性问题，因为丁烷可能会被过氧化为二氧化碳。将二氧化碳用作氧化剂在丁烷的氧化脱氢中提供了解决这些问题的有前景的方法。

研究表明，二氧化碳介导的氧化脱氢化可以达到高达81.84%的丁烷转化率，并具有C2-C4烯烃的选择性范围在76-78%。最近的研究还强调了VOx/SnO2ZrO2催化剂在实现22.34%丁烷转化与C4烯烃选择性36.63%的有效性。这表明二氧化碳作为氧化剂在提高轻烷烃脱氢过程的效率和选择性方面具有潜力。
