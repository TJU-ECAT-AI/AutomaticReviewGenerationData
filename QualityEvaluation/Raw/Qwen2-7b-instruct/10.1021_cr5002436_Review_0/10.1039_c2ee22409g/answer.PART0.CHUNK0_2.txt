[1] "Among the ODH of alkyl aromatics, ethyl benzene (EB) holds significant attention owing to the importance of its product, styrene, which is a very important monomer for synthetic rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) resins and polystyrene."
[2] "In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene (EB) to styrene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which exhibited superior conversions compared with that of a simple dehy- drogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere."
[4] "The present challenges for the industrial applications of this technology involve process feasibility studies, catalyst processing, reaction engineering, improvement of carbon dioxide conversions, reactor design to decrease energy consumption and the development of catalysts with appropriate CO2 promoters."
[5] "The process involves the use of a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst and the operation condition is 560 C. The process can be run by the direct utilization of CO2, which may be obtained as by- product from petrochemical oxidation or the reforming industry."

The light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry due to their wide applications in synthetic rubber, ABS resins, and polystyrene. The conventional steam-cracking method for dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins is costly and energy-intensive. The use of CO2 in catalytic dehydrogenation processes can significantly reduce costs, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve energy. Ethyl benzene dehydrogenation to styrene has been studied successfully, demonstrating the potential of CO2 as a soft oxidant. Industrial applications face challenges including process optimization, catalyst improvement, reaction engineering, energy efficiency enhancement, and the development of CO2-promoted catalysts. The process utilizes a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst at 560°C, enabling direct CO2 usage sourced from petrochemical oxidation or reforming industries.
