Carbon dioxide has the highest heat capacity among other typical gases; moreover, it can minimize the hot spot phenomenon,15,16 which can cause prob- lems with regards to the operation of the reactor, such as temperature runaway, catalyst deactivation, undesired side reactions and the undesirable oxidation of products.17

The 
CO2
suppresses the unwanted total oxidation products due to its lower oxidizing ability26 and may also improve selectivity by poisoning the nonselective sites of the catalysts, which mainly contribute to the byproducts.27 

The activity may be stable when coking and decoking reach equilibrium; this was proved by the activation of the deactivated catalyst with CO2. 25

The
CO2
effect can be generalized as a gas-mediated modification of the catalyst surface and/or bulk composition, which affect the structural,electronic, acidbase, adsorption, diffusion and redox proper- ties.29 

The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene with CO2 over iron supported on alkali or alkaline earth metals (Li, Na, Ca, Ba and K) impregnated on activated carbon. The highest yield of styrene (40.45%) with more than 90% selectivity with a specific activity of 2% was observed over a lithium-impregnated carbon support, which was comparatively higher than other alkali-impregnated supports. 

A comparison of the CO formation over VSb/Al and V/Al (Fig. 8) by pulse injection of CO2 revealed that the formation of CO is higher over VSb/Al, indicating a fast reoxidation process (eqn (10)) and suggesting that the increased mobility of oxygen in the redox catalyst can have a significant effect on the catalytic performance.

Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the perfor- mance of the catalyst. The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties.

The studies by Nakagawa et al. on the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide over Cr2O3 supported on oxidized diamond evidenced a synergy between the support and Cr2O3, which promoted the catalytic performance.

Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability.

The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place.

The utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalysis offers several benefits, including the potential for reducing CO2 levels while also enabling the production of chemicals in a more economical and environmentally friendly manner. It contributes to the mitigation of CO2 levels by providing a means to utilize this abundant and non-toxic gas in industrial processes, thereby reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and associated emissions. Economically and environmentally, CO2 can be harnessed as a feedstock for the synthesis of various chemicals, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional methods that often require high-energy inputs or the use of scarce resources.

The main challenges and barriers to the industrial scale implementation of carbon dioxide utilization in catalysis include difficulties in achieving high CO2 conversions with minimal catalyst deactivation, improving catalyst performance per pass, and ensuring thermal stability over extended periods. Solutions include developing more efficient catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and exploring novel activation mechanisms for CO2. Advancements in this field could involve refining catalyst design, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 activation, and integrating CO2 utilization with existing industrial processes to maximize economic benefits.

Behavior of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalytic transformations emerges from its unique properties, such as its high heat capacity, low reactivity, and ability to serve as an oxidizing agent under certain conditions. Key aspects of its activation and conversion are studied to understand how it interacts with catalyst surfaces, facilitates oxidation reactions, and affects the reactivity and stability of catalysts. Activators like alkali metals can promote CO2 activation, enhancing catalytic performance by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms to substrates. The surface/lattice oxygen species play crucial roles in oxidative reactions by donating oxygen for abstraction of hydrogen and reoxidizing catalysts, maintaining their functionality.

As a promoter, carbon dioxide affects the kinetics, conversions, selectivities, and product distributions in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems. It can modify catalyst surfaces and bulk compositions, influencing structural, electronic, acid-base, adsorption, diffusion, and redox properties. This leads to changes in reaction mechanisms, catalytic activity, and product yields, enabling more efficient and selective conversions.

In terms of current statuses and future perspectives, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter holds promise for transforming industrial processes, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative coupling of methane. Advances in catalyst development, optimization of process conditions, and integration with existing industries aim to address the challenges of high CO2 conversions, minimal coke deposition, and improved catalytic performance. The potential for cost savings, energy efficiency, and CO2 reduction makes this area of research increasingly relevant for the chemical industry and the broader effort to mitigate climate change.
