[1] "Propylene and ethylene are the second most important starting products in the petrochemical industry after ethylene."
[2] "There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non- oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of n-butane is an equilibrium endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperatures to obtain high yields of butene."
[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 over catalytic systems will not only proceed in a completely oxidative manner, but also partially by a simple dehydrogenation."
[6] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene (EB) holds significant attention owing to the importance of its product, styrene, which is a very important monomer for synthetic rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) resins and polystyrene."

The light olefins propylene and ethylene are crucial in the chemical industry, serving as foundational materials for numerous applications and markets. They are synthesized through a variety of methods including olefin metathesis, methanol-to-propene conversion, and olefin cracking. The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes presents an appealing method to produce alkenes due to its exothermic nature and the avoidance of thermodynamic constraints typically encountered in non-oxidative synthesis. However, this process often faces challenges related to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. For instance, the dehydrogenation of n-butane is an equilibrium reaction that requires high temperatures to efficiently convert to butene. Moreover, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 involves a complex interplay between complete oxidation and simple dehydrogenation, influenced by factors like catalyst choice and process conditions. The dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene, driven by the importance of styrene in manufacturing synthetic rubber, ABS resins, and polystyrene, highlights the ongoing efforts to optimize synthesis methods and overcome thermodynamic challenges.

丙烯和乙烯在石油化工行业中是最重要的基础产品之一，广泛应用于各种应用和市场。它们通过多种方法合成，包括共轭双烯合成、甲醇到丙烯转换和共轭二烯裂解等。轻烷烃的氧化脱氢提供了一种有吸引力的途径来制备烯烃，由于该反应是放热的，并且通过生成水作为副产物，避免了非氧化路线的热力学约束。然而，这个过程经常面临与温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的挑战。例如，丁烷的脱氢化是一个平衡反应，需要高温才能有效地转化为丁烯。此外，乙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢涉及复杂的过程，其中包括完全氧化和简单脱氢的相互作用，这些都受到催化剂选择和工艺条件的影响。将乙基苯脱氢为苯乙烯，考虑到苯乙烯在制造合成橡胶、ABS树脂和聚苯乙烯中的重要性，突显了优化合成方法和克服热力学挑战的持续努力。
