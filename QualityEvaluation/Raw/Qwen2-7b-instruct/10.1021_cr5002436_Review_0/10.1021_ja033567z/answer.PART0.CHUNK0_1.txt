The Handbook of Aqueous Solubility Data contains comprehensive information on solubilities of over 4000 organic compounds, covering areas such as pharmaceuticals, pollutants, nutrients, herbicides, pesticides, agricultural, industrial, and energy-related compounds. Each compound is meticulously identified by its molecular formula, name, synonyms, molecular weight, CAS Registry Number, melting point, and boiling point, if available. Additionally, a qualitative assessment is provided through a five-point rating system that evaluates the quality of the data in terms of temperature, purity of solute, equilibration time, analysis, and accuracy/precision.
