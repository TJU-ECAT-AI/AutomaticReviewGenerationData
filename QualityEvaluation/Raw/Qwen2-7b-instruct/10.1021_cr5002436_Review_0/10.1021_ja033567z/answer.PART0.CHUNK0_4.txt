The Handbook of Aqueous Solubility Data contains extensive information on solubilities for over 4000 organic compounds, covering various fields such as pharmaceuticals, pollutants, nutrients, herbicides, pesticides, agriculture, industry, and energy-related substances. Each compound is identified through its molecular formula, name, synonyms, molecular weight, CAS Registry Number, melting point, and boiling point (if available). Additionally, a five-point rating system evaluates the quality of the reporting regarding temperature, purity of solute, equilibration time/agitation, analysis, and accuracy/precision.
