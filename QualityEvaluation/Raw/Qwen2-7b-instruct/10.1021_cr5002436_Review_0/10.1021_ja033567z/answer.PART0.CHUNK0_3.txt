The Handbook of Aqueous Solubility Data contains comprehensive information on solubilities for a wide range of organic compounds, encompassing pharmaceuticals, pollutants, nutrients, herbicides, pesticides, agricultural, industrial, and energy-related compounds. Each compound is meticulously identified through its molecular formula, name, synonyms, molecular weight, CAS Registry Number, melting point, and boiling point (when available). Additionally, a qualitative assessment of the reporting quality is provided through a five-point rating system, focusing on factors such as temperature, purity of solute, equilibration time, analysis method, and accuracy/precision.
