The Handbook of Aqueous Solubility Data compiles over 16,000 records on solubilities for more than 4,000 organic compounds, encompassing various categories such as pharmaceuticals, pollutants, nutrients, herbicides, pesticides, agricultural, industrial, and energy-related substances. Each compound is meticulously identified through its molecular formula, name, synonyms, molecular weight, CAS Registry Number, melting point, and boiling point (when applicable). Additionally, a qualitative assessment is provided for each entry, evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the reported data across factors including temperature, solute purity, equilibration time and agitation, analysis method, and overall accuracy or precision.
