[1] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes."
[2] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
[3] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
[4] "When two CH bonds of neighbouring carbons are split, a double bond is formed and alkanes are converted to alkenes."
[5] "However, when the two CH bonds belong to non-neighboring carbon atoms, dehydorcyclization and possibly also aromatization may occur."
[6] "Thermodynamics show that aromatization equilibria overtake dehydrogenation equilibria at higher temperatures."
[7] "In all these industrial processes, the heat obtained from the burning of coke is used in the dehydrogenation step."
[8] "Since the discovery of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have done extensive research to develop a commercial dehydrogenation process."
[9] "In the worldwide CATOFIN1 process, licensed by UCI-ABB Lummus Global, series of adiabatic fixed bed reactors are in cyclic operation with quickly alternating dehydrogenating and regeneration periods."
[10] "In situ capabilities have only recently become commercially available, and as a consequence, only a limited number of in situ characterization studies are available in the literature."

The dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process that requires high temperatures and low pressures to produce significant amounts of alkenes. The process is generally unselective, converting all equivalent CH bonds equally. At higher temperatures, aromatization reactions can occur, leading to the formation of compounds like benzene and toluene. Industrial processes, such as the CATOFIN1 process, use the heat generated from burning coke to facilitate the dehydrogenation. Recently, in situ characterization techniques, like Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, have enabled researchers to monitor surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenation, providing insights into the active sites on the catalyst.

烷烃脱氢是一个吸热过程，需要较高的温度和较低的压力来获得显著的烯烃产量。该过程通常是非选择性的，等效的CH键以相同的机会反应。在较高温度下，芳香化反应可能会发生，导致苯、甲苯等化合物的形成。工业过程中，如CATOFIN1工艺，利用燃烧焦产生的热量来促进脱氢。最近，原位表征技术，如拉曼光谱和漫反射光谱，使研究人员能够监测催化剂表面的铬物种在烷烃脱氢过程中的变化，从而提供了关于活性位点的见解。
