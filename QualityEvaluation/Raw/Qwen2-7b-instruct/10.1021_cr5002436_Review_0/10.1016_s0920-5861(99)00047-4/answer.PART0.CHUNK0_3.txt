[1] "Alkane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts in the absence of oxygen is of high interest for the industrial production of propene and isobutene."
[2] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas iso- butene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."
[3] "CATO-FIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively."
[4] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, requiring relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes."
[5] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
[6] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
[7] "As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions."
[8] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."
[9] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mciver [6], and by Kearby [7]."
[10] "Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts [850]."
[11] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selecitivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."
[12] "In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts."
[13] "Dehydrogenation reactions are rather unselective, because all equivalent CH bonds have an equal bonding energy, and therefore an equal chance of reacting."
[14] "When two CH bonds of neighboring carbons are split, a double bond is formed and alkanes are converted to alkenes."
[15] "However, when the two CH bonds belong to non-neighboring carbon atoms, dehydrocyclization and possibly also aromatization may occur."
[16] "Thermodynamics show that aromatization equilibria overtake dehydrogenation equilibria at higher temperatures."
[17] "Thus, n-hexane is primarily converted to benzene, whereas toluene can be made from n-heptane."
[18] "If the two CH bonds are part of two different alkane molecules, higher molecular-weight hydrocarbons are formed, and extensive CH bond breaking and CC bond formation may lead to hydrogen gas and coke."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry. Propylene is essential for synthesizing high-purity polypropylene, which is used in various polymer applications. Isobutene is vital for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, key additives in gasoline production. The CATO-FIN1 process leads the global production of propene and isobutene, with capacities reaching 600,000 and 2,600,000 metric tons annually, respectively. This highlights the high demand for these light olefins in the market. 

2. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires high temperatures and low pressures to generate significant yields of alkenes. Due to the equal chance of all equivalent CH bonds reacting, dehydrogenation reactions are generally non-selective. Higher temperatures favor thermal cracking to lighter alkanes and the formation of coke. Therefore, effective catalysts must exhibit not only high activity and selectivity but also the ability to suppress thermal cracking reactions.

3. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, have proven superior in alkane dehydrogenation processes. They are widely utilized in commercial applications. Studies focusing on identifying active sites, understanding the influence of preparation and treatment conditions on catalyst properties, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism have been conducted extensively. 

4. The unselectivity of dehydrogenation reactions arises from the equal bonding energy of all equivalent CH bonds, allowing for a uniform probability of reaction. When two CH bonds of neighboring carbons are split, they form a double bond, converting the alkane to an alkene. Conversely, when the CH bonds belong to non-neighboring atoms, dehydrocyclization and potential aromatization may occur.

5. Thermodynamics dictate that at higher temperatures, aromatization equilibria surpass dehydrogenation equilibria. For instance, n-hexane is predominantly converted to benzene, while toluene can be derived from n-heptane. If the two CH bonds are part of different alkane molecules, the formation of higher molecular-weight hydrocarbons and the creation of hydrogen gas and coke may ensue.

6. To achieve acceptable activity and selectivity in a single pass, the catalyst must be periodically regenerated through coke burning. Additionally, proper selection of feed rates and temperatures is essential for achieving an optimal industrial dehydrogenation process with the required selectivity.

1. 丙烯和异丁烯等轻烯烃在化工行业中起着关键作用。丙烯用于合成高纯度聚丙烯，广泛应用于多种聚合物应用。异丁烯是MTBE和ETBE的原料，它们是汽油添加剂的关键成分。CATO-FIN1工艺在全球范围内主导着丙烯和异丁烯的生产，每年产能分别达到60万吨和2600万吨，这凸显了这些轻烯烃在市场上的高需求。

2. 通过加热和低压操作，烷烃脱氢生成乙烯的过程是吸热的。为了获得大量烯烃，需要较高的温度和较低的压力。由于所有等效的CH键具有相同的结合能，因此脱氢反应通常是非选择性的。高温有利于轻烷烃的裂解和焦炭的形成。因此，有效的催化剂不仅需要表现出高活性和选择性，还需要抑制热裂解反应。

3. 支持的铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是Cr2O3/Al2O3，在烷烃脱氢过程中表现优异，并且被广泛用作商业催化剂。对活性位点的识别、准备和处理条件对催化剂性质的影响以及催化活性/选择性的研究已进行了深入探讨。此外，还致力于阐明脱氢机制。

4. 脱氢反应的非选择性源于所有等效的CH键具有相同的结合能，允许均匀的概率反应。当两个相邻碳原子的CH键断裂时，它们会形成双键，将烷烃转化为烯烃。相反，当CH键属于非相邻原子时，脱氢环化和潜在的芳香化也可能发生。

5. 热力学表明，在较高温度下，芳香化平衡超过脱氢平衡。例如，己烷主要转化为苯，而庚烷可以转化为甲苯。如果两个CH键属于不同的烷烃分子，则可能形成更高分子量的碳氢化合物，并可能导致氢气和焦炭的生成。

6. 为了实现单次通过过程中的可接受的活性和选择性，催化剂需要通过燃烧沉积的焦炭进行周期性再生。此外，正确选择进料速率和温度对于实现具有所需选择性的最优工业脱氢过程至关重要。
