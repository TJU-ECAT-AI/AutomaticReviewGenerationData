[1] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes."
[2] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
[3] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
[4] "When two CH bonds of neighbouring carbons are split, a double bond is formed and alkanes are converted to alkenes."
[5] "However, when the two CH bonds belong to non-neighboring carbon atoms, dehydorcyclization and possibly also aromatization may occur."
[6] "Thermodynamics show that aromatization equilibria overtake dehydrogenation equilibria at higher temperatures."
[7] "In all these industrial processes, the heat obtained from the burning of coke is used in the dehydrogenation step."
[8] "Since the discovery of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial companies have done extensive research to develop a commercial dehydrogenation process."
[9] "In the worldwide CATOFIN1 process, licensed by UCI-ABB Lummus Global, series of adiabatic fixed bed reactors are in cyclic operation with quickly alternating dehydrogenating and regeneration periods."

The dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process that requires high temperatures and low pressures to produce significant amounts of alkenes. The process is generally unselective, converting all equivalent CH bonds equally. At higher temperatures, aromatization reactions can occur, leading to the formation of compounds like benzene and toluene. Industrial processes, such as the CATOFIN1 process, use the heat generated from burning coke to facilitate the dehydrogenation. Recently, in situ characterization techniques, like Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, have enabled researchers to monitor surface chromium species during alkane dehydrogenation, providing insights into the active sites on the catalyst.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry due to their applications in various sectors including polymer production, fuel additives, and others. Propene is utilized for synthesizing high-purity polypropylene, while isobutene is essential for creating MTBE and ETBE, which are gasoline additives. The CATO-FIN1 process is globally recognized for its efficiency in producing propene and isobutene, with capacities of 600,000 and 2,600,000 metric tons annually, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the global MTBE production stems from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane.

Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that necessitates high temperatures and low pressures to yield significant quantities of alkenes. This reaction tends to be unselective, as all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have equal chances of reacting. High temperatures also promote thermal cracking reactions, which convert lighter alkanes and produce coke. To meet the demands of the industry, catalysts must exhibit not only high activity and selectivity but also effectively inhibit thermal cracking reactions. Since the groundbreaking work of Frey and Huppke, the superiority of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been acknowledged. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those on aluminum oxide (Cr2O3/Al2O3), are commonly used commercially.

In modern studies, researchers concentrate on identifying active sites, understanding how preparation and treatment conditions affect chromium oxide speciation and catalytic activity, and unraveling the dehydrogenation mechanism. In industrial processes, the heat generated from burning coke is harnessed for the dehydrogenation step.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中起着至关重要的作用，因为它们在多个领域都有应用，包括聚合物生产、燃料添加剂等。丙烯用于合成高纯度聚丙烯，而异丁烯则用于制造MTBE和ETBE，这些是汽油添加剂。CATO-FIN1过程因其在生产丙烯和异丁烯方面的高效性而广受认可，每年的生产能力分别为60万吨和260万吨。估计全球25%的MTBE产量来源于异丁烷的催化脱氢反应。

烷基化脱氢是一个吸热过程，需要较高的温度和较低的压力来获得大量双烯。由于所有烷基化分子中的等效CH键有相同的反应机会，脱氢反应通常是非选择性的。高温还促进较轻烷烃的裂解反应以及焦炭的生成。为了满足行业需求，催化剂不仅需要具有良好的活性和选择性，还需要抑制裂解反应。自Frey和Huppke的开创性工作以来，人们已经认识到支持型铬氧化物催化剂在烷基化脱氢方面的优越性能。特别是铝氧化物（Cr2O3/Al2O3）上的铬氧化物催化剂被广泛用作商用催化剂。

现代研究主要集中在识别活性位点、理解制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种化的影响以及催化活性/选择性，并阐明脱氢机制。在工业过程中，通过燃烧焦炭产生的热量用于脱氢步骤。

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry due to their applications in polymer synthesis, as well as in the production of various chemical intermediates. Their market trends are closely tied to global demand for plastics, packaging materials, and fuel additives. The synthesis of these olefins involves endothermic alkane dehydrogenation reactions, which are temperature-sensitive and require high temperatures and low pressures to achieve significant yields of alkenes. Longer alkane chains tend to be dehydrogenated at lower temperatures compared to lighter alkanes, illustrating the thermodynamic constraints of these processes.

2. The production of propene and isobutene through alkane dehydrogenation has significant industrial impact. The CATO-FIN1 process, for instance, is a prominent method for producing these olefins globally, with capacities reaching up to 600,000 and 2,600,000 metric tons per year for propene and isobutene, respectively. The increasing demand for isobutene in the synthesis of MTBE, a gasoline additive, indicates the growing importance of this process.

3. During the 1970s to 1980s, the focus was on catalytic dehydrogenation of n-butane to produce butene and butadiene, which served as precursors for synthetic rubber manufacturing. The transition towards the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane reflects changes in market demands and technological advancements in the chemical industry.

4. It is estimated that 25% of the global MTBE production stems from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. This number is anticipated to rise in the future, given the constraints on traditional sources of isobutene, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and the growing demand for isobutene in the MTBE market.

5. Alkane dehydrogenation processes are characterized by their endothermic nature, requiring elevated temperatures and low pressures to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes. The selectivity and activity of the catalysts play a pivotal role in achieving desired product yields and minimizing thermal cracking reactions.

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry. Propylene is essential for synthesizing high-purity polypropylene, which is used in various polymer applications. Isobutene is vital for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, key additives in gasoline production. The CATO-FIN1 process leads the global production of propene and isobutene, with capacities reaching 600,000 and 2,600,000 metric tons annually, respectively. This highlights the high demand for these light olefins in the market. 

2. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires high temperatures and low pressures to generate significant yields of alkenes. Due to the equal chance of all equivalent CH bonds reacting, dehydrogenation reactions are generally non-selective. Higher temperatures favor thermal cracking to lighter alkanes and the formation of coke. Therefore, effective catalysts must exhibit not only high activity and selectivity but also the ability to suppress thermal cracking reactions.

3. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, have proven superior in alkane dehydrogenation processes. They are widely utilized in commercial applications. Studies focusing on identifying active sites, understanding the influence of preparation and treatment conditions on catalyst properties, and elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism have been conducted extensively. 

4. The unselectivity of dehydrogenation reactions arises from the equal bonding energy of all equivalent CH bonds, allowing for a uniform probability of reaction. When two CH bonds of neighboring carbons are split, they form a double bond, converting the alkane to an alkene. Conversely, when the CH bonds belong to non-neighboring atoms, dehydrocyclization and potential aromatization may occur.

5. Thermodynamics dictate that at higher temperatures, aromatization equilibria surpass dehydrogenation equilibria. For instance, n-hexane is predominantly converted to benzene, while toluene can be derived from n-heptane. If the two CH bonds are part of different alkane molecules, the formation of higher molecular-weight hydrocarbons and the creation of hydrogen gas and coke may ensue.

6. To achieve acceptable activity and selectivity in a single pass, the catalyst must be periodically regenerated through coke burning. Additionally, proper selection of feed rates and temperatures is essential for achieving an optimal industrial dehydrogenation process with the required selectivity.

1. 丙烯和异丁烯等轻烯烃在化工行业中起着关键作用。丙烯用于合成高纯度聚丙烯，广泛应用于多种聚合物应用。异丁烯是MTBE和ETBE的原料，它们是汽油添加剂的关键成分。CATO-FIN1工艺在全球范围内主导着丙烯和异丁烯的生产，每年产能分别达到60万吨和2600万吨，这凸显了这些轻烯烃在市场上的高需求。

2. 通过加热和低压操作，烷烃脱氢生成乙烯的过程是吸热的。为了获得大量烯烃，需要较高的温度和较低的压力。由于所有等效的CH键具有相同的结合能，因此脱氢反应通常是非选择性的。高温有利于轻烷烃的裂解和焦炭的形成。因此，有效的催化剂不仅需要表现出高活性和选择性，还需要抑制热裂解反应。

3. 支持的铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是Cr2O3/Al2O3，在烷烃脱氢过程中表现优异，并且被广泛用作商业催化剂。对活性位点的识别、准备和处理条件对催化剂性质的影响以及催化活性/选择性的研究已进行了深入探讨。此外，还致力于阐明脱氢机制。

4. 脱氢反应的非选择性源于所有等效的CH键具有相同的结合能，允许均匀的概率反应。当两个相邻碳原子的CH键断裂时，它们会形成双键，将烷烃转化为烯烃。相反，当CH键属于非相邻原子时，脱氢环化和潜在的芳香化也可能发生。

5. 热力学表明，在较高温度下，芳香化平衡超过脱氢平衡。例如，己烷主要转化为苯，而庚烷可以转化为甲苯。如果两个CH键属于不同的烷烃分子，则可能形成更高分子量的碳氢化合物，并可能导致氢气和焦炭的生成。

6. 为了实现单次通过过程中的可接受的活性和选择性，催化剂需要通过燃烧沉积的焦炭进行周期性再生。此外，正确选择进料速率和温度对于实现具有所需选择性的最优工业脱氢过程至关重要。
