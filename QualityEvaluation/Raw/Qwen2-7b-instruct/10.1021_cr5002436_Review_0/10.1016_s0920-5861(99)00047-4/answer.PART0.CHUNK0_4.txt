[1] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas iso- butene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."
[2] "It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane."
[3] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They are used in the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene in the polymer industry and as additives in gasoline through the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE. It is estimated that 25% of the global production of MTBE comes from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. These olefins are essential due to their wide applications in various industries.

2. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce light olefins involves endothermic reactions that require high temperatures and low pressures to achieve significant yields. The unselectivity of these reactions stems from the equal bonding energies of all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule, leading to a similar likelihood of reacting to form alkenes, but also potentially forming lighter alkanes and coke.

3. Suitable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation must exhibit high activity and selectivity to prevent the formation of unwanted products. These catalysts must also suppress thermal cracking reactions, which are favored at high temperatures, to maintain the desired product distribution and yield.

4. The pioneering work of Frey and Huppke established the superiority of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, are widely used commercially due to their effective performance in this process.

5. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, with a particular emphasis on industrially utilized Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中至关重要。它们用于聚合物工业中高纯度聚丙烯的合成，以及作为汽油添加剂通过MTBE和ETBE的合成。估计全球约有25%的MTBE生产来源于异丁烷的催化脱氢。这些烯烃因其在各行业中的广泛应用而不可或缺。

2. 醇脱氢反应产生轻烯烃需要高温和低压条件以获得显著的产率。由于所有烷烃分子中等价的CH键具有相同的结合能，导致脱氢反应的非选择性，使得所有CH键具有相等的反应可能性，形成烯烃，同时也可能形成更轻的烷烃和焦炭。

3. 适合的醇脱氢催化剂不仅需要具备高活性和选择性，以防止形成不需要的产品，还需要抑制在高温下有利于发生裂解反应和焦炭生成的热裂解反应，以保持所需的产物分布和产率。

4. Frey和Huppke的开创性工作确立了支持型铬氧化物催化剂在醇脱氢反应中的优越性能。特别是Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂，由于其在这一过程中的有效表现，被广泛用作商业催化剂。

5. 本综述提供了当前对基于铬的脱氢催化剂的理解概览，特别关注了工业上使用的Cr/Al2O3催化剂。
