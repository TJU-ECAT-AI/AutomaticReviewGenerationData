Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play crucial roles in the chemical industry due to their applications in various sectors including polymer production, fuel additives, and others. Propene is utilized for synthesizing high-purity polypropylene, while isobutene is essential for creating MTBE and ETBE, which are gasoline additives. The CATO-FIN1 process is globally recognized for its efficiency in producing propene and isobutene, with capacities of 600,000 and 2,600,000 metric tons annually, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the global MTBE production stems from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane.

Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that necessitates high temperatures and low pressures to yield significant quantities of alkenes. This reaction tends to be unselective, as all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have equal chances of reacting. High temperatures also promote thermal cracking reactions, which convert lighter alkanes and produce coke. To meet the demands of the industry, catalysts must exhibit not only high activity and selectivity but also effectively inhibit thermal cracking reactions. Since the groundbreaking work of Frey and Huppke, the superiority of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been acknowledged. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those on aluminum oxide (Cr2O3/Al2O3), are commonly used commercially.

In modern studies, researchers concentrate on identifying active sites, understanding how preparation and treatment conditions affect chromium oxide speciation and catalytic activity, and unraveling the dehydrogenation mechanism. In industrial processes, the heat generated from burning coke is harnessed for the dehydrogenation step.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中起着至关重要的作用，因为它们在多个领域都有应用，包括聚合物生产、燃料添加剂等。丙烯用于合成高纯度聚丙烯，而异丁烯则用于制造MTBE和ETBE，这些是汽油添加剂。CATO-FIN1过程因其在生产丙烯和异丁烯方面的高效性而广受认可，每年的生产能力分别为60万吨和260万吨。估计全球25%的MTBE产量来源于异丁烷的催化脱氢反应。

烷基化脱氢是一个吸热过程，需要较高的温度和较低的压力来获得大量双烯。由于所有烷基化分子中的等效CH键有相同的反应机会，脱氢反应通常是非选择性的。高温还促进较轻烷烃的裂解反应以及焦炭的生成。为了满足行业需求，催化剂不仅需要具有良好的活性和选择性，还需要抑制裂解反应。自Frey和Huppke的开创性工作以来，人们已经认识到支持型铬氧化物催化剂在烷基化脱氢方面的优越性能。特别是铝氧化物（Cr2O3/Al2O3）上的铬氧化物催化剂被广泛用作商用催化剂。

现代研究主要集中在识别活性位点、理解制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种化的影响以及催化活性/选择性，并阐明脱氢机制。在工业过程中，通过燃烧焦炭产生的热量用于脱氢步骤。
