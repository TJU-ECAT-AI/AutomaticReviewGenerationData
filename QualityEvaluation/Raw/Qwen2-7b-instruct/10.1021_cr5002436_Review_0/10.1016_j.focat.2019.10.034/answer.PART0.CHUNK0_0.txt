Propylene, a light olefin, is crucial in the chemical industry due to its extensive applications in various sectors including polymers, pharmaceuticals, and solvents. It is synthesized primarily through catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as the C3 Oleflex technology used by Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical Co. This technology enables the conversion of propane into propylene, which is essential for the production of polymers like polypropylene. The company's new propylene plant has a capacity to produce 450,000 tonnes/year, adding to their existing 900,000 tonnes/year capacity from their first plant, demonstrating the importance of propylene in the chemical industry.
