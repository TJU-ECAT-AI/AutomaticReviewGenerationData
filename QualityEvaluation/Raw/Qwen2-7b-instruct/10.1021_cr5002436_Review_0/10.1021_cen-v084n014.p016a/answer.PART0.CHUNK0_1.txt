[1] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[2] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[3] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

The numerical method described in the document utilizes atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials. These functions provide information about interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs sharing specific spacings. This method enables the calculation of structures for materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles, with subangstrom resolution, even when traditional crystallography methods are not applicable.

该文档中描述的方法利用来自X射线和中子衍射研究的原子对分布函数（PDF）来确定无序材料的原子结构。这些函数提供了关于原子间距离的信息以及共享特定距离的原子对的数量。这种方法能够以亚埃分辨率计算缺乏长程有序的材料，如纳米颗粒的结构，即使传统晶体学方法不可用也是如此，甚至当实验数据存在噪声和实验限制时，计算结构与理想结构C60略有偏差。
