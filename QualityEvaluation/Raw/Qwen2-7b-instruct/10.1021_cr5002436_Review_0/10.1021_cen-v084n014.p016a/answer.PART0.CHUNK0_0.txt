[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."

Numerical methods are used to solve structures of materials without long-range order, such as nanoparticles and nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors. Researchers have developed a computational technique that builds up cluster structures one atom at a time using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. This method, named the Liga method, was applied to determine the structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) using PDF data from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample.

数值方法用于解决缺乏长程有序的材料结构，如纳米颗粒和半导体纳米块。研究人员开发了一种计算技术，通过从X射线和中子衍射研究的粉末和其他非晶态样本中获取的原子对分布函数（PDF）构建簇结构。该方法被称为Liga方法，并应用于使用中子散射测量得到的固体相样品的buckminsterfullerene（C60）结构。
