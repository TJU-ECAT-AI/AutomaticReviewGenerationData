[1] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[2] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[3] "The algorithm 'positions' a small number of atoms in a cluster and then compares the distance list derived from the computer-generated cluster with an experimentally measured list."
[4] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

The numerical method described in the document involves using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) obtained from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials. The method employs an algorithm that positions a small number of atoms in a cluster, compares the derived distance list with an experimental list, and iteratively refines the structure based on the closest match. The method was successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60, a buckyball, and achieved a close match to the experimental data, albeit with slight deviations attributed to noise and experimental limitations.

该文档中描述的方法利用非晶态样品的X射线和中子衍射研究获得的原子对分布函数（PDF）来确定无序材料的原子结构。该方法采用一种算法，将少量原子定位在一个簇中，然后比较生成簇的衍生距离列表与实验列表，并根据最接近的匹配迭代优化结构。该方法成功应用于推导出Buckyball C60的结构，并且其计算的数据集与实验测量结果的匹配程度较高，尽管存在轻微偏差，这是由于数据噪声和实验限制导致的。
