[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "A new computational method, though, is poised to help with the problem. Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."
[5] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

Numerical methods are being developed to solve the structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles and nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, which are typically beyond the capabilities of traditional crystallography methods. One innovative approach involves utilizing computational algorithms that leverage atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) obtained from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples. These PDFs contain lists of interatomic spacings and histograms indicating the frequency of atom pairs at specific distances. This method, named the Liga method, successfully deduced the structure of C60 buckyballs by comparing the calculated data with experimental measurements. However, slight deviations were noted in the computed structure due to noise in the data and limitations of the experimental setup.

对于缺乏长程有序的材料，如纳米尺度的半导体块，数值方法正在被开发用于解决其结构问题，这通常超出了传统晶体学方法的能力。一种创新的方法是利用计算算法，通过从粉末和其他非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究中获得的原子对分布函数（PDFs）来确定无序材料的原子结构。这些PDF包含了一组原子间距列表和一个指示特定距离上原子对频率的直方图。此方法称为Liga方法，成功地通过将计算数据与实验测量结果进行比较，推导出了C60富勒烯的结构。然而，由于数据噪音和实验限制，计算出的结构与理想结构存在轻微差异。
