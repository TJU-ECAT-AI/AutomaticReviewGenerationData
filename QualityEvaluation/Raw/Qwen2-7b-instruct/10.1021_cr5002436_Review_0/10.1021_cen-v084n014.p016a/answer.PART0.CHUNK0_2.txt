The numerical method described in the document allows for the determination of atomic structures in aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and materials lacking long-range order, by utilizing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples. These PDFs consist of interatomic spacing lists and histograms indicating the frequency of specific spacings between atoms. This method has been successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs, showing a close match with experimental data despite slight deviations attributed to data noise and experimental constraints. The researchers suggest that this approach could be widely applicable to other aperiodic materials, offering a valuable tool for understanding their structures without the need for crystalline samples.

在文档中描述的数值方法允许确定无序材料（如纳米颗粒和缺乏长程有序的材料）的原子结构，通过利用从非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究中获得的原子对分布函数（PDF）。这些PDF包含原子间距列表和表示特定间距中原子对频率的直方图。这种方法成功地应用于推导Buckyball C60的结构，实验数据的匹配度较高，尽管存在微小偏差，归因于数据噪声和实验限制。研究人员认为，这种方法可以广泛应用于其他无序材料，提供一种有价值的工具来理解它们的结构，而无需结晶样品。
