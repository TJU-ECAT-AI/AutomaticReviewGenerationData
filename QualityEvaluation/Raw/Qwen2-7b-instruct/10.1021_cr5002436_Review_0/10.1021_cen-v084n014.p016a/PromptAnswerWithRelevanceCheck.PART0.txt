Numerical methods are used to solve structures of materials without long-range order, such as nanoparticles and nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors. Researchers have developed a computational technique that builds up cluster structures one atom at a time using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. This method, named the Liga method, was applied to determine the structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) using PDF data from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample.

The numerical method described in the document utilizes atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials. These functions provide information about interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs sharing specific spacings. This method enables the calculation of structures for materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles, with subangstrom resolution, even when traditional crystallography methods are not applicable.

The numerical method described in the document allows for the determination of atomic structures in aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and materials lacking long-range order, by utilizing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples. These PDFs consist of interatomic spacing lists and histograms indicating the frequency of specific spacings between atoms. This method has been successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs, showing a close match with experimental data despite slight deviations attributed to data noise and experimental constraints. The researchers suggest that this approach could be widely applicable to other aperiodic materials, offering a valuable tool for understanding their structures without the need for crystalline samples.
