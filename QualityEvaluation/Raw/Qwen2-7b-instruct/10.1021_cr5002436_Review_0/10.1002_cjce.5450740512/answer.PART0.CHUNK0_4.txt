<p>Light olefins play a crucial role in the chemical industry, serving as essential building blocks for a wide array of products, from plastics and synthetic fibers to solvents and pharmaceuticals. Their demand is driven by the growing global population, urbanization, and the increasing standard of living, leading to a robust market growth. Key production methods for olefins include steam cracking, catalytic reforming, and ethylene oxide production. The synthesis of olefins faces several thermodynamic challenges, particularly concerning the effects of temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Higher temperatures and pressures typically favor the formation of olefins, but they also increase the risk of side reactions like polymerization and cracking. Longer alkane chains require higher temperatures and pressures for effective cracking, impacting the energy consumption and cost of production.</p>
