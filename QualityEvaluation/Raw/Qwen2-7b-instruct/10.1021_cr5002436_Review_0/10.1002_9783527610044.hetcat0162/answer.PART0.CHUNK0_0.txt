[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry."
[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds."
[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein, or propylene oxide."
[4] "The significance of the remaining light alkenes is low."
[5] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes."
[6] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[7] "World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."
[8] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking."
[9] "To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[10] "The remaining amount was obtained from other processes such as metathesis or deep catalytic cracking (DCC) of vacuum gas oil (VGO)."
[11] "The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation is problematic, despite its simple stoichiometry."
[12] "On the one hand, this is due to the thermodynamic limitation of alkane conversion."
[13] "On the other hand, the reaction is strongly endothermic."
[14] "For example, the following holds true for the dehydrogenation of propane:"
[15] "C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (H298 = +124.3 kJ mol−1)"
[16] "The influence of temperature on the equilibrium is shown in Figure 1."

1. Light alkenes, including ethene and propene, are crucial intermediates in the chemical industry, primarily used for polymer production, specifically polyethylene and polypropylene, and in the synthesis of other polymer compounds, cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein, and propylene oxide.
2. The production of light alkenes through steam cracking is the primary method, accounting for over 60% of propene production, while catalytic cracking contributes around 34%. The rest is derived from processes like metathesis or deep catalytic cracking.
3. The demand for propene is forecasted to grow faster than for ethene, and to meet this demand, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is increasingly utilized, although it faces thermodynamic limitations and requires high temperatures.
4. The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially propane, involves thermodynamic constraints and strong endothermic reactions. For instance, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene is thermodynamically limited and requires significant energy input.

1. 轻烯烃，如乙烯和丙烯，是化学工业中最重要的中间产品之一，主要用于聚合物生产，尤其是高密度聚乙烯、低密度聚乙烯、线性低密度聚乙烯或其它聚合物化合物的前体。
2. 蒸汽裂解是轻烯烃生产的最主要方法，占丙烯产量的大约60%，催化裂化贡献大约34%。其余部分通过过程如共聚或减压渣油深催化裂解获得。
3. 丙烯的需求增长预计将超过乙烯，为了满足这一需求，丙烷的催化脱氢正越来越多地被使用，尽管它面临着热力学限制和需要大量的能量输入。
4. 催化脱氢反应涉及热力学约束和强烈的吸热反应。例如，丙烷脱氢为丙烯在热力学上有限制，并且需要大量的能量输入。
