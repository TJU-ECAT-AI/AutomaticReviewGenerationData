1. Light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, are crucial intermediates in the chemical industry. They are primarily utilized in polymer production, specifically polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as in the creation of other polymer precursors. The global production of ethylene reached 100 million tons in 2003, while propene production amounted to approximately 56 million tons. Steam cracking is the primary method for producing light alkenes, capable of yielding over 100,000 tons annually of ethylene. Propene can also be derived from catalytic cracking, particularly through fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), where it is produced alongside gasoline and kerosene components. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is anticipated to increase in importance relative to overall propene production, given thermodynamic constraints limiting ethylene and propene ratios, the growing demand for propene, and the construction of ethane-based steam crackers that produce limited amounts of propene.

2. The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic limitations, particularly concerning alkane conversion rates. The dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction, exemplified by the equation: C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (H298 = +124.3 kJ mol−1). Achieving technically relevant conversions of 30–50% requires reaction temperatures ranging from 825 to 975 K for propane and 775 to 825 K for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes increases, the optimal reaction temperature decreases. These factors pose significant challenges in the practical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation processes.

1. 轻烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，是化学工业中最重要的中间产品。它们主要用于聚合物生产，特别是高密度聚乙烯、低密度聚乙烯、线性低密度聚乙烯等，以及作为其他聚合物前体的原料。2003年，全球乙烯产量达到1亿吨，而丙烯产量约为5600万吨。蒸汽裂解是生产轻烯烃的主要方法，每年可生产超过100万吨的乙烯。丙烯还可以通过催化裂化（尤其是流化床催化裂化）获得，同时生成汽油和煤油等燃料组分。预计丙烷的催化脱氢在总体丙烯生产中的份额将增加。一方面，这受到烷烃转化热力学限制的影响；另一方面，该反应具有强烈的吸热性质。例如，丙烷脱氢的方程为：C3H8 → C3H6 + H2（H298 = +124.3 kJ/mol）。为了实现技术上相关的30%-50%转化率，丙烷的反应温度需要在825到975 K之间，而异丁烷则在775到825 K之间。随着烷烃碳数的增加，最佳反应温度会降低。这些因素对催化烷烃脱氢过程的实用实现构成了重大挑战。
