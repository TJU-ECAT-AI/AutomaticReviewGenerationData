[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry."
[2] "For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene."
[3] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."
[4] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide."
[5] "World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."
[6] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[7] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes."
[8] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking."
[9] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."
[10] "On the one hand, this is due to the thermodynamic limitation of alkane conversion."
[11] "On the other hand, the reaction is strongly endothermic."
[12] "For example, the following holds true for the dehydrogenation of propane: C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (H298 = +124.3 kJ mol−1)."
[13] "To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications in the production of polymers, including HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, PVC, and various ethylene derivatives. These olefins are typically produced through steam cracking of hydrocarbons and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Steam cracking is the primary method for generating light alkenes, capable of producing over 106 tons annually of ethene. For propene, both steam cracking and catalytic cracking contribute significantly to its production, with approximately 61% and 34% respectively in 2002. To address the growing demand for propene, additional production methods like catalytic dehydrogenation of propane have become essential, given the thermodynamic limitations in increasing propene production solely through steam cracking without affecting ethene yield. The dehydrogenation process faces significant challenges, including thermodynamic constraints and strong endothermic nature, requiring high temperatures to achieve relevant conversions.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色，因其在聚合物生产中的广泛应用，包括高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）、低密度聚乙烯（LDPE）、线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE）、聚氯乙烯（PVC）以及各种乙二醇衍生物。这些烯烃通常通过蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）生产。蒸汽裂解是生成轻烯烃的主要方法，每年可生产超过106吨的乙烯。对于丙烯，蒸汽裂解和催化裂解分别占其生产量的大约61%和34%，在2002年。为了应对丙烯需求的增长，除了仅通过蒸汽裂解提高丙烯产量而不会影响乙烯产量之外，还需要额外的生产方法，例如丙烷的催化脱氢。当前的热力学限制使得仅通过蒸汽裂解提高丙烯产量而不影响乙烯产量变得困难。脱氢过程面临着一系列挑战，包括热力学限制和强烈的吸热性质，需要高温来实现相关转化率。
