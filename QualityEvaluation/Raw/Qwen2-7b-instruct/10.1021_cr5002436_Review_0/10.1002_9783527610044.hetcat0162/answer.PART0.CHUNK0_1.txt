[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry."
[2] "For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."
[3] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."
[4] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide."
[5] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking."
[6] "The remaining amount was obtained from other processes such as metathesis or deep catalytic cracking (DCC) of vacuum gas oil (VGO)."
[7] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."
[8] "On the one hand, the production of propene in existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without limit at the cost of ethene production since, as a matter of principle, thermodynamic limits prevent a propene/ethene ratio of approximately 0.60.7 from being exceeded."
[9] "On the other hand, predominantly ethane-based steam crackers are being built that produce only a small amount of propene, and the production of propene in these systems is generally not economically justifiable."

[36] "[C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (H298 = +124.3 kJ mol−1)]"
[37] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature."
[38] "To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry, serving as essential feedstocks for the production of polymers, particularly polyethylenes, polypropylenes, and other polymer compounds. Ethylene is used to produce HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, as well as precursors for PVC, ethylene glycols, and polyethoxylates. Propylene is vital for polypropylene production and is also utilized in the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein, and propylene oxide. The market trend indicates that the demand for propylene is growing faster than for ethylene.

2. The production of light olefins, including ethylene and propylene, is achieved through various methods, notably steam cracking of hydrocarbons and catalytic cracking. Steam cracking is the primary method for ethylene production, with world-scale crackers capable of producing over 106 tons annually. Catalytic cracking, particularly fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), generates propylene alongside gasoline and kerosene/diesel components from high-boiling fractions of crude oil distillates. Zeolite-type catalysts are preferred in FCC processes.

3. Thermodynamic limitations and strong endothermic nature of alkane dehydrogenation reactions pose significant challenges. For instance, the dehydrogenation of propane follows the equation C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (H298 = +124.3 kJ mol−1). To achieve practical conversion rates of 30–50%, high temperatures of 825–975 K are needed for propane, while isobutane requires temperatures around 775–825 K. The reaction temperature decreases as the alkane's carbon chain length increases.

4. The production of propylene faces constraints in traditional ethane-based crackers, where propylene yields are limited and economic feasibility is questionable. The expansion of propane dehydrogenation processes, particularly catalytic dehydrogenation, is anticipated due to the higher demand for propylene and the ability to produce it from propane sources, which are increasingly available from natural gas processing and crude oil production.

5. The choice of catalysts plays a critical role in the efficiency of alkane dehydrogenation. Platinum-based catalysts have been used in the PACOL process for producing linear alkenes for detergents. Oxidative dehydrogenation has been utilized commercially for the production of 1,3-butadiene, with the Oxo-D process by Petrotex and the O-X-D process by Phillips being notable examples. More recently, systems for the dehydrogenation of isobutane have focused on producing MTBE, a high-octane fuel additive.

6. Commercially available processes for propane dehydrogenation utilize both platinum-based catalysts (UOP Oleflex process, Uhde STAR process, Linde/BASF PDH process) and chromia/alumina catalysts (ABB Lummus CATOFIN process, Snamprogetti-Yarsintez FBD process). The selection of catalyst type depends on the desired product, market conditions, and technological advancements.

7. The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation is challenging due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction. Achieving significant conversion rates necessitates high temperatures, which can be costly and energy-intensive. Moreover, the reaction kinetics and selectivity must be optimized to ensure efficient and economic processes.

1. 轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中至关重要，是生产聚合物（特别是高密度聚乙烯、低密度聚乙烯、线性低密度聚乙烯）和其他聚合物化合物的必要中间体。乙烯主要用于生产聚乙烯（HDPE、LDPE、LLDPE）、聚氯乙烯的前体（1,2-二氯乙烷/乙烯基氯）、乙二醇或聚乙氧基化物的前体。丙烯在聚丙烯生产中起关键作用，并用于生产环己酮、丙烯腈、丙烯酸/丙烯醛或丙烯氧化物。市场需求显示，丙烯的增长率高于乙烯。

2. 轻烯烃（包括乙烯和丙烯）的生产通过多种方法实现，主要为蒸汽裂解和催化裂解。蒸汽裂解是乙烯生产的首要方法，全球规模的裂解装置每年可生产超过106吨乙烯。催化裂解，尤其是流化床催化裂解（FCC），从重质原油馏分中产生丙烯和汽油/柴油成分，同时生成少量丙烯和丁烯等轻烯烃。目前，优选使用沸石催化剂进行FCC过程。

3. 烃类脱氢反应的热力学限制和显著的吸热特性构成了技术挑战。例如，丙烷脱氢遵循方程：C3H8 → C3H6 + H2（H298 = +124.3 kJ mol−1）。为了实现30%至50%的实用转化率，丙烷需要825至975 K的高温，而异丁烷则需要775至825 K的温度。随着烷烃碳链长度的增加，反应温度下降。

4. 传统基于乙烷的裂解器中，丙烯产量受限，经济可行性不高。由于来自天然气处理和原油生产过程中的丙烷来源日益增多，预计丙烷脱氢过程，尤其是催化脱氢，将得到扩大应用，以满足不断增长的丙烯需求。

5. 在不同的工业过程中，根据所需产品、市场条件和技术进步，选择不同的催化剂。铂基催化剂在PACOL过程中用于生产用于洗涤剂的线性烯烃。氧化脱氢商业上首次用于生产1,3-丁二烯，Petrotex的Oxo-D过程和Phillips的O-X-D过程是标志性例子。近期，异丁烷脱氢系统专注于生产MTBE，一种高辛烷值燃料添加剂。

6. 商业可用的丙烷脱氢过程利用铂基催化剂（UOP Oleflex工艺、Uhde STAR工艺、Linde/BASF PDH工艺）和铬基氧化铝催化剂（ABB Lummus CATOFIN工艺、Snamprogetti-Yarsintez FBD工艺）。催化剂的选择取决于目标产物、市场条件和技术发展。

7. 催化烃类脱氢技术的实现存在挑战，主要是由于热力学限制和反应的吸热性质。实现显著的转化率需要高温，这可能成本高昂且能耗大。此外，必须优化反应动力学和选择性以确保高效和经济的过程。
