<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The selective oxidation of paraffins involves several key aspects in catalyst design. Vanadium is often chosen as the preferred element due to its catalytic properties in alkane oxidation. Isolating vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix enhances the catalyst's performance. The stability of the product is crucial for efficient reactions. Multifunctionality serves as both a criterion in designing catalysts and a tool to explain reaction mechanisms. The type of C-H bond activation plays a significant role, as well as the balance between acidity and basicity in the catalyst.
