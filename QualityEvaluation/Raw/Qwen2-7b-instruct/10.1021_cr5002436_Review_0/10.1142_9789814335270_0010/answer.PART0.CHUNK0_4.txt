[1] "This decade has witnessed strong growth in credit card balances in many Asian markets, as some of the potentially biggest credit card markets in the world such China and India are also showing early signs of take-off."
[2] "Meanwhile, some of these markets have experienced episodes of credit card lending booms and busts."
[3] "The boom phase of these cycles is often associated with increased liquidity and competition for market share, laxer lending standards, excess credit expansion and adverse selection; the subsequent bust phase is sometimes exacerbated by the adverse dynamics of contracting credit, liquidity squeeze and moral hazard."
[4] "Rising levels, rapid growth and shifting distribution of household debt may all pose risks to the regions financial systems."
[5] "The dominant role of excessive cash lending is highlighted in all the three recent episodes of credit card lending boom-bust cycles in Asia."
[6] "With deregulation and growing consumer finance, policymakers need to appreciate the risks arising from consumer lending, and put in place appropriate prudential and supervisory measures to contain risks."
[7] "Policymakers need to deploy these measures pre-emptively, ahead of anticipated structural changes and deregulation, as well as lay greater emphasis on both identifying indicators of excessive credit growth and reacting to them."
[8] "Furthermore, adequate market infrastructure for risk management and information sharing is needed for a healthy consumer lending market by mitigating the problem of information asymmetry."
[9] "Nevertheless, some regulations may be counterproductive to the development of this high-yield retail lending sector."
[10] "Credit bureaus may help, but careful attention must also be paid to their operations, as well as to the incentives needed to maintain their integrity, especially in times of easy liquidity, increased market competition, rapid structural changes and fast financial innovation."

Credit card markets in Asia have seen significant growth, especially in markets like China and India, which are showing signs of early expansion. These markets have also experienced credit card lending booms and busts, often characterized by increased liquidity, lax lending standards, and adverse selection. Excessive cash lending plays a significant role in these cycles. Policymakers must recognize the risks associated with consumer lending and implement prudential measures to prevent financial instability.

However, some regulations may hinder the development of high-yield retail lending sectors.
