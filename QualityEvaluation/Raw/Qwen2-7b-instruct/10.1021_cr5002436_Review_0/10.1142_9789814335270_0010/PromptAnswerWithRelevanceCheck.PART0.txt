<quotes>
[1] "With deregulation and growing consumer finance, policymakers need to appreciate the risks arising from consumer lending, and put in place appropriate prudential and supervisory measures to contain risks."
[2] "The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets."
[3] "In retrospect, however, they seem to have also gone hand in hand with a relaxation in the screening and lending standards of card issuers amid intensified market competition."
[4] "In sum, we doubt tax incentives were a principal cause behind Koreas 2003 credit card lending boom."
[5] "In sum, our findings confirm the central role of excessive cash lending in the Korean credit card crisis."
[6] "Indeed, policymakers in other Asian markets have already taken notice of the three Asian episodes and some have responded accordingly."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The credit card lending boom in Asia was driven by several factors including deregulation, growing consumer finance, and tax incentives. Policymakers need to understand the risks associated with consumer lending and implement appropriate prudential and supervisory measures to mitigate these risks. The relaxation of screening and lending standards, alongside increased market competition, contributed to the boom. Despite the presence of tax incentives, it is unclear if they were the primary driver of the boom. Excessive cash lending was identified as a major factor in the Korean credit card crisis. Other Asian markets have recognized the potential risks and have begun implementing measures to address them.

亚洲的信用卡贷款热潮由多项因素驱动，包括放松管制、消费者金融增长以及税收激励。政策制定者需要理解消费者信贷的风险，并采取适当的审慎和监管措施来减轻这些风险。放贷标准的放松与加剧的市场竞争共同推动了繁荣。尽管存在税收激励措施，但它们是否是主要驱动因素尚不明确。过度的现金借贷被确认为韩国信用卡危机中的主要因素。其他亚洲市场已经意识到潜在的风险，并开始实施措施来应对这些问题。

<quotes>

[1] "As commonly happens with the boom of credit to households, aggregate spending received a boost as well. Koreas private consumption expenditure as a share of GDP jumped from 48% in 2000 to 55% in 2002, which helped to sustain the economic recovery after the 1998 recession brought about by the Asian financial crisis."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

2.The surge in household credit fueled a rise in aggregate spending, causing Koreas private consumption as a percentage of GDP to soar from 48% in 2000 to 55% in 2002, aiding in the post-1998 economic recovery following the Asian financial crisis.

[1] "In sum, we doubt tax incentives were a principal cause behind Koreas 2003 credit card lending boom."
[2] "Given that the credit card portfolio typically represented about 5% of the total bank loan book, one may argue that yield spreads of bonds issued by commercial banks might not widen sufficiently and early enough to signal the rising risk."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

6.In summary, we believe tax incentives were not the main driver of the Korean credit card lending boom in 2003.
7.Although the credit card portfolio constituted roughly 5% of the total bank loans, it's possible that the widening of bond yields by commercial banks didn't occur timely or significantly enough to indicate the growing risk.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

6.简而言之，我们认为税收激励并非2003年韩国信用卡贷款热潮的主要原因。
7.尽管信用卡组合约占总银行贷款的5%，但商业银行债券收益率的扩大可能并未及时或显著地表明风险的增加。

The credit card lending in Asia has grown rapidly since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, but this growth has seen several episodes of sharp booms and busts, posing new risks to financial stability. This chapter aims to learn more about the credit card markets and shed light on and draw lessons from some of the core common elements in the three recent episodes of credit card lending distress in Asia: Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan. The Korean credit card lending crisis in 2003, which was the most severe, will be examined closely. Factors such as easy monetary conditions, financial liberalization, economies of scale in the credit card business, limited information reporting and sharing, principal-agent problems, and the seasoning effect of a fast-growing lending portfolio contributed to the unsustainable credit lending boom. Excessive indebtedness led to rising credit costs, tighter lending standards, contracting credit, further credit loss, big balance sheet adjustments, risks to the financial system, and damages to the economy. Policymakers in Asian emerging markets like China and India need to learn about the risks arising from this type of consumer lending and respond with enhanced supervisory capacity, better market infrastructure, and appropriate prudential measures. Understanding the lessons from these episodes will be especially valuable for China and India, where the credit card segment of retail finance is just starting to take off.

自1997年亚洲金融危机以来，亚洲的信用卡借贷迅速增长，但这一增长经历了多次剧烈的繁荣和崩溃，对金融稳定构成了新的风险。本章旨在深入了解信用卡市场，并从亚洲近期信用卡借贷困境的核心共同元素中汲取教训：香港、韩国和台湾。2003年的韩国信用卡借贷危机最为严重，将被详细研究。宽松的货币政策条件、金融自由化、信用卡业务的规模经济、有限的信息报告与共享、委托代理问题、快速增长贷款组合的陈化效应等都是导致不可持续信贷借贷繁荣的因素。过度负债导致了信贷成本上升、收紧放贷标准、信贷收缩、进一步的信贷损失、资产负债表大幅调整、金融系统风险和经济损失。亚洲新兴市场的政策制定者，如中国和印度，需要了解这种消费者借贷带来的风险，并通过增强监管能力、改善市场基础设施和采取适当的审慎措施来做出响应。理解这些事件的教训对于中国和印度尤为重要，这两个国家的信用卡零售金融领域才刚刚起步。

Credit card markets in Asia have seen significant growth, especially in markets like China and India, which are showing signs of early expansion. These markets have also experienced credit card lending booms and busts, often characterized by increased liquidity, lax lending standards, and adverse selection. Excessive cash lending plays a significant role in these cycles. Policymakers must recognize the risks associated with consumer lending and implement prudential measures to prevent financial instability. Preemptive measures and attention to indicators of excessive credit growth are crucial. Adequate risk management and information sharing infrastructure are essential for healthy consumer lending. However, some regulations may hinder the development of high-yield retail lending sectors. Careful consideration must be given to maintaining the integrity of credit reporting systems in times of rapid change and financial innovation.

亚洲的信用卡市场经历了显著增长，特别是在中国和印度等市场，这些市场显示出早期扩张的迹象。这些市场也经历了信用卡借贷繁荣与崩溃的周期，通常伴随着流动性增加、放贷标准宽松和逆向选择。过度的现金借贷在这些周期中起着主导作用。政策制定者必须认识到消费者贷款带来的风险，并实施审慎措施以防止金融危机。预先采取措施和关注过高的信贷增长指标至关重要。适当的风险管理及信息共享基础设施对于健康的消费者贷款市场至关重要，能够缓解信息不对称问题。然而，一些规定可能会阻碍高收益零售贷款部门的发展。在快速变化和金融创新的时期，需要仔细考虑维持信用报告系统完整性的激励机制。
