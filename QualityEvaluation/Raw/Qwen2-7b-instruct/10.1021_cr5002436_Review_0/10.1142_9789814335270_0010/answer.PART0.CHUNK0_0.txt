The credit card lending boom in Asia was driven by several factors including deregulation, growing consumer finance, and tax incentives. Policymakers need to understand the risks associated with consumer lending and implement appropriate prudential and supervisory measures to mitigate these risks. The relaxation of screening and lending standards, alongside increased market competition, contributed to the boom. Despite the presence of tax incentives, it is unclear if they were the primary driver of the boom. Excessive cash lending was identified as a major factor in the Korean credit card crisis. Other Asian markets have recognized the potential risks and have begun implementing measures to address them.
