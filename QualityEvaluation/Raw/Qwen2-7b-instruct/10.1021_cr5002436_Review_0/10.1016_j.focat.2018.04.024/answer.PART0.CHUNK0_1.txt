Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in various sectors including plastics, fuels, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Their market trends often align with global economic conditions and advancements in technology. Key production methods include steam cracking, where hydrocarbons are broken down under high temperatures and pressures to yield olefins. Thermodynamic challenges related to these processes include optimizing temperature and pressure to maximize yields while minimizing side reactions. Additionally, the length of the alkane chain can influence the efficiency and selectivity of the cracking process. In relation to temperature and pressure, higher temperatures generally promote faster reactions but may lead to increased formation of unwanted products, whereas higher pressures can stabilize the reaction and reduce the risk of undesirable side reactions.
