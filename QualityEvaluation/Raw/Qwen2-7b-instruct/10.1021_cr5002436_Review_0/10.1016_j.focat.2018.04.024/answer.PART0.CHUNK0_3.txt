1. The new $1.7 billion ethane steam cracker being constructed alongside Total's Port Arthur refinery and Total/BASF's existing steam cracker is a significant investment for olefin production. Propylene and ethylene, key light olefins, are vital feedstocks for the chemical industry. These olefins are utilized in the manufacture of various downstream products such as polymers, solvents, and fuels. Steam cracking is a common process for producing olefins, involving the breakdown of hydrocarbons into lighter olefinic compounds. Temperature and pressure are critical factors in these processes, influencing reaction efficiency and selectivity. Additionally, the length of alkane chains can affect the yield and purity of olefinic products during the cracking process.
