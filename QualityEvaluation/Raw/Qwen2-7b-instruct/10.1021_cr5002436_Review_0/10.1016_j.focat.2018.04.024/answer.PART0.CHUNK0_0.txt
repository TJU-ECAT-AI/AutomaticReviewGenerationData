Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications and market trends. These hydrocarbons are essential feedstocks for a wide range of chemical products, including polymers, fuels, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The production of light olefins often involves several key methods, such as steam cracking of naphtha, natural gas, or heavy oil, and the thermal cracking of petroleum fractions under high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges associated with these processes include managing the balance between product yield and purity, as well as optimizing the reaction conditions to achieve maximum efficiency. The temperature and pressure settings significantly influence the cracking rates and the selectivity of the desired olefin products. Longer alkane chains require higher temperatures and pressures for effective conversion to lighter olefins. The synthesis of light olefins thus requires careful control over these parameters to ensure optimal production yields and product quality.
