1. Calcium carbonate is widely utilized as a filler in various industries including plastics, paper, rubber, coatings, light chemicals, and architectural materials. The global market dynamics are closely tied to the paper, automotive, plastics, and construction sectors, which are influenced by the global economy's cyclical changes. Asia Pacific leads as the largest and fastest-growing market for calcium carbonate, driven by the rapid development of its plastics and paper industries.

2. Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) constitutes the largest and fastest-growing product segment within the global market.

3. The global demand for carbon black is anticipated to experience significant growth until 2019, as indicated by a recent market study by Ceresana Research. By 2019, the market volume is projected to expand by over 3.1 million tonnes compared to 2011 levels.

4. Asia Pacific emerges as the primary driving force for growth, with consumption and production volumes in the region expected to increase by more than 4.5% annually. Notably, China alone consumes over 30% of the global carbon black market volume, and this region is poised to become a net exporter in the future due to substantial capacity expansions.

5. ASTM International has developed a new standard, ASTM D7823, for identifying and qualifying specific phthalates in poly(vinyl chloride) plastics. This standard was developed by Subcommittee D20.70 on Analytical Methods and covers six phthalates, including DBP, BBP, DEHP, DNOP, DINP, and DIDP. These phthalates are utilized as plasticizers in various polymers, including rubber and nitrocellulose. Laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers will utilize this standard to ascertain compliance with the requirements of Section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which prohibits certain products from containing these specified phthalates. The standard also addresses other regulations on these phthalates, such as EU Directive 2005/84/EC and Japan's Health, Labor, and Welfare Ministry Guideline No. 336 (2010).

1. 碳酸钙在塑料、纸张、橡胶、涂层、轻化工和建筑材料等多个行业中广泛用作填料。全球市场的动态与造纸、汽车、塑料和建筑行业紧密相关，这些行业受到全球经济周期性波动的影响。亚太地区是最大的和增长最快的碳酸钙市场，其塑料和纸张工业的快速发展将推动未来的增长。

2. 细磨碳酸钙（GCC）构成了全球市场上最大的和增长最快的细分产品。

3. 根据Ceresana研究的最新市场研究，全球对碳黑的需求预计将在2019年之前实现动态增长。到2019年，市场规模预计将比2011年的水平增加超过310万吨。

4. 令人不意外的是，亚太地区成为增长的主要推动力；该地区的消费和生产量预计每年将分别增长超过4.5%。值得注意的是，仅中国就消耗了全球碳黑市场总量的超过30%，这个地区有望在未来成为净出口国，这归因于产能的大幅扩张。

5. ASTM国际开发了一项新的标准，即ASTM D7823，用于识别和验证聚氯乙烯塑料中的低水平、受管制的邻苯二甲酸酯。这项标准由D20.70分析方法分委会制定，涵盖了六种邻苯二甲酸酯，包括DBP、BBP、DEHP、DNOP、DINP和DIDP。这些邻苯二甲酸酯被用作橡胶和硝化纤维素等多种聚合物的增塑剂。实验室、监管机构和制造商将使用此标准来确定是否符合《消费者产品安全改进法》2008年修正案第108节的要求，该法案禁止某些产品含有这些指定的邻苯二甲酸酯。此外，该标准还涉及欧盟指令2005/84/EC和其他法规对这些邻苯二甲酸酯的规定，如日本劳动和福利省指南第336号（2010年）。

The global market for additives, specifically focusing on calcium carbonate (CaCO3), ground calcium carbonate (GCC), and carbon black, is closely tied to the dynamics of industries such as paper, automotive, plastics, and construction. These sectors are significantly influenced by the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy. Notably, Asia Pacific represents the largest and fastest-growing regional market for CaCO3, driven by the rapid progress of its plastics and paper industries. Ground CaCO3 (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market, with robust demand in Asian countries. North America and Europe are expected to register lackluster growth in GCC. The demand for carbon black in the tire production sector is the largest sales market, and the growth is driven by the sound development of the automotive market. Asia Pacific, especially China, is the main driver for growth in the carbon black market, consuming over 30% of the total global market volume. Environmental, health, and safety issues related to additives, such as the identification and qualification of phthalates in PVC, are regulated under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) in the United States, with ASTM International providing a standard method for testing these substances.
