The global market for additives, specifically focusing on calcium carbonate (CaCO3), ground calcium carbonate (GCC), and carbon black, is closely tied to the dynamics of industries such as paper, automotive, plastics, and construction. These sectors are significantly influenced by the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy. Notably, Asia Pacific represents the largest and fastest-growing regional market for CaCO3, driven by the rapid progress of its plastics and paper industries. Ground CaCO3 (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market, with robust demand in Asian countries. North America and Europe are expected to register lackluster growth in GCC. The demand for carbon black in the tire production sector is the largest sales market, and the growth is driven by the sound development of the automotive market. Asia Pacific, especially China, is the main driver for growth in the carbon black market, consuming over 30% of the total global market volume. Environmental, health, and safety issues related to additives, such as the identification and qualification of phthalates in PVC, are regulated under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) in the United States, with ASTM International providing a standard method for testing these substances.

全球添加剂市场，特别是针对碳酸钙（CaCO3）、地面碳酸钙（GCC）和碳黑，与纸张、汽车、塑料和建筑等行业的发展动态紧密相关。这些行业受全球经济周期性波动影响显著。亚太地区是CaCO3的最大和增长最快的区域市场，其塑料和纸张工业的快速发展推动了这一市场的增长。GCC是全球市场中最大和增长最快的细分产品，亚洲国家的需求非常强劲。北美和欧洲在GCC领域预计将呈现缓慢增长。轮胎生产领域的碳黑需求是最大的销售市场，其增长受到汽车行业良好发展的驱动。亚洲太平洋地区，尤其是中国，是碳黑市场增长的主要驱动力，消耗了全球碳黑市场总量超过30%的份额。碳黑市场的发展主要由汽车市场的健康发展所驱动。碳黑在轮胎制造中的应用是其主要销售市场。环保、健康和安全问题与添加剂有关，例如美国消费者产品安全改进法案2008年（CPSIA）对PVC中特定六种邻苯二甲酸盐的禁止，美国材料试验学会（ASTM国际）提供了检测这些物质的标准方法。
