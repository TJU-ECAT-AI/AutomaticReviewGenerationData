The global market dynamics are significantly influenced by trends in the paper, automotive, plastics, and construction industries, which are affected by the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy. Asia Pacific is the largest and fastest-growing market for calcium carbonate (CaCO3), driven by the rapid expansion of its plastics and paper industries. Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market. The report offers a comprehensive analysis of market trends, issues, drivers, company profiles, and strategic industry activities, providing market estimates, projections, and detailed analysis of GCC and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) product segments and their end-use markets. The automotive industry is the largest sales market for carbon black, crucial for both the tire segment and the utilization of various rubber products. Asia Pacific is the primary driver of growth, with consumption and production volumes in this region expected to increase by more than 4.5% annually. The ASTM International standard ASTM D7823 provides a method for identifying and qualifying low-level regulated phthalates in poly(vinyl chloride) plastics, used by analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) law.
