How do light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends, and what are the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects?

The market value of catalysts is predicted to rise to more than $22 billion by 2021. In Western Europe, demand for catalysts is declining, especially in southern EU countries due to the financial crisis. Polymerization is expected to show the most dynamic development at an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 3.1% per year until 2021, with polyethylene and polypropylene synthesis accounting for the majority of the market. The global zeolite market is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.33% from 2013 to 2018, driven by increased usage in catalysis and petroleum refining. There is also a trend towards increasing production capacities. Ethylene producers in North America are increasingly favoring natural gas-based feedstocks over traditional petroleum-derived naphtha due to the shale gas boom. The total annual production of biobased chemicals was around 113 million tonnes in 2013, with ethanol capacity reaching approximately 89 million tonnes. Bio-based chemicals have gained popularity due to lower greenhouse gas emissions and consumer demand for sustainability. BASF and Linde are collaborating to develop a process for the on-purpose production of butadiene from butanes. This new process will offer an alternative route for butadiene production, reducing dependence on naphtha-cracking co-products. Beijing Bihua Environmental Engineering has developed nano photocatalytic air purification products with demonstrated effectiveness in antibacterial, antifungal, air purification, pollution prevention, and self-cleaning capabilities. Calysta and NatureWorks have successfully collaborated on fermenting methane into lactic acid, targeting a commercially viable process for this conversion.

In terms of thermodynamic challenges, the synthesis of light olefins typically involves complex reactions that require precise control of temperature and pressure. Alkane chain length affects the yield and selectivity of the reaction. For instance, the cracking of heavier hydrocarbons into lighter olefins requires high temperatures and pressures, and the optimal conditions depend on the specific feedstock and desired product distribution.
