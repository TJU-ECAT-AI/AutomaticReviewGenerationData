The synthesis of light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, is crucial in the chemical industry for various applications and market trends. They are used in the production of polymers, solvents, and various chemical intermediates. Key production methods involve thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, which is a thermodynamically challenging process due to the high temperatures and pressures involved. The efficiency and selectivity of the process depend on understanding the kinetics of the reactions, particularly the rate constants and activation energies. The calculation of these parameters relies on transition-state theory, which involves estimating the standard entropy of the activated complex and the frequency factors. The one-dimensional reactor model provides a simplified approach to predict the behavior of the reactor under various operating conditions. However, for more complex scenarios, two-dimensional models might be necessary, despite their computational demands. The chain mechanism of thermal decomposition involves the participation of free radicals as chain carriers, leading to a series of initiation, propagation, and termination reactions. The difficulty in constructing kinetic models lies in accurately assigning values to the rate constants of individual reactions, aiming for a systematic approach that minimizes the number of parameters while maintaining the fundamental consistency of the model.
