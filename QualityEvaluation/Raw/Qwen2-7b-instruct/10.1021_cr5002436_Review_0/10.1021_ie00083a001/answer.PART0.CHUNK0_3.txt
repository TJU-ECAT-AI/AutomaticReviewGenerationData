The kinetic modeling of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons employs a free-radical reaction scheme involving numerous reactions. The process typically follows free-radical mechanisms. Constructing a kinetic model entails determining frequency factors and activation energies for each reaction. The calculation of frequency factors relies on finding the standard entropy of the activated complex, as per transition-state theory. For industrial reactors, the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons operates at high temperatures, around 850-900 °C, which is suitable for applying transition-state theory. The activated complex for reversible reactions remains unchanged for both forward and backward steps. Determining the symmetry number of a molecule requires a detailed examination of its spatial structure. However, for reactions with well-known symmetry numbers, both approaches yield consistent results.

热裂解的亲和模型通过包含数百个反应的自由基反应方案进行。该过程通常遵循自由基机制。构建动力学模型涉及为每个反应确定频率因子和活化能。频率因子的计算依赖于根据过渡态理论找到激活复合物的标准熵。对于工业反应器，热裂解在大约850-900 °C的高温下运行，这适用于应用过渡态理论。可逆反应的激活复合物在正向和反向步骤中保持不变。确定分子的对称数需要详细检查其空间结构。然而，对于具有已知对称数的反应，两种方法的结果一致。
