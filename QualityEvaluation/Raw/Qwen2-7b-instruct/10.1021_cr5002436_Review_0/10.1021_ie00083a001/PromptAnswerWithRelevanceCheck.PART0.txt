The thermal cracking of hydrocarbons is known to proceed through free-radical mechanisms. The modeling of thermal cracking based upon these mechanisms requires a kinetic model containing several hundreds of reactions. The earlier kinetic models used a limited number of globalizing molecular reactions to describe the stoichiometry of the process 0888-58851 881 2627- 1959$01.50/0 (Sundaram and Froment, 1977a,b).Because of their globalizing nature, these models are only valid for specific feedstocks and for a limited range of operating conditions. Recent modeling work in the field of thermal cracking concentrates on the use of free-radical reaction mechanisms (Sundaram and Froment, 1978; Edelson and Allara, 1980; Goossens et al., 1979; Scharfe et al., 1985). This is presently generally recognized as the only possible approach to obtain a model which is valid over a wide range of operating conditions and for different feedstocks.

The one-dimensional mathematical reactor model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations describing the change in composition, temperature, and pressure as a function of the axial position in the reactor. Plug flow conditions are met well in thermal cracking reactors because of the high Reynolds number at which they operate. Only moderate heat fluxes are used in classical reactors, and in this case, the one-dimensional model is sufficiently accurate. In reactors with high heat fluxes, however, significant radial temperature gradients may exist. In turn, the radial temperature profile causes radial concentration profiles because of the differences in reaction rate. In this case, it becomes necessary to use a two-dimensional model which considers changes in temperature and composition in both radial and axial directions (Sundaram and Fro- ment, 1979).

Answer: A one-dimensional mathematical reactor model uses a series of ordinary differential equations to describe changes in composition, temperature, and pressure along the axial position within the reactor. This model works well in thermal cracking reactors due to their high Reynolds number, requiring only moderate heat fluxes. However, in reactors with high heat fluxes, significant radial temperature gradients may occur, influencing concentration profiles. In such scenarios, a two-dimensional model accounting for temperature and composition changes in both radial and axial directions is necessary.

The synthesis of light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, is crucial in the chemical industry for various applications and market trends. They are used in the production of polymers, solvents, and various chemical intermediates. Key production methods involve thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, which is a thermodynamically challenging process due to the high temperatures and pressures involved. The efficiency and selectivity of the process depend on understanding the kinetics of the reactions, particularly the rate constants and activation energies. The calculation of these parameters relies on transition-state theory, which involves estimating the standard entropy of the activated complex and the frequency factors. The one-dimensional reactor model provides a simplified approach to predict the behavior of the reactor under various operating conditions. However, for more complex scenarios, two-dimensional models might be necessary, despite their computational demands. The chain mechanism of thermal decomposition involves the participation of free radicals as chain carriers, leading to a series of initiation, propagation, and termination reactions. The difficulty in constructing kinetic models lies in accurately assigning values to the rate constants of individual reactions, aiming for a systematic approach that minimizes the number of parameters while maintaining the fundamental consistency of the model.

The kinetic modeling of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons employs a free-radical reaction scheme involving numerous reactions. Simulation models are crucial in modern thermal cracking plants. Stoichiometric changes in the reactor are described by a kinetic model. In the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, smaller free radicals function as chain carriers. Assigning values to the rate constants of individual reactions poses the greatest challenge in building a kinetic model. For each reaction, both the frequency factor and activation energy need to be determined. Frequency factors are calculated using a combination of transition-state theory and statistical thermodynamics. The standard entropy of a closely related parent molecule serves as the initial estimate. Statistical thermodynamics accounts for the differences in degrees of freedom between the activated complex and the parent molecule.

Constructing a kinetic model entails determining frequency factors and activation energies for each reaction. The calculation of frequency factors relies on finding the standard entropy of the activated complex, as per transition-state theory. For industrial reactors, the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons operates at high temperatures, around 850-900 °C, which is suitable for applying transition-state theory. The activated complex for reversible reactions remains unchanged for both forward and backward steps.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry for their extensive applications and market trends. They are widely used in the production of polymers, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, which are essential materials in various industries including packaging, automotive, and construction. Market trends often focus on the increasing demand for these olefins due to advancements in polymer technology and growing consumer demand for lightweight, durable, and sustainable products.

The key production methods for olefins include steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Steam cracking involves the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons in the presence of steam at high temperatures and pressures. This process is highly temperature-sensitive, as the yield and selectivity of olefins depend on the operating conditions. Pressure plays a significant role in the efficiency of steam cracking, with higher pressures enhancing the conversion rates but potentially reducing the yield of lighter olefins.

Alkane chain length effects are critical in olefin production. Longer chain alkanes typically require higher temperatures and pressures for effective cracking, leading to a greater formation of heavier hydrocarbons before the desired olefin products are produced. Optimizing these conditions is crucial for maximizing olefin yield while minimizing waste products.

Thermodynamically, the cracking process involves the activation of the hydrocarbon molecules, leading to the formation of olefins and other products. Transition-state theory is utilized to calculate the frequency factors and activation energies of these reactions. The calculations rely on the standard entropies and enthalpies of activation, which are determined through statistical thermodynamics and transition-state theory.

The standard activation entropy plays a pivotal role in determining the frequency factors of the reactions. Parameters such as bond elongation factors, vibrational frequencies, and symmetry numbers are introduced to quantify the changes in entropy during the transition from reactants to products. These parameters are derived from experimental data and theoretical considerations, ensuring the accuracy of the kinetic modeling.

The optimization of these parameters is crucial for achieving the desired product distribution in olefin production. Simulation models, incorporating kinetic models and reactor models, are employed to predict and optimize the operational conditions for maximum efficiency and yield. These models consider the interplay between temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects to achieve optimal olefin synthesis.

In summary, the synthesis of light olefins like propylene and ethylene involves sophisticated kinetic modeling and simulation techniques to optimize the production process under controlled thermodynamic conditions. The success of these processes relies on a deep understanding of the underlying chemical reactions, their thermodynamics, and the ability to fine-tune operational parameters for maximum efficiency and yield.
