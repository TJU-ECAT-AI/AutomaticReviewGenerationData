The kinetic modeling of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons employs a free-radical reaction scheme involving numerous reactions. Simulation models are crucial in modern thermal cracking plants. Stoichiometric changes in the reactor are described by a kinetic model. In the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, smaller free radicals function as chain carriers. Assigning values to the rate constants of individual reactions poses the greatest challenge in building a kinetic model. For each reaction, both the frequency factor and activation energy need to be determined. Frequency factors are calculated using a combination of transition-state theory and statistical thermodynamics. The standard entropy of a closely related parent molecule serves as the initial estimate. Statistical thermodynamics accounts for the differences in degrees of freedom between the activated complex and the parent molecule. The Arrhenius equation is modified to calculate activation energy and frequency factor.

热裂解的分子动力学模型采用自由基反应方案，包含数百个反应。在现代热裂解工厂中，模拟模型扮演着非常重要的角色。描述反应器内化学计量变化和其发生速率的是一个动力学模型。在热分解过程中，较小的自由基作为链载体发挥作用。构建动力学模型时，确定单个反应的反应速率常数是最困难的部分。每个反应都需要频率因子和活化能的值。频率因子通过结合过渡态理论和统计热力学进行计算。与激活复合物结构相近的母分子的标准熵用作初始估算点。统计热力学用于考虑激活复合物与母分子之间的自由度差异。Arrhenius方程被修改以计算活化能和频率因子。
