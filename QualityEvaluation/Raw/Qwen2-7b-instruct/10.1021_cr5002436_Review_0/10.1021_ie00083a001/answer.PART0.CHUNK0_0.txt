The thermal cracking of hydrocarbons is known to proceed through free-radical mechanisms. The modeling of thermal cracking based upon these mechanisms requires a kinetic model containing several hundreds of reactions. The earlier kinetic models used a limited number of globalizing molecular reactions to describe the stoichiometry of the process 0888-58851 881 2627- 1959$01.50/0 (Sundaram and Froment, 1977a,b).Because of their globalizing nature, these models are only valid for specific feedstocks and for a limited range of operating conditions. Recent modeling work in the field of thermal cracking concentrates on the use of free-radical reaction mechanisms (Sundaram and Froment, 1978; Edelson and Allara, 1980; Goossens et al., 1979; Scharfe et al., 1985). This is presently generally recognized as the only possible approach to obtain a model which is valid over a wide range of operating conditions and for different feedstocks.

Answer: The modeling of thermal cracking through free-radical mechanisms requires a kinetic model with several hundred reactions to accurately describe the process. Early models used a limited number of globalizing molecular reactions, making them valid only for specific feedstocks and conditions. Modern approaches focus on utilizing free-radical reaction mechanisms to create models applicable across a wide range of operating conditions and for diverse feedstocks.

通过自由基机制进行热裂解的建模需要包含数百个反应的动力学模型，以准确描述这一过程。早期的模型仅使用有限数量的全局分子反应来描述过程的化学计量学，因此它们只适用于特定的原料和操作条件。现代方法侧重于利用自由基反应机制来创建适用于广泛的操作条件和不同原料的模型。

The standard entropy of a parent molecule whose structure is close to that of the activated complex is used as a starting point in the estimation. The differences in the degrees of freedom between the activated complex and the parent molecule are taken into account by means of statistical thermodynamics.

Answer: The standard entropy of a closely structured parent molecule serves as the initial estimate for the activated complex. Statistical thermodynamics is utilized to account for the variations in degrees of freedom between the activated complex and the parent molecule.

The one-dimensional mathematical reactor model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations describing the change in composition, temperature, and pressure as a function of the axial position in the reactor. Plug flow conditions are met well in thermal cracking reactors because of the high Reynolds number at which they operate. Only moderate heat fluxes are used in classical reactors, and in this case, the one-dimensional model is sufficiently accurate. In reactors with high heat fluxes, however, significant radial temperature gradients may exist. In turn, the radial temperature profile causes radial concentration profiles because of the differences in reaction rate. In this case, it becomes necessary to use a two-dimensional model which considers changes in temperature and composition in both radial and axial directions (Sundaram and Fro- ment, 1979).

Answer: A one-dimensional mathematical reactor model uses a series of ordinary differential equations to describe changes in composition, temperature, and pressure along the axial position within the reactor. This model works well in thermal cracking reactors due to their high Reynolds number, requiring only moderate heat fluxes. However, in reactors with high heat fluxes, significant radial temperature gradients may occur, influencing concentration profiles. In such scenarios, a two-dimensional model accounting for temperature and composition changes in both radial and axial directions is necessary.

一维数学反应器模型由一系列常微分方程组成，用于描述沿反应器轴向位置的变化，包括组成、温度和压力。在热裂解反应器中，由于其较高的雷诺数，这种模型工作良好，只需要适度的热流密度。然而，在高热流密度的反应器中，可能会存在显著的径向温度梯度，影响浓度分布。在这种情况下，需要使用二维模型来考虑温度和组成在径向和轴向方向上的变化（Sundaram 和 Fro-ment, 1979）。
