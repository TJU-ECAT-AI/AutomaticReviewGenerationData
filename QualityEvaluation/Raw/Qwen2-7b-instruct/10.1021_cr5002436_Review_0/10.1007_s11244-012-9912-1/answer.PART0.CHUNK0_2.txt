Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications, including plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and various chemical intermediates. The increasing demand for these products, coupled with the availability of cheaper ethane feedstock, has led to a significant growth in the production of light paraffins through dehydrogenation processes. This growth is expected to continue due to the abundance of wet shale gas resources worldwide. Over the next five years, it is anticipated that more than 5 million tons of propane dehydrogenation capacity will be installed to meet the rising demand for propylene. The thermodynamic challenges associated with dehydrogenation processes, such as high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, necessitate the operation of these processes at high temperatures and lower pressures to achieve economic conversion levels. To overcome these challenges, advancements in catalyst design and performance are essential. The integration of catalytic dehydrogenation with selective hydrogen oxidation not only enhances equilibrium conversions but also maintains high selectivity, offering an optimized solution for olefin production.
