[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene has become a critical technology to fill the propylene shortage, which is increasing due to the portion of steam crackers now using inexpensive ethane feedstock."
[2] "This trend is expected to continue in the near future due to the abundance of wet shale gas worldwide."
[3] "Over 5 million tons of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation capacity is expected in the next 5 years."
[4] "Catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production."
[5] "For light paraffin dehydrogenation, UOP has licensed the Oleflex process widely for production of polymer-grade propylene as well as isobutylene with over 12 million metric tons of capacity announced."
[6] "Today there are nine UOP C3 Oleflex units in operation accounting for 55 % of the installed world-wide propylene production capacity from propane dehydrogenation technology."
[7] "The heart of the process is a noble metal multi-metallic catalyst and the continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) process."
[8] "The coupling of catalytic dehydrogenation with selective oxidation of hydrogen allows one to design a process, which greatly improves equilibrium conversions while maintaining very high selectivity to olefin."
[9] "For example, Table 1 shows the performance of three Ptalumina catalysts, with identical composition and dispersion, having average pore diameters varying by a factor of seven."
[10] "There is a limit to this approach as increasing pore diameter too far, as for Catalyst C, is accompanied by lower available surface area to disperse the metals, hence, activity is reduced significantly."
[11] "Beyond providing porosity for mass transport, the catalyst support must provide the surface area to disperse noble metals and modifiers."
[12] "UOP has commercialized many generations of propane and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation catalysts, which support further advancements in Oleflex and linear alkylbenzene detergent technology."
[13] "The Lummus/UOP SMART process employs an innovative catalytic oxidation technology to selectively burn the hydrogen liberated by the dehydrogenation of EB."
[14] "Higher EB conversion in SMART means that less unconverted EB must be recycled, which results in lower capital cost and utility consumption per ton of SM product."
[15] "The oxidative reheat feature eliminates the need to expand the capacity of the existing steam superheater to accommodate additional SM capacity."
[16] "The key to any oxidative reheat process is the selective oxidation catalyst, which must be able to selectively combust H2 without combusting or steam reforming ethylbenzene/styrene."
[17] "The catalyst needs to completely convert all the oxygen added for reheating since unreacted oxygen can poison FeK styrene dehydrogenation catalysts."
[18] "Clearly, catalyst OC-3 in Table 4 shows superior activity and activity stability based on oxygen conversion and the ability to maintain the theoretical 60 C temperature rise across the oxidation catalyst zone."
[19] "Of course, the majority of the phase in OC-3 was alpha alumina and as such, the dispersion and maintenance of noble metal dispersion is a major factor in catalyst design."
[20] "Figure 4 shows the pilot performance of advanced oxidation catalyst approaching 1 year on stream maintaining 100 % oxygen conversion with 92 % selectivity for the combustion of hydrogen."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry. They are used extensively in the production of polymers, solvents, and various chemical intermediates. The market for these olefins is expanding due to the increasing demand for plastic products, packaging, and other chemical applications. Key production methods involve catalytic dehydrogenation, where propane is converted to propylene and ethylene is produced from ethane. Thermodynamic challenges include operating at high temperatures and pressures to ensure economic conversion levels, while managing the balance between reaction kinetics and equilibrium constraints. 

Temperature effects are significant, with processes typically requiring high temperatures (over 600°C) to achieve adequate conversion. Lower pressures (less than 30 psig) are favored to maintain selectivity towards olefins. Alkane chain length affects the ease of dehydrogenation; shorter chains, like propane, are easier to convert to propylene compared to longer chains. The Oleflex process, licensed by UOP, is widely used for producing propylene and isobutylene. It utilizes a multi-metallic catalyst and a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) process. The coupling of catalytic dehydrogenation with selective hydrogen oxidation enhances efficiency and selectivity. Catalyst design focuses on mass transport optimization, including pore structure and surface area for metal dispersion. Oxidative reheat techniques, like the SMART process, improve energy efficiency by shifting the reaction equilibrium towards the desired product. Oxidative catalysts must selectively combust hydrogen without affecting the downstream dehydrogenation process. Long-term stability and high oxygen conversion are critical for optimal performance.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中的作用至关重要。它们广泛用于聚合物、溶剂以及各种化学中间体的生产。这些烯烃市场的发展得益于塑料产品、包装等化学品需求的增长。主要生产方法是催化脱氢，将丙烷转化为丙烯，从乙烷中制取乙烯。热力学挑战包括在确保经济转化水平的同时，管理反应动力学与平衡约束之间的平衡，通常需要在较高温度（超过600°C）下操作，并采用较低压力（低于30 psig）以维持向烯烃的选择性。

短链烷烃，如丙烷，相对于长链烷烃更容易转化为丙烯。氧化还原过程，如UOP的Oleflex工艺，被广泛应用以生产丙烯和异丁烯。它使用多金属催化剂和连续催化剂再生（CCR）过程。催化脱氢与选择性氢氧化的耦合提高了效率和选择性。催化剂设计专注于优化质量传输，包括孔结构和表面面积以实现金属分散。氧化还原技术，如SMART过程，通过将反应平衡转向目标产物来提高能效。氧化催化剂必须在不影响下游脱氢过程的情况下选择性地燃烧氢气。长期稳定性及高氧转化率对于最佳性能至关重要。
