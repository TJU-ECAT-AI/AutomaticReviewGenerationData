1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in various sectors including plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and fuels. Their demand is growing with the rise in global industrialization and population, particularly as the feedstock for producing high-value chemicals and materials. The synthesis of these olefins, however, faces thermodynamic challenges related to the high reaction enthalpy and equilibrium limitations, necessitating high-temperature operations and low pressures to achieve economic conversion levels.

2. The design of dehydrogenation catalysts involves fundamental principles of catalysis aimed at minimizing diffusional resistance and ensuring a stable chemical composition under operating conditions. This includes the development of advanced multi-metallic catalysts that can efficiently convert paraffins to olefins with high selectivity and stability. 

3. By integrating catalytic dehydrogenation with selective oxidation of hydrogen, the efficiency of olefin production processes can be significantly enhanced. This approach enables the optimization of equilibrium conversions while preserving high selectivity to specific olefin products, such as styrene, thereby improving overall process economics and efficiency.
