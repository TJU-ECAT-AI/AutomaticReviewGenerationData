[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation continues to grow in importance for the production of olefins, especially with the availability of inexpensive light paraffin supplies."

[3] "The coupling of catalytic dehydrogenation with selective oxidation of hydrogen allows one to design a process, which greatly improves equilibrium ethylbenzene conversions while maintaining very high selectivity to styrene."
[4] "The reaction of olefins on unmodified platinum is faster than that of paraffins because olefins interact with platinum more strongly than do paraffins."
[5] "The key to any oxidative reheat process is the selective oxidation catalyst, which must be able to selectively combust H2 without combusting or steam reforming ethylbenzene/styrene."
[6] "The majority of the phase in OC-3 was alpha alumina and as such, the dispersion and maintenance of noble metal dispersion is a major factor in catalyst design."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in the production of polymers, plastics, solvents, and fuels. The market for these olefins is growing, particularly with the availability of inexpensive light paraffins. The synthesis of olefins through catalytic dehydrogenation involves several thermodynamic challenges. To achieve economic conversion levels, the process operates at high temperatures (above 600°C) and lower pressures (below 30 psig). The primary requirements for dehydrogenation catalyst design include high activity and selectivity, controlled by managing both chemical and mass transport properties. Key aspects of catalyst design include:

1. Reducing physical diffusion paths through smaller particles, shaped particles, and monolithic supports.
2. Modifying pore architecture to improve feed and product diffusion rates.
3. Employing methodologies to achieve a higher surface concentration of active components.

To avoid high carbon deposition and side reactions, the chemical composition of dehydrogenation catalysts must prevent carbon buildup and ensure the stability against coking by heavy carbonaceous materials. Platinum modifiers play a role in weakening the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. The SMART process introduces oxidative reheating to increase the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process by selectively burning hydrogen, thus reducing steam consumption and shifting the reaction equilibrium towards production of styrene monomer. The oxidative reheat catalyst must be selective for hydrogen combustion, stable without requiring regeneration, and have no adverse effect on pressure drop.

Answer: Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are vital for the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications. Their synthesis through catalytic dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges, necessitating high-temperature and low-pressure conditions. Catalyst design focuses on reducing diffusion resistance and ensuring chemical stability under process conditions. The coupling of catalytic dehydrogenation with selective hydrogen oxidation enhances equilibrium conversions while maintaining high selectivity. Platinum modifiers and oxidative reheat catalysts are critical in this process, requiring specific design criteria to ensure optimal performance and stability.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们在聚合物、塑料、溶剂和燃料的生产中有着广泛的应用。这些烯烃市场的增长，特别是由于廉价轻烷烃的可用性。通过催化脱氢合成烯烃涉及几个热力学挑战。为了实现经济转化率，该过程在高于600°C的高温和低于30 psig的压力下运行。脱氢催化剂设计的主要要求包括高活性和选择性，通过管理化学和质量传输性质来控制。催化剂设计的关键方面包括：

1. 通过使用更小的颗粒、形状颗粒和多孔支撑体减少物理扩散路径。
2. 修改孔结构以提高原料和产品扩散速率。
3. 采用技术以实现活性成分表面浓度更高的支撑颗粒。

为了避免高碳沉积和副反应，脱氢催化剂的化学组成必须防止碳积累，并确保对由重碳材料引起的焦化的稳定性。铂改性剂在选择性减弱铂-烯烃相互作用的同时，不干扰铂-烷烃相互作用中起关键作用。SMART过程引入了氧化预热，通过选择性燃烧氢气，从而减少蒸汽消耗并使反应平衡向苯乙烯单体的生成倾斜。氧化预热催化剂必须能够选择性地燃烧氢气，保持稳定而不需要再生，并且不会对压力降产生不利影响。

答案：轻烯烃，包括丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们在聚合物、塑料、溶剂和燃料的生产中有着广泛的应用。通过催化脱氢合成烯烃面临的热力学挑战需要在高温（高于600°C）和低压（低于30 psig）条件下进行。催化剂设计专注于减少扩散阻力并确保在工艺条件下保持化学稳定性。催化脱氢与选择性氢氧化的耦合可以显著提高平衡转化率，同时保持高选择性。铂改性剂和氧化预热催化剂在这一过程中是关键的，需要特定的设计标准以确保最佳性能和稳定性。
