[1] "The isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons on acidic catalysts such as silica-alumina has been extensively studied and the mechanisms of these reactions involve carbonium ions as intermediates."

[2] "On platinum films, another type of skeletal realTangement also takes place: 2,3-di- methylbutane is formed from the hexanes, and benzene from methylcyelopentane."

[3] "Very large amounts of 2,3-dimethylbutane were formed on platinum films."

[4] "A strong downwards curvature of the plots was probably due to the fast deactivation of the platinum film."

[5] "It is noticeable that isomerization takes place under the experimental conditions where the nonselective mechanism of hydrogenolysis is significant, i.e., on a 0.2% platinum-alumina catalyst, where this mechanism is the only one operating."

[6] "A strong electron donation to the metal in these species would explain an electron deficiency in the molecule and a weakening of the bonds similar to that determining the skeletal rearrangement in carbonium ions."

1. The mechanisms of isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons involve carbonium ions as intermediates when catalyzed by acidic catalysts such as silica-alumina.

2. Platinum films exhibit additional isomerization processes, converting hexanes into 2,3-dimethylbutane and methylcyclopentane into benzene.

3. Large quantities of 2,3-dimethylbutane were produced on platinum films.

4. The strong downward curvature of the plots might indicate rapid catalyst deactivation during reactions.

5. Isomerization occurs under conditions where the nonselective hydrogenolysis mechanism is dominant, specifically on a 0.2% platinum-alumina catalyst.

6. The presence of an electron deficiency and weakened bonds in the molecules can be explained by strong electron donation to the metal in certain species.
