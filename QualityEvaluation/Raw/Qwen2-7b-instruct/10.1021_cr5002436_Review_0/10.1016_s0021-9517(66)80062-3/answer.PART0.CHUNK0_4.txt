[1] "The isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons on acidic catalysts such as silica-alumina has been extensively studied and the mechanisms of these reactions involve carbonium ions as intermediates."
[2] "However, platinum-on-alumina catalysts are active in these reactions at very low temperatures (280C), where the acidic properties of the carrier are doubtful."
[3] "Very little attention has been paid to a possible catalytic effect of the metal itself in the isomerization."
[4] "On platinum films, another type of skeletal rearrangement also takes place: 2,3-di- methylbutane is formed from the hexanes, and benzene from methylcyclopentane."
[5] "Aromatization occurs under the same conditions as isomerization and will also be considered; it will also be interesting to examine the part played by the metal in this reaction, since the mechanism of aromatization is often taken as an example of a dual mechanism."

1.Isomerization typically involves carbonium ions as intermediates in reactions on acidic catalysts like silica-alumina, but at low temperatures, platinum-on-alumina catalysts show activity despite uncertain acidic carrier properties. There's limited focus on the metal's direct catalytic role in isomerization processes.

2.On platinum films, besides isomerization, a distinct type of skeletal rearrangement occurs, leading to the formation of 2,3-dimethylbutane from hexanes and benzene from methylcyclopentane.

3.Aromatization happens under the same conditions as isomerization, and its mechanism is often considered a dual process. It's intriguing to explore how the metal influences this reaction.

1.在酸性催化剂如硅铝酸盐上，异构化通常涉及碳正离子作为中间体。但在较低温度下，铂-氧化铝催化剂显示出活性，尽管载体的酸性性质存在疑问。对于金属直接催化异构化过程的作用关注较少。

2.在铂薄膜上，除了异构化外，还发生一种独特的骨架重组，从己烷生成2,3-二甲基丁烷，并从甲基环戊烷生成苯。

3.芳构化在与异构化相同条件下发生，其机制往往被视为双机制的例子。有趣的是探究金属在这次反应中的作用，因为芳构化机制通常被看作是双机制的一个例子。
