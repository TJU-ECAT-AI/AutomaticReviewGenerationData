[1] "The isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons on acidic catalysts such as silica-alumina has been extensively studied and the mechanisms of these reactions involve carbonium ions as intermediates."
[2] "However, platinum-on-alumina catalysts are active in these reactions at very low temperatures (280C), where the acidic properties of the carrier are doubtful."
[3] "On platinum films, another type of skeletal rearrangement also takes place: 2,3-di-methylbutane is formed from the hexanes, and benzene from methylcyclopentane."
[4] "The aromatization of acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons takes place under the same conditions as isomerization and will also be considered; it will also be interesting to examine the part played by the metal in this reaction, since the mechanism of aromatization is often taken as an example of a dual mechanism."

The isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons typically involves carbonium ions as intermediates, but at lower temperatures, platinum-on-alumina catalysts become active. On platinum films, additional reactions like the formation of 2,3-di-methylbutane from hexanes and benzene from methylcyclopentane occur. Aromatization processes, similar to isomerization, will also be examined to understand the role of the metal in these reactions, considering that aromatization is often associated with dual mechanisms.

饱和烃的异构化通常涉及碳正离子作为中间体，但在较低温度下，铂-氧化铝催化剂开始活跃。在铂薄膜上，还会发生如从己烷形成2,3-二甲基丁烷和从甲基环戊烷形成苯等反应。将研究芳构化过程，这些过程类似于异构化，以理解金属在这类反应中的作用，考虑到芳构化通常是双机制的一个例子。
