JOUnNAL oF CATALYSIS 5, 428-446 (1966) The Mechanisms of Hydrogenolysis and Isomerization of Hydrocarbons on Metals
II. Mechanisms of Isomerization of Hexanes on Platinum Catalysts
Y. BARRON, G. MAIRE, J. M. MULLER, AD F. G. GAULT
From the Department of Chemistry, Universitd de Caen, Caen, France Received July 8, 1965; revised September 28, 1965 The isomerization of n-hexane (I), 2-methylpentane (II), and 3-methylpentane (III) were studied on various supported platinum catalysts, and the initial product distribu- tions compared and identified with Che initial distributions of the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane.
These results suggest that a common cyclopentane intermediate is involved in both reactions, adsorbed on the metal sites of the catalysts. The absence of 2,3-dimethylbutane in the product distributions, the simultaneous dehydroeyclization of (I), (II), and (III) to methylcyclopentane, and the difficulty of isomerizing the 2,3-dimethylbutane under the same conditions, are consistent with the proposed mechanism.
On platinum films, another type of skeletal realTangement also takes place: 2,3-di- methylbutane is formed from the hexanes, and benzene from methylcyelopentane. The mechanism probably involves a species adsorbed on two carbon atoms in the a,7 positions and is very similar in its effects to a carbonium ion mechanism.
Only aromatization occurs when 1,1,3-trimethylcyclopentane reacts with hydrogen on a platinum film at 300C, and that is a further proof of the possibility of ring enlarge- ment on metal catalysts.
INTRODUCTION
The isomerization of saturated hydro- carbons on acidic catalysts such as silica- alumina has been extensively studied and the mechanisms of these reactions involve carbonium ions as intermediates. Similar reactions take place at a much lower tem- perature, when a metal has been deposited on these acidic catalysts. It is widely believed that on these "dual-function" catalysts, the only part played by the metal is to dehy- drogenate the saturated hydrocarbons to olefins which are then isomerized, via car- bonium intermediates, on the acidic sites.
So, very little attention has been paid to a possible catalytic effect of the metal itself in the isomerization.
However, platinum-on-alumina catalysts are active in these reactions at very low temperatures
(280C),
where the acidic properties of the carrier are doubtful. On the other hand, Anderson and Baker have shown that isomerization of acyclic hydro- carbons (butanes, neopentane) may occur on metal films (1, 2).
In a preliminary note in this journal (3),we gave some arguments in favor of a mechanism of isomerization of hexanes in- volving cyclopentane intermediates adsorbed on the platinum itself. Since then the mecha- nisms of hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes have been studied (4) and we are now able to develop this idea, by relating the isomeriza- tion of hexanes to the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane on various supported platinum catalysts and on platinum films.
The aromatization of acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons takes place under the same conditions as isomerization and will also be considered; it will also be interesting to examine the part played by the metal in this reaction, since the mechanism of aro- matization is often taken as an example of a dual mechanism. 428

EXPERIMENTAL
Apparatus The reactions on evaporated films were studied with a static system; the connection of the reaction vessel (200 cc) to the source of a mass spectrometer, as described by Kemball (5), enabled following the reaction without any interruption; at the end of the run, the reaction mixture was trapped away and analyzed by gas chromatography. The standard reaction mixture was 6 torr of hydrocarbon and 60 tort of hydrogen.
In the experiments on supported catalysts,a microcatalytic reactor was employed, in conjunction with a gas-liquid chromatograph using hydrogen as carrier gas. The technique has been described elsewhere (4). The product distribution was reproducible within 4-3%, and the overall conversion within 4-10% over a long period of time (several weeks), on any supported catalysts, except on dispersed platinum-alumina catalysts (0.2-1%). When brought to a temperature of 300C and above, the latter catalysts are slowly deactivated and the product dis- tributions modified in both reactions of methylcyclopentane hydrogenolysis and hex- ane isomerization (4)- When pumice was used as a carrier, in- stead of alumina, the section of the micro- reactor had to be multiplied by a factor of 3 and the amount of catalyst by a factor of 10, so that the same temperature range could be used for the isomerization on platinum- pumice and platinum-alumina. Thus there is an apparent difference of activity between the two catalysts. This difference represents,in fact, a difference in the adsorptive prop- erties of the carriers: It was found that hydrocarbons, when passed through the same mieroreaetor and the same amount of solid, with a same flow rate of hydrogen,stayed 120 times longer on alumina than on pumice.
Catalysts The method of evaporating the platinum films has been previously described (5); the supported platinum catalysts have been prepared according to Pines, Olberg, and Ipatieff (6).
Platinum wire was spec. pure sample from Johnson Matthey; pure grade platinum chloride and , alumina were obtained from,respectively, Caplain-St-Andr6 and Woelm.
Materials 3-Methylpentane and methylcyclopentane were prepared from MEK and cyclopen- tanone by condensation with the appro- priate Grignard reagent, dehydration, and hydrogenation. Methyl isobutyl ketone was reduced to 2-methylpeutane according to Huang-Minlon (7). 2,3-dimethylbutane, 2,2- dimethylbutane, and n-hexane of a high purity were obtained from Fluka.
The preparation of 1,1,3 trimethylcyclo- pentane has been previously described (8).
Any hydrocarbon was purified by gas chromatography before use and, in the ex- periments on platinum films, outgassed and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cylinder hydrogen was purified on platinum-alumina catalysts (supported catalysts) or diffused through a palladium thimble (platinum films).
Gas Chromatography In the microreaetor technique, hydrogen was used as carrier gas and a conductivity cell as detector; the pressure at the entrance of the column and in the microreaetor was 1 atm, the depression 60 cm of mercury. The reaction mixture removed from the static system was analyzed using a flame-ionization detector and nitrogen as carrier gas; the pressure at the entrance of the column was then 1.4 to 1.8 arm, according to the column used.
The five hexanes, methylcyclopentane,and benzene were well resolved on a 5-m silicone oil column at room temperature, but cyclopentane could not be separated from 2,3-dimethylbutane under these conditions.
A 5-m glutaronitrile propylene carbonate column (1I) was used to resolve both hydro- carbons, whenever they were present in the reaction mixture, i.e., in isomerization of hexanes on films; the retention times of the cyclic hydrocarbons were very high on this column, and it could be checked that 2,3- dimethylbutane and not eyelopentane was formed in the reaction. The separation of the 430

three xylenes and toluene was performed on a 5-m Bentone column (9).
Mass Spectrometrical Analysis a. In the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclo- pentane. On platinum films at 270C,the five isomeric hexanes, benzene, and hydrocarbons of lower molecular weight were formed; small amounts of hexenes and methylcyclopentenes were also present in the reaction mixture at higher temperatures,in equilibrium with the corresponding paraf- fins and, in the analytical data, they were included in the per cents of the correspond- ing saturated hydrocarbons.
Ions at masses 86, 84, and 78 were used to determine the amounts of hexanes, methyl- cyclopentane, and benzene at any time. The sensitivities were determined by comparing the mass spectrum of the reaction mixture at the end of the reaction, with its gas chromatographic analysis, performed after hydrogenation of the small amounts of olefins present. Thus the per cent of total hexanes, methylcyclopentane, and benzene in the gas phase were known at any time,provided that the distributions of the hexanes remained constant throughout the reaction; the error introduced with this assumption was estimated at less than 2%.
An attempt was made to analyze the five hexanes continuously using various frag- ments; unfortunately, it was found that the fragmentation for a hexane isomer changed in the presence of the other four, so that the analysis could not be performed by solving a system of linear equations. b. In isomerization of 2-mcthylpentane,3-methylpentane, and n-hexane. The four other hexanes, methylcyclopentane, benzene (and small amounts of hexenes and methyl- cyclopentenes) were formed in isomerization.
Benzene and mcthylcyclopentane were ann- lyzed by the ions at masses 78 and 84, after corrections for the hexenes parent peaks and the second fragment of the hexanes.
In one experiment of isomerization of 3-methylpentane, the amounts of isomeric hexanes were determined at any time by using the ions at masses 71 and 86: At the end of the run, the reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography; the rela- tive ionic abundances at masses 86 and 71 for the mixture of isomerized hexanes could thus be calculated and the sensitivities of this mixture relative to 3-methylpentane determined by comparing the mass spectra and gas chromatographic analysis of the final reaction mixture. In this case again, it was supposed that the distribution of the isomerized hexanes was independent of time,and this assumption introduced an error of 1% to 5% in the analysis.

In the same conditions, any of these three hexanes gave the other two by isomerization and was simultaneously dehydrocyclized to methylcyclopentane.
Less than 2% of 2,3-dimethylbutane was formed in both reactions. Cracking to hydro- carbons of lower molecular weight and dehydrocyclization to benzene also occurred,especially at higher temperatures.

The isomerization of n-hexane (I) will be characterized by the ratio r' = x2/x3 of the two main reaction products; similarly, r'2 = x/x will be en- visaged in the isomerization of (II), and r'3 = x2/x in that of (III). Thus the ratios r, r2, r3, obtained in hydrogenolysis will be compared to the ratios r'3 = x2/x, r'2 = x3/xl, r'l = x2/x3 obtained in the isomeriza- tion of, respectively, n-hexane (I), 2 methyl- pentane (II), and 3 methylpentane (III).
1. Comparison for the Same Contact
Time In the first series of experiments the three hexanes (I), (II), (III), and methylcyclo- pentane were successively passed on the same amount of a 1% platinum-alumina catalyst, under the same flow conditions. The product distributions were thus compared for the same contact time; varying the r / 3 ." 2 oe )ib " / / / / i 2 5 r' la temperature of the microreactor varied the conversion and the product distributions.For every experiment at a given tempera- ture, the ratios r'l, r', r'3 obtained in isomeri- zation of hexanes, were very close to the ratios rl, r2, r3 obtained in the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane. Such an experiment is represented in an XOY diagram (Fig. la) by three plots: X1 = r'l, I71 = rl; X2 = r', Y2 = r2; X3 = r'3, Y3 = r3. All the plots,corresponding to various temperatures be- tween 269 and 325C, are grouped near the biseetrix in the diagram.Figures lb and lc represent similar experi- ments on 10% platinum-alumina (286- 360C) and on 10% platinum-pumice (270- 345C). It is of interest that the product distributions, though widely varying from one catalyst to another, and especially from a 1% to a 10% platinum-alumina catalyst are very close in isomerization and hydro- r 3 2 l / /' / / ,6 .g o /

433 ratios are obtained by extrapolation of the curves r = f(p) and r = f(p'). It is quite clear that the initial distribution in any isomerization reaction is the same as the corresponding initial distribution obtained in hydrogenolysis, though the initial slopes of the curves are very different for both reactions.This initial distribution of hydrogenolysis approximately corresponds to an equal chance for breaking the five cyclic bonds:h = 2.15; r = 0.55; r3 = 1.1.The dashed lines in the figures represent the equilibrium values for rl, r2, r8 deter- mined experimentally (10).It must be noticed that the initial ratios are very different from the equilibrium ones. iV[ethylcyclopentane was formed during the isomerization of all three hexanes.Figure 3 represents the variations of the mole fractions a - x4/Zx of methylcyclopentane with the conversions. Though the experi- mental errors were large, because of the small size of the peaks of methylcyclopentane in the chromatograms,it is clear that methylcyclopentane goes through a maxi- mum when the conversion is increased.Apparently the plots a = g(p') correspond- ing to the isomerization of the three hexanes are grouped on the same curve.The initial distributions for hydrogenolysis and sometimes for isomerization were deter- mined at different temperatures. They are reported in Table 1: It can be seen that the 20

product distribution does not vary much with temperature in the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane, and this confirms a similar result obtained in the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclobutane on the same catalyst (4;). On the other hand, the distributions in hydrogenolysis and isomerization, when de- termined, were identical.
The initial slope of the curve rl = f(p) (hydrogenolysis) is also reported in the table,for various temperatures. It increases with temperature. b. I0N Platinum on alumina. It seemed of interest to repeat the preceding experi- ments on another supported catalyst; the 10% platinum-on-alumina catalyst was then chosen because the product distributions of hydrogenolysis (and of isomerization) ob- tained on this catalyst were very different from these obtained on a 0.2% platinum- alumina catalyst.
The variations with conversions of the different ratios r and r' are represented in Figs. 4a to 4e. Here again the initial distribu- tions in isomerization and hydrogenolysis are identical. The initial distribution of hydrogenolysis is substantially different from the distribution obtained on a 0.2% platinum-alumina catalyst: rl = 3.5; r2 =

435 On 10% platinum-alumina, methyleyclo- pentae was formed only in a very small amount (less than 1%) and could not be accurately determined.
3. Side Reactions: Isomerization to 2,3-Di-
methylbutane and Extensive Crac]cing Very small amounts of 2,3 dimethyl- butane, 1% to 2% of the total reaction products, were formed during hydrogenolysis and isomerization on any supported cata- lysts. These amounts do not seem to vary much with temperature and conversion.
Cracking to hydrocarbons of lower molec- ular weight occurs on any catalyst; for example,on a
0.2% platinum-alumina
catalyst, at the lower reaction temperatures,less than 1% of the total reaction products from isohexanes was present as hydrocar- bons in the C1-C range; their amounts increased with temperature and reached 40% at 340C. Among these products,n-pentane and isopentane were the major ones, but n- and isobutanes, propane, ethane,and methane were also present.
In Figs. 5a and 5b, n-pentane and iso- and isopentane are not initially formed in hydrogenolysis, but in a secondary reaction,presumably the cracking of the hexanes. On the contrary, both pentanes are formed initially from 2-methyl- and 3-methyl- pentanes. Similarly, n-pentane is the major cracking product from n-hexane; but Fig. 5b shows that isopentane is also formed initially to a smaller extent. The initial ratio n-pen- tane over isopentane (s) was determined by extrapolation in the cracking of n-hexane and was equal to 5 4- 0.5. The same ratio was 1.2 and 0.3 in the cracking of, respec- tively, 2-methyl- and 3-methylpentanes.
The two latter figures can be interpreted by supposing that the rates of cracking of a secondary-primary Ctt2-CHa bond, vl, and of a tertiary-primary bond, v, are in the ratios 1:0.6. In the cracking of 2-methyl- pentane indeed, s = 2 v2/vl, while in the cracking of 3-methylpentane, s = w./2 vl.
3. Isomerization of 2,3-Dimethylbutane

On the contrary, isomerization of 3-meth- ylpentane was noticeable even at 277C and at temperatures higher than 340C the hexane distributions were very close to the equilibrium distribution among (I), (II),and (III).

Isomerization of 3-methylpentane is expressed in per cent as 100[(xi + x2)/(xl + x2 + x3)]. Isomerization of 2,3-dimethylbutane is expressed as [9 x/(xl + x2 + x + xs)] 100, xl, x, x, x5 being the concentrations of n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, 2,3 dimethylbutane; cracking is expressed as per cent of pentane or isopentane in the C5 + C+ hydrocarbon mixture.
Table 2 summarizes the results of these experiments.
On a 10% platinum-on-alumina cata- lyst, similar results were obtained. The isomerization of 2,3-dimethylbutane, mainly to 2-methylpentane, was very small, when compared to the isomerization of 3-methyl- pentane. However, for the same tempera- ture, the extent of isomerization of 2,3- dimethylbutane was smaller on a 0.2% platinum-alumina catalyst than on a 10% platinum-alumina catalyst.
5. Isomerization on Alumina
The activity of the carrier was tested for the isomerization of methyleyelopentene molecular weight hydrocarbons could only be detected at 350C (1.5%) and was smaller than 3% at 400C; cracking to hexenes and isomerization to cyclohexenes were not observed up to 450C. b. Isohexenes. Only double-bond shifts took place, when 2-methylpent-l-ene and 3-methylpent-2-ene were passed over alu- mina up to 380C. At 390C, less than 2% of skeletal rearrangement occurred,and 14-16% at 450C; on the other hand, isom- erization on alumina appeared to be more selective on alumina than on platinum- alumina, under these conditions: for exam- ple, mainly 2-methylpentenes were obtained from 3-methylpent-2-ene.

The isomerization of 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane were studied at 270C, the isomerization of n-hexane at 270C and
330C. The five hexane isomers, methyl-
cyclopentane, and benzene were obtained in any experiment. The amounts reported in Table 3 of these hydrocarbons were obtained Fig. 6 the per cent of hexane isomers, methyl- eyclopentane, and benzene obtained from 3-methylpentane are plotted versus time,together with the per cent of 3 methyl- pentane. All three of these products are formed initially. The strong downwards curvature of the plots was probably due to the fast deactivation of the platinum film.
Apparently the film is not so poisoned for the aromatization as for the dehydrocycliza- tion to methylcyclopentane.

a The product distributions are expressed as per cent of the total Cs reaction products. after 4 hr of reaction. After such a reaction time, the platinum films were entirely de- activated. The extent of deactivation de- pended widely upon the starting material,and that explains the large range in the conversions obtained with the different hydrocarbons.
Very large amounts of 2,3-dimethylbutane were formed on platinum films. The presence of 2,2-dimethylbutane was ascertained by the retention time in chromatography on a silicone oil column, correct within 0.5%,and by the mass spectra, after gas chroma- tographic separation.
The kinetics of the formation of methyl- eyclopentane and benzene were followed in every run. The ratios r' of the initial rates for the formation of benzene and methyl- cyclopentane is much larger in the reactions of n-hexane (0.22) than in those of 2-methyl- and 3 methylpentanes (0.7 X 10-2); it does not seem to depend upon temperature.The kinetics of isomerization was only followed in the case of 3-methylpentane. In
2. Hydrogenolysis of Methylcyclopentane
The contact reactions of methylcyclo- pentane on platinum films were studied at 272 and 327C; the opening of the cyclo- pentane ring mainly gives 2-methylpentane,3-methylpentane,and n-hexane;2,3-di- methylbutane and benzene were also present iu the reaction products.
In the last two columns of Table 3, the gas chromatographic analysis at 272 and 327 of the C6 reaction products (hexanes and benzene) is given; the amounts of vari- ous hydrocarbons are expressed as the per cent of the total C6 reaction products.
In Figs. 7a and 7b, the per cent of hexane isomers and benzene are plotted versus time.
From these plots it can be seen that benzene is ahvays obtained as an initial reaction product; the higher the temperature, the higher is the rate of formation of benzene.
These plots show a strong downwards curva- ture, and that is a consequence of the very fast loss of activity of the catalyst during the reaction (2). 438

However, it is noticeable that at 330 the ratio of benzene to total hexanes in the final analysis (0.35) is higher than the initial ratio (0.15). So the deactivation of the catalyst is faster for hydrogenolysis than for aromati- zation. This also explains the differences between the curvatures of the hexane and benzene plots in Fig. 7b; the comparison between the rates of aromatization of n-hexane and methylcyclopentane excluded the explanation of this effect by a reaction of the n-hexane formed in hydrogenolysis.
The amounts of 2,3-dimethylbutane ob- tained on platinum films, although small,were four to six times bigger than the amounts obtained on supported catalysts;that could be due to a further isomerization of the reaction products, since the analysis was done at 20% conversion.
The distributions in 2-methylpentane,3-methylpentane, and n-hexane related in Table 3 were similar, but not exactly iden- tical in hydrogenolysis and isomerization.
Thus the ratio x2/x was 2.41 and 1.51 in the isomerization of hexanes at 270 and 330 ,
1.92 and 1.72 in the hydrogenolysis of
methyleyclopentane at the same tempera- tures. The agreement is better for the ratio x2/xl obtained from 3-methylpentane (6.15) and from methylcyclopentane (4.98). How- ever, it must be kept in mind that the initial distributions could not be obtained, for the mass spectrometrical analysis of the five hexane isomers was not possible.
8. Aromatization of 1,l ,3-Trimethylcyclopen-
tane The contact reactions of 1,1,3-trimethyl- cyclopentane (VI) were studied on platinum film at 300 and 330C. The course of the reaction was continuously followed using the mass spectrometer. A fast equilibration of (VI) and the corresponding cyclic olefins was reached within the first 2 rain of reac- tion. Less than 1% of saturated acyclic hydrocarbons were formed throughout the reaction.
On the contrary xylenes appeare d right at the very beginning of the runs, and were the main reaction products; small amounts of toluene were also formed, as initial reac- tion product.
According to the gas chromatographic analysis, the aromatics present in the final reaction mixture at 18% conversion, con- sisted of toluene (19%), meta-xylene (53%),and para-xylene (28%); no ortho-xylene could be detected.
)ISCUSSION
A. Isomerization on Supported
Platinum Catalysts The first question which arises is whether isomerization takes place on the metal sites of the supported catalysts, or on the acidic sites of the carrier, via a carbonium ion mechanism.
It has already been shown that the hydro- genolysis of cyclic hydrocarbons takes place on metal and not on acidic sites in supported platinum catalysts (4). Since isomerization and hydrogenolysis are connected, for exam- ple, in the reaction products on various catalysts, apparently isomerization also takes place on metal sites.
The following observations substantiate this statement:(1) The initial product distributions of isomerization of methylpentanes and n-hexane on platinum-alumina catalysts are very different from the distributions HYDROCARBONS ON METALS ii. 439 () .

and aromatization of methyleyelopentane on platinum films at 272C (Fig. 7a) and 327C (Fig. 7b): O, hexanes; A, benzene. obtained on acidic catalysts; for example,the primary products of isomerization of 2-methylpentane or 3-methylpentane on aluminum chloride are only the other methylpentane and 2,3-dimethylbutane; on the other hand, the primary products from n-hexane are 2-methylpentane, 3-methyl- pentane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane in nearly the same proportions as found in equilibrium (12, 13). The initial product distributions obtained on the various platinum-alumina catalysts from methylpentanes and n-hexane were very different from these distributions and from the equilibrium one; n-hexane was always found as a primary product from any hydrocarbon, and 2,3-dimethylbutane was never formed in appreciable amount.
(2) The rates of isomerization of methyl- pentanes and n-hexane on platinum-alumina are very similar and much larger than the rate of isomerization of 2,3-dimethylbutane;on the contrary, on an acidic catalyst the rate of isomerization of this latter hydro- carbon to 2-methylpentane is larger than the rate of isomerization of 2-methylpentane to n-hexane (12).
(3) The acidity of the carrier in supported platinum catalysts does not seem to be essen- tial for isomerization, in our experiments.
When the differences of adsorptive prop- erties are taken into account, isomerization takes place in the same range of temperature on platinum-charcoal, platinum-pumice, and platinum-alumina; it is also noticeable that similar distributions were obtained on these three catalysts. 440
BARRON, MAIRE, MULLER, AND GAULT
(4) If platinum-alumina, under our con- ditions, was operating as a dual-function catalyst, reaction (1) should be proposed for isomerization, e.g., of 3-methylpentane. Such a scheme is ruled out by the fact that alu- mina does not catalyze the isomerization of acyclic olefins below 400C, while isomeriza- tion on platinum-alumina takes place at
280C. Therefore, for all these reasons, we
believe that isomerization takes place on the metal sites of platinum-alumina and other supported platinum catalysts. faster than isomerization, which has bee verified.
The intermediate C in this scheme repre- sents a number of adsorbed species in inter- conversion. One or more of these species necessarily has a cyclopentane structure;that is proved by the absence of 2,3-di- methylbutane in the isomerization products and by the fact that it is difficult to isomerize this hydrocarbon oil platinum-alumina cata- lysts under the same conditions. 2,3-Di- methylbutane can be dehydroeyclized only

Az 03 A second question which arises is the nature of the intermediate species in isomer- ization. On platinum-Mumina catalysts, the product distributions in hydrogenolysis of methyleyelopentane and in isomerization of hexanes widely varied with the concentra- tion of the metal on the carrier. These varia- tions were the same in both reacti0ils.
Furthermore, the initial distributions in isomerization and in hydrogenolysis were identical. This identity dearly shows that a common intermediate is involved in both reactions, on supported platinum catalysts.
That is confirmed by the fact that de- hydroeylization to methylcyclopentane ac- companies tile isomerization of hexanes.
Scheme 1 summarizes the relationships between isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and dehydroeyclization. Isomerization of n-hex- ane, for instance, is represented by the consecutive elementary steps 1-31 or 1-2t;its dehydrocyclization by the reactions 1-41;hydrogenolysis of methylcyelopentane by any of the steps 4-Y, 4-21, 4-3'. The maxi- mum in methylcyclopentane formation dur- ing isomerization is consistent with this mechanism provided that hydrogenolysis is via a cyclobutane intermediate, which is not likely to occur under these eonditions.The intermediate species in the dehydro-
(D
() () Scheme I cyclization of hexanes are also intermediates in the reverse reaction, i.e., in the hy- drogenolysis of methylcyclopentane. The mechanisms of hydrogenolysis of methyl- eyelopentane on platinum catalysts have been studied in a previous paper (4). Accord- ing to the concentration of platinum on the carrier and the experimental conditions,three mechanisms had to be considered.

ON METALS II.
441 Among these mechanisms, one corresponded to an equal chance of rupturing the five cyclic bonds of methyleyelopentane. Since ditertiary CH--CH bonds were opened according to this mechanism, and since cis-trans equilibrium of disubstituted cyclo- pentanes was reached during hydrogenolysis,it was suggested that afl,, triadsorbed species were responsible for this type of cracking; these species were shown to be r-bonded to the metal and to cause inversion of the carbon atom (1, 15).
It is noticeable that isomerization takes place under the experimental conditions where the nonselective mechanism of hydro- genolysis is significant, i.e., on a 0.2% plati- num-alumina catalyst, where this mechanism is the only one operating, and on a 100 platinum-alumina catalyst at the tempera- tures where it is becoming important (above
290C) (4).
So it is tempting to assume that the species responsible for isomerization and dehydro- eyclization of hexanes are also the a,,triadsorbed species responsible for this type of hydrogenolysis. The first elementary step of isomerization could thus be described by reaction (2).

energy associated with isomerization is higher than the activation energy of hydro- genolysis, and that explains the increase of the slope r = f(o) with temperature (Table 1).
The fact that the distributions in isomeri- zation and in hydrogenolysis were very close at the same contact times may be the result of a coincidence, since the initial distributions and, of course, the equilibrium distributions are identical for both reactions.
A possible explanation could be that the concentration of the intermediate remains almost constant throughout the course of the reaction.
If the reactions are assumed to be first order versus hydrocarbon, which is strictly true in the ease of hydrogenolysis (4), the following equations can be written:dxi/dt = -lixi + l_ic c being the concentration of the intermedi- ate. Supposing c constant, the integration gives, when i is the starting material,. : (d<#kd + [I - (c;_/dle -. xi = (c/c_j//cj)(1 - e -'t) (j  i)

Such a scheme is similar to that proposed by Sheppard and Rooney to explain the dehydrocyclization of o-methylethylbenzene to indane, and it should be outlined that the results obtained by these authors were a very good confirmation for the proposed cyclic mechanism of isomerization (16).
The variations of the product distributions with conversions correspond to the readsorp- tion and further isomerization of the primary reaction products. These variations were much larger in isomerization than in hydro- genolysis, since the rate of hydrogenolysis is eight to ten times larger than the rate of isomerization, under the experimental condi- tions considered. Similarly, the activation When isomerization of (I) and hydro- genolysis of (IV), for example, are con- sidered, it can be easily checked that rl/r'l equals 1. These equations also show that the same amounts of methyleyelopentane, x4,should be obtained from any of the three hexanes and this has been verified.
B. Isomerization on Platinum Films
The isomerization of hexanes on platinum films is a further proof that this reaction does take place on metals. The distributions iu methylpentanes and n-hexane can be compared in hydrogenolysis and in isomeri- zation on platinum fihns and that shows that the mechanism shown in Scheme 1, impor- 442
BARRON, IAIRE, MULLER
AND GAULT
rant on supported catalysts, also occurs on platinum films.
However, these distributions are not strictly identical and it is therefore necessary to introduce another mechanism of isomeri- zation. Some other facts are in favor of such a mechanism: The large amounts of 2,3- dimethylbutane in the product distributions of isomerization cannot be explained by the cyclic mechanism. On the other hand, Anderson and Baker have shown that isobutaae and neopentane can be isomerized on platinum films (1, 2); the reverse reaction of isomerization at a quaternary carbon atom also occurs on platinum films: small amounts of 2,2-dimethylbutane are formed from hexanes. In all these reactions, cyclo- pentane intermediates cannot be formed and another mechanism should be considered.
The species associated with this mecha- nism could be strongly adsorbed on two carbon atoms in the a,7 positions. That is suggested by the fact that gem-disubstituted alkanes are isomerized by this mechanism.
It was recently suggested that a,a,7 tri- adsorbed species were involved in the demethylation of polymethylcyclopentanes on cobalt films, for, when the reaction was studied in presence of deuterium, four deuterium atoms were present in the de- methylated molecule (17). On the other hand a,a,7,7 tetraadsorbed species can be formed on platinum, and their existence was shown in the hydrogenolysis of substituted cyclo- propane hydrocarbons (18). If similar species do intervene Scheme 2 can be proposed for the second type of isomerization: The a,c,7,7 species described in these schemes are believed to be (d-p) -bonded to the metal atoms (17).
A strong electron donation to the metal in these species would explain an electron deficiency in the molecule and a weakening of the bonds similar to that determining the skeletal rearrangement in carbonium ions.
In fact, such a mechanism is,at least in its effects, very similar to a carboniumion mechanism [reaction (3),top of next page].
However,this mechanism is not truly a carbonium ion mechanism, since it occurs on platinum films and not on platinum-alumina catalysts, where carbonium ions are more likely to be formed.
On the other hand, the proposed mecha- nism in Scheme 2 is very similar to the one proposed by Csicsery and Pines to explain the aromatization on Cr203-A1203 of labeled 2,2,3- and 2,3,4-trimethylpentanes (19, 20).
These authors explain their results by the consecutive formation and hydrogenolysis of a cyclopropane intermediate. The pro- posed mechanism involves the same kind of concept, but has the advantage of not intro- ducing an adsorbed cyclopropane species,which cannot be formed on metal surfaces.
C. Aromatization
The formation of benzene from methyl- cyclopentane and from 3-methylpentane may occur according to one of the mecha- nisms given in Schemes 1' and 2', which closely correspond to the two mechanisms of isomerization. According to the first mech-

Such a mechanism would explain the initial formation of benzene from iso- hexanes and methylcyclopentane. According to a second mechanism (Scheme 20, a direct enlargement of the cyclopentane ring would occur on the metal surface. This mechanism involves the same adsorbed species than the isomerization to 2,3-dimethylbutane. It is very close to the mechanism of isomerization of methylcyclopentane on acidic catalysts [reactiun (4), above], but involves poly- adsorbed species, and not carbonium ions.To chose between these two proposed mechanisms, 1' and 2 r, is difficult indeed,but the fact that the extent of aromatization is larger on platinum films, where 2,3-di- methylbutane is formed in isomerization,than on platinum-alumina catalysts, seems c @c Cc I  'c c c C c

c (4) to be in favor of the second mechanism, i.e.,the enlargement of the methylcyclopentane ring.
On the other hand a third mechanism has to be introduced to explain the very large amounts of benzene formed from normal hexane. This mechanism of aromatization involves probably a 1-6 ring closure, and was introduced by I-Ierrington and Rideal (21),to explain the aromatization of larger paraffins.
Only toluene and not xylenes should be obtained in the aromatization of 1,1,3-tri- methylcyclopentane by the mechanism in- volving the opening of the ring (1'), since the hydrogenolysis of gem-disubstituted eyelopentanes only affects the bonds be- tween secondary and tertiary carbon atoms (22, 23). 444

Mechanism 1" Moreover, the hydrogenolysis of 1,1,3 trimethylcyclopentane is very slight on platinum films; that excludes the possibility of mechanism 1', even for the formation of toluene. Thus the aromatization of the tri- methylcyclopentane may occur only through a ring enlargement, and that is a definite proof of the existence of this mechanism (2').The complete absence of ortho-xylene ex- cludes a carbonium ion mechanism and direct formation of isopentane from n-hexane on this catalyst involves a more complicated mechanism of reaction. Here again, two different mechanisms could be considered:either an extensive cracking after dehydro- cyclization to a cyclopentane intermediate (5), or an extensive cracking after isomeriza- tiou according to the second mechanism of isomerization (6).Since isopentane was not initially formed from methyleyelopentane, we prefer the !7 i" M

D. Extensive Cracking
The mechanism of cracking of hexanes to hydrocarbons of lower molecular weight mostly involves species adsorbed on two adjacent carbon atoms. It was therefore possible to compare the rates of cracking of tertiary-primary and secondary-primary bonds in two different isohexanes. But the second scheme to explain this type of exten- sive cracking.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, there are at least two dif- ferent mechanisms of isomerization operat- ing on platinum catalysts. One of these involves a cyclic intermediate; the other one, involving a alkyl shift, is velsz similar to an acidic-type mechanism. Aromatization also occurs in the same conditions and probably through a ring enlargement.
These reactions occur on both supported

Since these latter reactions are also occurring on acidic catalysts, via a carbonium ion mechanism, we believe that one should be very careful about the role of the metal in dual-function catalysts. There is no doubt that the carrier plays an important part in isomerization and ring enlargement on plat- forming catalysts, under operating condi- tions, i.e.,at temperatures much higher than those used in our experiments. But, even under these conditions, the platinum cer- tainly catalyzes by itself for a large part isomerization and aromatization, and cannot be considered as a simple hydrogenating- dehydrogenating agent.
Since the metal appears to play such an important part in hydrocarbon reactions on platinum catalysts at high temperatures, it would now be interesting to compare the catalytic activity of this metal with the activity of the other Group VIII metals;some work is in progress in this direction.
