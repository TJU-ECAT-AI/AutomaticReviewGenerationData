[1] "The aromatization of acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons takes place under the same conditions as isomerization and will also be considered; it will also be interesting to examine the part played by the metal in this reaction, since the mechanism of aro- matization is often taken as an example of a dual mechanism."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Aromatic hydrocarbon formation occurs under the same conditions as isomerization and will also be discussed. It will also be interesting to investigate the metal's role in this process, as aromaticization is commonly viewed as a dual mechanism example.
