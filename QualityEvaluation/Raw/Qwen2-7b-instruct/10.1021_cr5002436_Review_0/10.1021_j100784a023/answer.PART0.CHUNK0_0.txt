[5] "The agreement is good for the Pt/SiO2 catalyst but only fair for the Pt/A12O3 catalyst."
[6] "While the degree of dispersion of the platinum may be different on alumina and silica, the difference in apparent activation energies cannot be rationalized readily on the basis of a difference in platinum surface areas alone."

The hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts shows that the rate of hydrogenolysis to methane increases with ethane partial pressure within a range of 0.7 to 0.9. However, the rate decreases significantly with increasing hydrogen pressure. This behavior can be described by a power law, r = kpE"pHm. The experiments suggest that the initial dehydrogenation step is equilibrated, and the cracking of the C2H adsorbed dehydrogenated radical into surface fragments CH and CH is rate-controlling. The activation energy for the reaction over the silica-supported platinum catalyst is higher compared to the alumina-supported catalyst. This discrepancy suggests that there is a specific interaction between platinum and the support, which affects the catalytic properties differently. The commonly held belief that supports do not interact with noble metals is challenged by these findings.

乙烷在负载铂催化剂上的氢解反应显示，甲烷生成速率随乙烷分压增加而在0.7至0.9的范围内提高。然而，随着氢气分压的增加，速率显著降低。这种行为可以用幂律描述，r = kpE"pHm。实验结果表明，初始脱氢步骤是平衡的，C2H吸附脱氢基团裂解成表面碎片CH和CH是控制步骤。激活能对于硅负载的铂催化剂比氧化铝负载的催化剂更高。这一差异表明，铂与支撑物之间存在特定的相互作用，这影响了催化剂的性质。通常认为支持物不会与贵金属发生相互作用的观点受到这些发现的挑战。
