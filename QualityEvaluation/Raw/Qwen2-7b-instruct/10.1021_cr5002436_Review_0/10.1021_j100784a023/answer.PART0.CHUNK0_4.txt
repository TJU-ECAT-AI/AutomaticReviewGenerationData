These results can be accounted for satisfactorily by the mechanism proposed by Cimino, Boudart, and Tay10r.

The species C2H,represents an adsorbed dehydrogenated radical which reacts with a molecule of hydrogen to form the surface fragments CH, and CH,. The latter are hydrogenated off the surface to form methane. By postulating that the initial dehydrogenation step was an equilibrated re- action and that the cracking of C2H, in the second step mas rate controlling, the authors derived an approxi- mate rate law of the form where 0 < n < 1.

Taking the experimental values of n for the Pt/SiOz and Pt/A12O3 catalysts, and assuming a value for a, we can calculate the exponent (1 - nu) of p and compare with m, the experimental value. The best agreement is obtained if we assume a = 3,in which case the calculated exponents of p for the Pt/SiOz and Pt/A1203 catalysts are, respectively, -
1.7
and -
1.1, which are to be compared with the cor-
responding experimental m values of -
1.8 and -
1.7.
The agreement is good for the Pt/SiOz catalyst but only fair for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

The most interesting finding of the present study is the marked difference in the apparent activation energy for the two platinum catalysts studied. While the degree of dispersion of the platinum may be different on alumina and silica, the difference in apparent acti- vation energies cannot be rationalized readily on the basis of a difference in platinum surface areas alone,since this would be expected to affect only the magni- tudes of the rates rather than the temperature depend- ence. It seems more likely that some specific inter- action between platinum and support is involved. The widely held impression5 that supports do not interact with noble metals is thus open to considerable question.

The document discusses the hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts. It reports that the rate of hydrogenolysis increases with ethane partial pressure but decreases markedly with increasing hydrogen partial pressure. The reaction follows a simple power law, and the exponents of ethane and hydrogen partial pressures (n and m) are derived. The study also finds a significant difference in the apparent activation energy between the Pt/SiOz and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, which is attributed to a specific interaction between platinum and the support. The results support the mechanism proposed by Cimino, Boudart, and Taylor, which explains the reaction steps involving dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes on the catalyst surface.

文献讨论了支持铂催化剂上乙烷的氢解反应。它报告称，随着乙烷分压的增加，氢解速率增加，但随着氢气分压的增加，速率显著降低。反应遵循简单的幂律，从实验数据推导出乙烷和氢气分压的指数（n和m）。研究还发现Pt/SiOz和Pt/Al2O3催化剂的显着活化能差异，这归因于铂与支持物之间的特定相互作用。结果支持Cimino、Boudart和Taylor提出的机制，该机制解释了在催化剂表面上涉及脱氢和氢化过程的反应步骤。
