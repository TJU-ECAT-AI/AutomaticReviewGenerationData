The hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts, specifically silica and alumina supports, was investigated in this study. The rate of hydrogenolysis to methane increased with ethane partial pressure to a power in the range of 0.7 to 0.9. However, the rate decreased significantly with increasing hydrogen pressure. This phenomenon was attributed to a mechanism involving extensive dehydrogenation on the surface prior to a slow step in which carbon-carbon bonds are broken. The apparent activation energy of the reaction was found to be higher over the silica-supported platinum, even though the rates were not vastly different at the temperatures of the study. The difference in activation energies for the different supports suggested that the support interacts with platinum in some manner, with silica differing from alumina regarding such an interaction. The study also revealed that the initial step in the reaction involved dehydrogenation to form unsaturated surface radicals, and the hydrogen content of the radicals varied with the metal. No data were reported for noble metal catalysts in previous studies, leading to the decision to investigate the reaction over supported platinum. This research highlights the importance of considering the effect of the support on the catalytic properties of the platinum.

本研究探讨了在支撑铂催化剂（硅和氧化铝）上进行的乙烷氢解。氢解率随乙烷分压增加而增加，范围为0.7到0.9，但随着氢气分压的增加，速率显著下降。这种现象被归因于表面进行的广泛脱氢步骤，在此之后是缓慢的碳碳键断裂步骤。反应的显着活化能高于硅支持的铂，尽管在研究温度下，速率并未相差甚远。不同支持物之间的差异表明，支持物与铂之间存在某种相互作用，硅与氧化铝在这一点上的行为有所不同。研究还揭示了反应的第一步涉及脱氢形成不饱和表面自由基，自由基中的氢含量随金属变化。先前的研究中未报告过贵金属催化剂的数据，因此决定研究使用支撑铂的反应。这项研究表明考虑支撑物对铂催化性能的影响的重要性。
