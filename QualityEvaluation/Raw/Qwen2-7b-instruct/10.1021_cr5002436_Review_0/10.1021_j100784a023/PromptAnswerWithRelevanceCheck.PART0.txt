The hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts shows that the rate of hydrogenolysis to methane increases with ethane partial pressure within a range of 0.7 to 0.9. However, the rate decreases significantly with increasing hydrogen pressure. This behavior can be described by a power law, r = kpE"pHm. The experiments suggest that the initial dehydrogenation step is equilibrated, and the cracking of the C2H adsorbed dehydrogenated radical into surface fragments CH and CH is rate-controlling. The activation energy for the reaction over the silica-supported platinum catalyst is higher compared to the alumina-supported catalyst. This discrepancy suggests that there is a specific interaction between platinum and the support, which affects the catalytic properties differently. The commonly held belief that supports do not interact with noble metals is challenged by these findings.

The hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts, specifically silica and alumina supports, was investigated in this study. The rate of hydrogenolysis to methane increased with ethane partial pressure to a power in the range of 0.7 to 0.9. However, the rate decreased significantly with increasing hydrogen pressure. This phenomenon was attributed to a mechanism involving extensive dehydrogenation on the surface prior to a slow step in which carbon-carbon bonds are broken. The apparent activation energy of the reaction was found to be higher over the silica-supported platinum, even though the rates were not vastly different at the temperatures of the study. The difference in activation energies for the different supports suggested that the support interacts with platinum in some manner, with silica differing from alumina regarding such an interaction. The study also revealed that the initial step in the reaction involved dehydrogenation to form unsaturated surface radicals, and the hydrogen content of the radicals varied with the metal. No data were reported for noble metal catalysts in previous studies, leading to the decision to investigate the reaction over supported platinum. This research highlights the importance of considering the effect of the support on the catalytic properties of the platinum.

本研究探讨了在支撑铂催化剂（硅和氧化铝）上进行的乙烷氢解。氢解率随乙烷分压增加而增加，范围为0.7到0.9，但随着氢气分压的增加，速率显著下降。这种现象被归因于表面进行的广泛脱氢步骤，在此之后是缓慢的碳碳键断裂步骤。反应的显着活化能高于硅支持的铂，尽管在研究温度下，速率并未相差甚远。不同支持物之间的差异表明，支持物与铂之间存在某种相互作用，硅与氧化铝在这一点上的行为有所不同。研究还揭示了反应的第一步涉及脱氢形成不饱和表面自由基，自由基中的氢含量随金属变化。先前的研究中未报告过贵金属催化剂的数据，因此决定研究使用支撑铂的反应。这项研究表明考虑支撑物对铂催化性能的影响的重要性。

It explains that the reaction rate increases with ethane partial pressure to a power in the range 0.7 to 0.9, but decreases markedly with increasing hydrogen pressure. The apparent activation energy of the reaction is much higher over the silica-supported platinum, suggesting that the support interacts with the platinum in some manner. The study also finds differences in activation energies between the silica and alumina supports, which cannot be explained solely by the difference in platinum surface areas, indicating a specific interaction between platinum and support.

The species C2H,represents an adsorbed dehydrogenated radical which reacts with a molecule of hydrogen to form the surface fragments CH, and CH,. The latter are hydrogenated off the surface to form methane. By postulating that the initial dehydrogenation step was an equilibrated re- action and that the cracking of C2H, in the second step mas rate controlling, the authors derived an approxi- mate rate law of the form where 0 < n < 1.

Taking the experimental values of n for the Pt/SiOz and Pt/A12O3 catalysts, and assuming a value for a, we can calculate the exponent (1 - nu) of p and compare with m, the experimental value. The best agreement is obtained if we assume a = 3,in which case the calculated exponents of p for the Pt/SiOz and Pt/A1203 catalysts are, respectively, -
1.7
and -
1.1, which are to be compared with the cor-
responding experimental m values of -
1.8 and -
1.7.
The agreement is good for the Pt/SiOz catalyst but only fair for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

The most interesting finding of the present study is the marked difference in the apparent activation energy for the two platinum catalysts studied. While the degree of dispersion of the platinum may be different on alumina and silica, the difference in apparent acti- vation energies cannot be rationalized readily on the basis of a difference in platinum surface areas alone,since this would be expected to affect only the magni- tudes of the rates rather than the temperature depend- ence. It seems more likely that some specific inter- action between platinum and support is involved. The widely held impression5 that supports do not interact with noble metals is thus open to considerable question.

The document discusses the hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts. It reports that the rate of hydrogenolysis increases with ethane partial pressure but decreases markedly with increasing hydrogen partial pressure. The reaction follows a simple power law, and the exponents of ethane and hydrogen partial pressures (n and m) are derived. The study also finds a significant difference in the apparent activation energy between the Pt/SiOz and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, which is attributed to a specific interaction between platinum and the support. The results support the mechanism proposed by Cimino, Boudart, and Taylor, which explains the reaction steps involving dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes on the catalyst surface.
