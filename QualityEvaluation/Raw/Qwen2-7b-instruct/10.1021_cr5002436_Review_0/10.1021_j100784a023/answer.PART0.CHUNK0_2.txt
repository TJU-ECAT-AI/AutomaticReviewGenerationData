[1] "The reaction rate measurements were carried out in a flow system at atmospheric pressure."

[5] "The apparent activation energy of the reaction was found to be much higher over the silica-supported platinum, although the rates were not far different at the temperatures of this study."
[6] "The difference in activation energies for the different supports suggests that the support interacts with platinum in some manner, and that silica differs from alumina with regard to such an interaction."

The hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts, one employing silica as a support and the other alumina, was investigated in this study. The rate of hydrogenolysis to methane was found to increase with ethane partial pressure to a power in the range 0.7 to 0.9. However, the rate decreased markedly with increasing hydrogen pressure. The apparent activation energy of the reaction was found to be much higher over the silica-supported platinum, although the rates were not far different at the temperatures of this study. The difference in activation energies for the different supports suggests that the support interacts with platinum in some manner, and that silica differs from alumina with regard to such an interaction. The results can be explained by the mechanism proposed by Cimino, Boudart, and Taylor, which involves the reaction steps of ethane hydrogenolysis over metals involving the formation of an adsorbed dehydrogenated radical, its reaction with hydrogen to form surface fragments, and their hydrogenation to form methane. The most interesting finding of the present study is the marked difference in the apparent activation energy for the two platinum catalysts studied, suggesting some specific interaction between platinum and support is involved.

本研究对支持铂的乙烷氢解进行了调查，一种使用硅作为支持体，另一种使用氧化铝。发现随着乙烷分压增加，氢解反应速率在0.7到0.9的范围内增加。然而，氢分压增加显著降低了速率。反应的表观活化能对于硅支持的铂催化剂要高得多，但温度下速率差异不大。不同支撑物之间的差异表明，铂与支撑物之间存在某种相互作用，且硅与氧化铝在这方面存在差异。结果可由Cimino、Boudart和Taylor提出的机制解释，该机制涉及金属上乙烷氢解的反应步骤，包括形成吸附脱氢自由基、与氢反应形成表面碎片以及它们的氢化形成甲烷。目前研究最有趣的结果是两种铂催化剂的表观活化能有显著差异，这表明铂与支持物之间可能存在特定的相互作用。
