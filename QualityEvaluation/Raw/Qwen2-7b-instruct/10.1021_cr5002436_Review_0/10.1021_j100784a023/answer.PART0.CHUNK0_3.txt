[1] "The reaction rate measurements were carried out in a flow system at atmospheric pressure."
[2] "The rate data showing the effects of hydrogen and ethane partial pressures, PH and PE) respectively, are summarized in Table I in the form of a ratio r/ro, where r is the rate at any given conditions and ro is the rate at a standard set of conditions (pH = 0.20 atm., pE := 0.030 atm.)."
[3] "The species C2H,represents an adsorbed dehydrogenated radical which reacts with a molecule of hydrogen to form the surface fragments CH, and CH,. The latter are hydrogenated off the surface to form methane."
[4] "While the degree of dispersion of the platinum may be different on alumina and silica, the difference in apparent activation energies cannot be rationalized readily on the basis of a difference in platinum surface areas alone,since this would be expected to affect only the magnitudes of the rates rather than the temperature dependence."
[5] "It seems more likely that some specific interaction between platinum and support is involved. The widely held impression5 that supports do not interact with noble metals is thus open to considerable question."

The literature discusses the hydrogenolysis of ethane over supported platinum catalysts. It explains that the reaction rate increases with ethane partial pressure to a power in the range 0.7 to 0.9, but decreases markedly with increasing hydrogen pressure. The apparent activation energy of the reaction is much higher over the silica-supported platinum, suggesting that the support interacts with the platinum in some manner. The study also finds differences in activation energies between the silica and alumina supports, which cannot be explained solely by the difference in platinum surface areas, indicating a specific interaction between platinum and support. The widely held belief that supports do not interact with noble metals is challenged by these findings.

文献讨论了铂基负载催化剂上乙烷的氢解反应。它解释说，随着乙烷分压的增加，反应速率以介于0.7到0.9之间的指数增加，但随着氢气分压的增加，反应速率显著降低。在硅基负载的铂催化剂上的反应活化能明显更高，这表明支持物与铂之间存在某种相互作用。研究还发现，硅和氧化铝支持的铂催化剂的活化能不同，这一差异不能仅归因于铂表面面积的不同，这暗示了铂与支持物之间存在特定的相互作用。普遍认为支持物不会与贵金属相互作用的观点受到了挑战。
