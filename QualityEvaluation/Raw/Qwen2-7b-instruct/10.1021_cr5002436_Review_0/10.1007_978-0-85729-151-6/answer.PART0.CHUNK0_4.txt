Chapter 9 deals with alkanes dehydrogenation. Olefins production by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes might be an alternative to conventional heavy hydrocarbons cracking. Also in this case the catalytic membrane reactor might improve the process yield. In particular is studied the coupling of the PdAg membrane and catalysts usually used in the dehydrogenation process that need to operate at low H2 partial pressures.

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Their market trends often reflect broader economic conditions and consumer preferences. The key production methods for olefins typically involve dehydrogenation of alkanes, which can be carried out through conventional processes or innovative methods like catalytic membrane reactors. The thermodynamic challenges associated with these syntheses include managing the effects of temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Shorter chain alkanes require higher temperatures and pressures to drive the dehydrogenation reaction efficiently. The use of catalytic membrane reactors can enhance yield by selectively removing hydrogen, which is a byproduct of the dehydrogenation process, thus allowing the reaction to proceed further. These reactors are particularly suited for operating at low hydrogen partial pressures, which can improve the efficiency and economics of the process.

轻烯烃如丙烯和乙烯对化工行业至关重要，因其广泛的应用范围，包括塑料、溶剂和燃料。它们的市场趋势往往反映了更广泛的经济条件和消费者偏好。轻烯烃的主要生产方法通常涉及烷烃的脱氢，这可以通过传统工艺或创新方法如催化膜反应器进行。与这些合成相关的热力学挑战包括管理温度、压力和烷烃链长的影响。较短碳链的烷烃需要更高的温度和压力来有效地驱动脱氢反应。使用催化膜反应器可以提高产量，通过选择性地去除副产品氢气，从而允许反应进一步进行。这些反应器特别适合在较低氢气分压下运行，这可以提高过程的效率和经济性。
