<p>For biotechnological applications, synthetic membranes entrapping enzymes, bacteria, or animal cells are used in membrane bioreactors disclosing new important developments mainly due to the increased stability of immobilized enzymes, the possibility of their continuous reuse and the absence of pollution of the products.</p>
<p>In the field of inorganic heterogeneous catalysis, metallic or ceramic membranes are used to bear the generally more severe thermal conditions. Both dense and porous, inert and catalytically active membranes have been used in the different processes analyzed in the scientific or technical literature.</p>
<p>Pd-based membranes, mainly PdAg (23%wt), have been extensively tested for natural gas steam reforming, which is the main process to produce large amount of hydrogen. Many experimental works are reported in the literature attesting the good performance in terms of natural gas conversion at much lower operating temperature than traditional process (methane conversions up to 9095% at 450550 vs. 8501000C).</p>
<p>The use of inorganic MRs has been investigated for a number of reactions. Pd-based membranes, mainly PdAg (23%wt), have been extensively tested for natural gas steam reforming, which is the main process to produce large amount of hydrogen.</p>
<p>A growing interest in the membrane assisted WaterGas Shift reaction (WGSR) is manifested by a substantial volume of the published pertinent literature that could be grouped around the two most popular hydrogen permselective membranes, based either on palladium or silica.</p>
<p>Some kinds of reactions (irreversible reactions) require very high conversions to reach equilibrium conditions at a given temperature, whereas for other reactions a quite low value of the conversion corresponds to equilibrium. These latter reactions are named reversible reactions according to the thermodynamic statement that each transformation close to equilibrium is a reversible transformation.</p>
<p>A very simple reversible reaction in gaseous phase can be used to show the effect of separation units on the attainable conversion:</p>
<p>A , B</p>
<p>rA
k1  PA  k2  PB</p>
<p>By adopting the scheme of Fig. 1.3 and using a membrane unit (Membrane 1) to remove a fraction c of the product B generated in the first reactor of finite volume V1, the reaction can proceed in the second reactor and a conversion even higher than the equilibrium value can be reached in a finite reaction volume given by the sum of the two reactor volumes, V1 and V2.</p>
<p>The conversion XA is defined as the reacted fraction of A in the feed leaving the system with the effluent. The removal percentage q is the ratio between the flow rate of B in permeate and the flow rate of this product entering the membrane module.</p>
<p>Fixing the flow rate of B in the permeate is a realistic basis since in many cases the aim in using a membrane system with recycle is just to obtain a specific flow rate of the product with a high conversion of the reactant.</p>
<p>When Sieverts-Fick law is valid, the flux of B is given by:</p>
<p>JB  PeBT d</p>
<p>p0:5 B;ret  p0:5 B;perm</p>
<p>where d is the thickness of the dense membrane, pB,ret and pB,perm are the partial pressures of B in the retentate and permeate regions, respectively and:</p>
<p>PeBT  Pe0 B  exp  Ea</p>
<p>R  T</p>
<p>is the permeability which depends on the temperature T according to the Arrhenius behavior.</p>
<p>Compared with Pd-based membranes, which are much more selective with respect to hydrogen, porous membranes are less efficient in improving the conversion.</p>

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in the production of polymers, plastics, and various chemical intermediates. Their demand is driven by trends such as global population growth, urbanization, and rising standards of living, leading to increased consumption of goods requiring these materials. Key production methods for olefins involve the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, typically in the presence of catalysts, and sometimes with the aid of membrane reactors to enhance selectivity and efficiency.

Thermodynamic challenges related to olefin synthesis primarily revolve around optimizing the balance between reaction temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length to achieve desired yields. High temperatures and pressures facilitate cracking reactions, but they also increase the risk of side reactions and require robust catalysts. Longer alkane chains require higher temperatures and pressures to achieve effective cracking, posing limitations on the energy input and the selectivity towards olefins. The use of membrane reactors, as highlighted in the document, can mitigate these challenges by selectively separating products, allowing reactions to proceed closer to equilibrium with higher conversion rates at lower temperatures and pressures.

Market trends for olefins exhibit growth, particularly in emerging economies.

Key production methods for light olefins encompass steam cracking of naphtha, ethane cracker units, and gas-to-liquids (GTL) processes. These methodologies typically employ elevated temperatures and pressures to transform larger hydrocarbons into smaller olefin molecules.

Thermodynamic challenges associated with olefin synthesis primarily center around achieving high conversion rates within acceptable temperature and pressure conditions. For instance, steam cracking operations occur at temperatures exceeding 800°C and pressures around 1 atmosphere. This high-temperature requirement poses challenges in terms of catalyst deactivation and material degradation over time.

Temperature and pressure levels are critical in influencing olefin conversion rates during the cracking process. Increased temperatures accelerate reaction rates but also heighten risks of product thermal decomposition. Higher pressures, while enhancing conversion, necessitate sturdier equipment designs and elevate energy consumption.

Selective catalysts are employed to prioritize the formation of specific olefins, such as propylene or ethylene, while minimizing byproduct production. This balance is essential for optimizing olefin yields.

Alkane chain length effects impact cracking efficiency. Longer chains require higher temperatures and pressures for effective breakdown, while shorter chains may lead to incomplete cracking, resulting in lower olefin yields. Optimal chain lengths vary depending on the intended application and specific cracking process utilized.

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Their market trends often reflect broader economic conditions and consumer preferences. The key production methods for olefins typically involve dehydrogenation of alkanes, which can be carried out through conventional processes or innovative methods like catalytic membrane reactors. The thermodynamic challenges associated with these syntheses include managing the effects of temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Shorter chain alkanes require higher temperatures and pressures to drive the dehydrogenation reaction efficiently. The use of catalytic membrane reactors can enhance yield by selectively removing hydrogen, which is a byproduct of the dehydrogenation process, thus allowing the reaction to proceed further. These reactors are particularly suited for operating at low hydrogen partial pressures, which can improve the efficiency and economics of the process.
