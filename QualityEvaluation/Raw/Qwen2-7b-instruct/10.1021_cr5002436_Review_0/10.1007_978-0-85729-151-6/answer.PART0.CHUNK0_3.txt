[1] "In the field of inorganic heterogeneous catalysis, metallic or ceramic membranes are used to bear the generally more severe thermal conditions."
[2] "Many experimental works are reported in the literature [7-11], attesting the good performance in terms of natural gas conversion at much lower operating temperature than traditional process (methane conversions up to 90-95% at 450-550°C vs. 850-1000°C)."
[3] "For example, the conversion of cyclohexane to benzene at 200°C and 1 atm (equilibrium conversion 19%) is 45% in a Vycor glass MR whereas it becomes 99.7% in a PdAg MR."
[4] "In the case of reversible reactions, removing one or more products as they are generated allows conversions higher than equilibrium values to be reached."
[5] "In order to achieve a conversion XA = 0.572 if no product removal is carried out, while conversions XA = 0.625 and XA = 0.674 are obtained with removal fractions c = 0.3 and c = 0.5, respectively."
[6] "A removal ratio c = 0.5 used in the first membrane unit (Fig. 1.3) located at the outlet of a reactor with a volume V1 = 0.8 allows the conversion profile in the second reactor to be higher than in the case of absence of membrane unit."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry due to their wide range of applications including plastics, fuels, solvents, and lubricants. Their market trends are closely tied to global demand for various products they enable. Key production methods involve the cracking of larger hydrocarbons, notably through thermal cracking of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Thermodynamic challenges are associated with these processes, particularly regarding temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. Higher temperatures and pressures are typically used to increase reaction rates and yield, but this can lead to energy-intensive operations. Shorter alkane chains are favored because they yield more olefins upon cracking. Membrane reactors can help optimize these processes by allowing reactions to occur at lower temperatures, reducing energy demands and enabling more efficient separations. They can improve yields and reduce the need for additional heat inputs, making the synthesis of light olefins more sustainable and economically viable.
