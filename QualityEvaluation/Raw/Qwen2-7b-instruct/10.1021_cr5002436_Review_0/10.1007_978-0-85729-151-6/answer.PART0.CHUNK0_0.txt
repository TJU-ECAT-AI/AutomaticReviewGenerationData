<p>For biotechnological applications, synthetic membranes entrapping enzymes, bacteria, or animal cells are used in membrane bioreactors disclosing new important developments mainly due to the increased stability of immobilized enzymes, the possibility of their continuous reuse and the absence of pollution of the products.</p>
<p>In the field of inorganic heterogeneous catalysis, metallic or ceramic membranes are used to bear the generally more severe thermal conditions. Both dense and porous, inert and catalytically active membranes have been used in the different processes analyzed in the scientific or technical literature.</p>
<p>Pd-based membranes, mainly PdAg (23%wt), have been extensively tested for natural gas steam reforming, which is the main process to produce large amount of hydrogen. Many experimental works are reported in the literature attesting the good performance in terms of natural gas conversion at much lower operating temperature than traditional process (methane conversions up to 9095% at 450550 vs. 8501000C).</p>
<p>The use of inorganic MRs has been investigated for a number of reactions. Pd-based membranes, mainly PdAg (23%wt), have been extensively tested for natural gas steam reforming, which is the main process to produce large amount of hydrogen.</p>
<p>A growing interest in the membrane assisted WaterGas Shift reaction (WGSR) is manifested by a substantial volume of the published pertinent literature that could be grouped around the two most popular hydrogen permselective membranes, based either on palladium or silica.</p>
<p>Some kinds of reactions (irreversible reactions) require very high conversions to reach equilibrium conditions at a given temperature, whereas for other reactions a quite low value of the conversion corresponds to equilibrium. These latter reactions are named reversible reactions according to the thermodynamic statement that each transformation close to equilibrium is a reversible transformation.</p>
<p>A very simple reversible reaction in gaseous phase can be used to show the effect of separation units on the attainable conversion:</p>
<p>A , B</p>
<p>rA
k1  PA  k2  PB</p>
<p>By adopting the scheme of Fig. 1.3 and using a membrane unit (Membrane 1) to remove a fraction c of the product B generated in the first reactor of finite volume V1, the reaction can proceed in the second reactor and a conversion even higher than the equilibrium value can be reached in a finite reaction volume given by the sum of the two reactor volumes, V1 and V2.</p>
<p>The conversion XA is defined as the reacted fraction of A in the feed leaving the system with the effluent. The removal percentage q is the ratio between the flow rate of B in permeate and the flow rate of this product entering the membrane module.</p>
<p>Fixing the flow rate of B in the permeate is a realistic basis since in many cases the aim in using a membrane system with recycle is just to obtain a specific flow rate of the product with a high conversion of the reactant.</p>
<p>When Sieverts-Fick law is valid, the flux of B is given by:</p>
<p>JB  PeBT d</p>
<p>p0:5 B;ret  p0:5 B;perm</p>
<p>where d is the thickness of the dense membrane, pB,ret and pB,perm are the partial pressures of B in the retentate and permeate regions, respectively and:</p>
<p>PeBT  Pe0 B  exp  Ea</p>
<p>R  T</p>
<p>is the permeability which depends on the temperature T according to the Arrhenius behavior.</p>
<p>Compared with Pd-based membranes, which are much more selective with respect to hydrogen, porous membranes are less efficient in improving the conversion.</p>

Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in the production of polymers, plastics, and various chemical intermediates. Their demand is driven by trends such as global population growth, urbanization, and rising standards of living, leading to increased consumption of goods requiring these materials. Key production methods for olefins involve the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, typically in the presence of catalysts, and sometimes with the aid of membrane reactors to enhance selectivity and efficiency.

Thermodynamic challenges related to olefin synthesis primarily revolve around optimizing the balance between reaction temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length to achieve desired yields. High temperatures and pressures facilitate cracking reactions, but they also increase the risk of side reactions and require robust catalysts. Longer alkane chains require higher temperatures and pressures to achieve effective cracking, posing limitations on the energy input and the selectivity towards olefins. The use of membrane reactors, as highlighted in the document, can mitigate these challenges by selectively separating products, allowing reactions to proceed closer to equilibrium with higher conversion rates at lower temperatures and pressures.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中至关重要，因为它们在聚合物、塑料和其他化学品中间体的生产中的广泛应用。它们的需求受到全球人口增长、城市化和生活水平提高等趋势的推动，导致对这些材料的需求增加。关键的生产方法涉及热裂解烃类，通常在催化剂的存在下，并且有时借助膜反应器来增强选择性和效率。

烯烃合成的热力学挑战主要集中在优化温度、压力和烷烃链长之间的平衡，以实现所需的产率。高温和高压有利于裂解反应，但也增加了副反应的风险，并需要坚固的催化剂。更长的烷烃链要求更高的温度和压力进行有效的裂解，这在能源输入和选择性向烯烃方向方面带来了限制。文中提到的膜反应器可以缓解这些挑战，通过选择性地分离产品，使反应在较低温度和压力下更接近平衡，具有更高的转化率。
