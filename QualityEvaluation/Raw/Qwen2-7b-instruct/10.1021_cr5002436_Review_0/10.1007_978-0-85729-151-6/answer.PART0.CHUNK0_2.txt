<p>Membrane reactors are systems coupling reaction and separation of one or more products, with the separation operation performed by a selective membrane.</p>
<p>A membrane reactor (MR) is a system that integrates reaction and separation in a single unit, offering benefits such as increased efficiency and economic advantages.</p>
<p>The use of inorganic MRs has been investigated for a number of reactions, including natural gas steam reforming, dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the WaterGas Shift reaction.</p>
<p>In the case of reversible reactions, removing one or more products as they are generated allows conversions higher than equilibrium values to be reached.</p>
<p>Membrane reactors have been used for natural gas steam reforming, showing methane conversions up to 90-95% at lower operating temperatures than traditional processes.</p>
<p>For the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, a conversion increase beyond the equilibrium value has been observed in membrane reactors compared to traditional methods.</p>
<p>The integration of selective membrane in chemical processes allows for the attainment of higher conversions than equilibrium values.</p>

Membrane reactors offer integration of reaction and separation in a single unit, enhancing efficiency and economic benefits. They have been applied in various chemical processes, including natural gas steam reforming and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane. By removing products as they are generated, conversions exceeding equilibrium values can be achieved. In natural gas steam reforming, high methane conversions (up to 90-95%) are obtained at lower temperatures than traditional methods. For dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, higher conversions than equilibrium values are observed in membrane reactors compared to conventional techniques. The selective membrane integration enables higher conversions in reversible reactions.

膜反应器在单个单元中结合了反应和分离，提高了效率和经济效益。它们被应用于各种化学过程，包括天然气蒸汽重整和环己烷脱氢。通过去除生成的产品，可以实现超过平衡值的转化率。在天然气蒸汽重整中，使用较低温度可以获得高达90-95%的甲烷转化率，比传统方法低。对于环己烷脱氢，与传统方法相比，在膜反应器中观察到高于平衡值的转化率。选择性膜集成使可逆反应中的转化率更高。
