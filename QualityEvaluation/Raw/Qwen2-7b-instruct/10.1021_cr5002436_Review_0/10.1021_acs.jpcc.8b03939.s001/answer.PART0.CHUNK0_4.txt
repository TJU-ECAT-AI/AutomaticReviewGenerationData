1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in various sectors including plastics, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Their primary production methods are steam cracking and thermal cracking, which face thermodynamic challenges related to temperature and pressure. Temperature impacts the reaction rate and product selectivity, while pressure affects the molecular structure of the resulting olefins. Alkane chain length also influences the efficiency of these cracking processes.
