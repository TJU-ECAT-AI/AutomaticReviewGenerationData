1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, significantly contribute to the chemical industry due to their extensive use in producing polymers, solvents, and other chemical products. They are primarily synthesized through steam cracking and thermal cracking processes. Thermodynamic challenges in these processes involve maintaining optimal temperatures and pressures to achieve desired product yields. Additionally, the length of the alkane chain influences the selectivity of the reactions.
