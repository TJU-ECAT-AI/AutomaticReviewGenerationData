[1] "As an example, in this paper we will discuss the results obtained for a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[2] "It is clear that no major peak intensity changes can be observed."
[3] "This is in good agreement with the activity data, which shows an identical performance of the catalyst in subsequent cycles."
[4] "The fact that it is now possible to use fast and easily applicable operando spectroscopic techniques using fiber optics allows the use of it in the chemical industry as a means of advanced process control in the near future."
[5] "Since the Raman measurements provide us with direct information on the amount of coke on the catalyst, this technique is most suitable for that."
[6] "Permanent deactivation of the catalyst is linked to a decrease in the amount of this redox type chromium oxide."
[7] "Also, the Cr3+ band at 630 nm has shifted a bit to the right, which is indicative of chromium moving into the alumina support."

The dehydrogenation of propane is an industrially very important reaction with a relatively short catalyst lifetime. Close to 10 million metric tons of olefins are produced using catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The catalyst deactivates fast, commonly requiring a regenerative procedure in air once every 20-30 min. After this regeneration, the catalyst can be reused for the dehydrogenation. The study provides operando spectroscopic information on the short- and long-term deactivation process of the catalyst. The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine long-term deactivation was verified by performing a propane dehydrogenation experiment in which the catalyst was purposefully deactivated. After 100 hours of dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the UV-VIS spectrum of the catalyst in the oxidized state did not change significantly. However, after a deliberate deactivation procedure, the absorbance of the active chromia species at 450 nm was significantly less, indicating catalyst deactivation by loss of active chromium sites. The Cr3+ band at 630 nm shifted slightly to the right, indicating that chromium moved into the alumina support.

丙烷脱氢反应是工业上非常重要且催化剂寿命较短的反应，每年近1000万吨烯烃通过催化脱氢过程生产。催化剂快速失活，通常需要每20-30分钟在空气中进行再生操作。再生后，催化剂可以重新用于脱氢。研究提供了关于催化剂短时间和长期失活过程的原位光谱信息。通过在催化剂上进行故意失活实验验证了原位紫外可见测量确定长期失活的能力。在连续100小时的脱氢-再生周期后，催化剂氧化状态下的紫外可见光谱没有显著变化。然而，在故意失活程序之后，450纳米波长下活性铬氧化物的吸收度显著减少，表明催化剂由于活性铬位点的损失而失活。630纳米波长下的Cr3+峰向右稍微移动，表明铬迁移到了氧化铝支持体中。
