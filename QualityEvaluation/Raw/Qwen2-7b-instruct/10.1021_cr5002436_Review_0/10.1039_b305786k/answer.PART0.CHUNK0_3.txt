[1] "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the advantage of the multi-technique approach in catalytic testing and analysis. It will be shown that the information collected has good potential to be used as a tool to more efficiently operate a propane dehydrogenation process."
[2] "As an example, in this paper we will discuss the results obtained for a 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst. This catalyst is similar to the one used in industrial processes."
[3] "In industry, this loss of propane is often circumvented by a short catalyst-reduction using hydrogen immediately before switching to propane."
[4] "This rapid change in the observed catalyst state is in agreement with the fact that the mass spectrometer detects a short carbon dioxide production immediately after the start of the oxidation cycle."
[5] "The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine long-term deactivation was verified by performing a propane dehydrogenation experiment in which the catalyst was purposefully deactivated."

The document discusses a novel experimental setup that combines various time-resolved spectroscopic techniques for the characterization of supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions. These techniques include UV-VIS, Raman, and on-line mass spectrometry. The setup is used to study the propane dehydrogenation over chromium oxide on alumina catalyst, a process critical for the chemical industry. The document highlights the potential of using these multi-technique approaches for more efficient operation of the propane dehydrogenation process. It also mentions that in industrial processes, propane loss during catalyst deactivation is often addressed through a short catalyst reduction using hydrogen before switching back to propane. The rapid change in catalyst state during the oxidation cycle is noted to align with the detection of carbon dioxide production by the mass spectrometer. The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine catalyst long-term deactivation is confirmed through an experiment where the catalyst was deliberately deactivated.

本文讨论了一种新型实验设置，用于在工作条件下对支持金属氧化物催化剂进行各种时间分辨光谱学表征。这些技术包括紫外可见光谱、拉曼光谱和在线质谱分析。该设置被用于研究铬氧化铝上烷烃脱氢过程中的丙烷脱氢。这一过程对于化学工业至关重要。文档强调了使用这些多技术方法为更高效操作丙烷脱氢过程的可能性。它还提到，在工业过程中，通过在切换回丙烷之前使用氢气对催化剂进行短时还原来解决催化剂失活期间的丙烷损失问题。氧化周期中催化剂状态的快速变化与质谱检测到的二氧化碳产生相吻合。通过一个实验验证了原位紫外可见光谱测量确定催化剂长期失活的能力，该实验故意使催化剂失活。
