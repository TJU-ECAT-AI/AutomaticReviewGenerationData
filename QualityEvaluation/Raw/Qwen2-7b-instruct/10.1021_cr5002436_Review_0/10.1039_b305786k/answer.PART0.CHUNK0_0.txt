The light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in various industries including petrochemicals, plastics manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. They are essential raw materials for producing polymers, solvents, and numerous chemical compounds. The market trends for olefins are driven by demand for downstream products, with global production capacity growing steadily. Key production methods involve catalytic cracking, steam cracking, and thermal cracking. Thermodynamic challenges include optimizing reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length, to maximize olefin yield while minimizing energy consumption and product selectivity. For instance, higher temperatures and pressures typically enhance olefin production but can lead to increased side reactions and energy costs. Similarly, the length of the alkane chain affects the reaction kinetics and the distribution of products. The document highlights the importance of operando spectroscopic techniques in monitoring the deactivation process of catalysts used in olefin production, providing insights into catalyst performance and guiding process optimization. This information is critical for maintaining high yields and efficiency in industrial-scale operations.
