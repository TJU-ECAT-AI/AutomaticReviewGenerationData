[1] "In industry, this loss of propane is often circumvented by a short catalystreduction using hydrogen immediately before switching to propane."
[2] "In industrial processes the alkane dehydrogenation is often carried out with some excess catalyst to obtain the equilibrium conversion of the reaction."

1. In the chemical industry, light olefins such as propylene and ethylene are crucial due to their extensive applications in various sectors including plastics, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. These products have a significant market trend driven by their utility in manufacturing numerous consumer goods and industrial materials. The key production methods involve thermal cracking of naphtha, natural gas, and heavy oil, where alkane chains are broken down to form lighter olefinic compounds. Thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis primarily revolve around optimizing temperature and pressure conditions to achieve efficient cracking reactions. The temperature typically ranges from 700°C to 1000°C, while pressures can vary widely depending on the specific process. Additionally, maintaining a balance between the chain length of the alkane and the desired olefin yield is crucial, as longer chain alkanes require higher temperatures and pressures for effective conversion. Excess catalyst usage is employed to ensure that the equilibrium conversion of the reaction is reached, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
