The light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry due to their extensive applications in various industries including petrochemicals, plastics manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. They are essential raw materials for producing polymers, solvents, and numerous chemical compounds. The market trends for olefins are driven by demand for downstream products, with global production capacity growing steadily. Key production methods involve catalytic cracking, steam cracking, and thermal cracking. Thermodynamic challenges include optimizing reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length, to maximize olefin yield while minimizing energy consumption and product selectivity. For instance, higher temperatures and pressures typically enhance olefin production but can lead to increased side reactions and energy costs. Similarly, the length of the alkane chain affects the reaction kinetics and the distribution of products. The document highlights the importance of operando spectroscopic techniques in monitoring the deactivation process of catalysts used in olefin production, providing insights into catalyst performance and guiding process optimization. This information is critical for maintaining high yields and efficiency in industrial-scale operations.

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They serve as building blocks for the production of various polymers, solvents, and other chemical products. Their demand is driven by the growth of industries like plastics manufacturing, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Key production methods involve cracking heavy hydrocarbons at high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges include achieving efficient conversion rates while managing the risk of catalyst deactivation, which can occur due to the formation of coke or other degradation products.

2. In the context of the study described, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene serves as a model process for understanding catalyst behavior and deactivation mechanisms. The catalyst, a 13 wt% chromium oxide on alumina, experiences fast deactivation during the reaction, leading to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface. Operando spectroscopic techniques, including UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy, allow for real-time monitoring of the catalyst's performance, including the formation and coverage of coke. These methods can be used to adjust the process parameters, such as the cycle time for dehydrogenation and regeneration phases, to optimize the efficiency and longevity of the catalyst. Additionally, UV-VIS spectroscopy can provide insights into long-term catalyst deactivation, enabling timely replacement to prevent significant loss in production capacity.

1. In the chemical industry, light olefins such as propylene and ethylene are crucial due to their extensive applications in various sectors including plastics, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. These products have a significant market trend driven by their utility in manufacturing numerous consumer goods and industrial materials. The key production methods involve thermal cracking of naphtha, natural gas, and heavy oil, where alkane chains are broken down to form lighter olefinic compounds. Thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis primarily revolve around optimizing temperature and pressure conditions to achieve efficient cracking reactions. The temperature typically ranges from 700°C to 1000°C, while pressures can vary widely depending on the specific process. Additionally, maintaining a balance between the chain length of the alkane and the desired olefin yield is crucial, as longer chain alkanes require higher temperatures and pressures for effective conversion. Excess catalyst usage is employed to ensure that the equilibrium conversion of the reaction is reached, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

The dehydrogenation of propane is an industrially very important reaction with a relatively short catalyst lifetime. Close to 10 million metric tons of olefins are produced using catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The catalyst deactivates fast, commonly requiring a regenerative procedure in air once every 20-30 min. After this regeneration, the catalyst can be reused for the dehydrogenation. The study provides operando spectroscopic information on the short- and long-term deactivation process of the catalyst. The capability of operando UV-VIS measurements to determine long-term deactivation was verified by performing a propane dehydrogenation experiment in which the catalyst was purposefully deactivated. After 100 hours of dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the UV-VIS spectrum of the catalyst in the oxidized state did not change significantly. However, after a deliberate deactivation procedure, the absorbance of the active chromia species at 450 nm was significantly less, indicating catalyst deactivation by loss of active chromium sites. The Cr3+ band at 630 nm shifted slightly to the right, indicating that chromium moved into the alumina support.

丙烷脱氢反应是工业上非常重要且催化剂寿命较短的反应，每年近1000万吨烯烃通过催化脱氢过程生产。催化剂快速失活，通常需要每20-30分钟在空气中进行再生操作。再生后，催化剂可以重新用于脱氢。研究提供了关于催化剂短时间和长期失活过程的原位光谱信息。通过在催化剂上进行故意失活实验验证了原位紫外可见测量确定长期失活的能力。在连续100小时的脱氢-再生周期后，催化剂氧化状态下的紫外可见光谱没有显著变化。然而，在故意失活程序之后，450纳米波长下活性铬氧化物的吸收度显著减少，表明催化剂由于活性铬位点的损失而失活。630纳米波长下的Cr3+峰向右稍微移动，表明铬迁移到了氧化铝支持体中。
