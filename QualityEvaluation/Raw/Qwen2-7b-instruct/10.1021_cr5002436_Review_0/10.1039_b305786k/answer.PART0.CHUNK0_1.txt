[1] "In the propane dehydrogenation the catalyst deactivates fast. Commonly, a regenerative procedure in air is, therefore, used for the catalyst once every 2030 min."
[2] "After this regeneration, the catalyst can be re-used for the dehydrogenation."
[3] "The fact that it is now possible to use fast and easily applicable operando spectroscopic techniques using fiber optics allows the use of it in the chemical industry as a means of advanced process control in the near future."
[4] "Being able to monitor directly the amount of coke on the dehydrogenation catalyst allows for the use of process control system, which dynamically adjusts the cycle time for the dehydrogenation-regeneration phases to optimally run the process."
[5] "Operando UV-VIS measurements can be used to monitor the long-term deactivation of the catalyst."
[6] "Therefore, the change in the relative peak intensities of the 450 and 630 nm bands (Fig. 3) on switching from air to propane can be used to determine when the catalyst needs to be replaced."
[7] "In Fig. 4, it can be seen that the UV-VIS spectrum of the catalyst in the oxidated state does not change significantly from the initial state compared to that after 100 hours of dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[8] "Also, the Cr3+ band at 630 nm has shifted a bit to the right, which is indicative of chromium moving into the alumina support."

1. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry. They serve as building blocks for the production of various polymers, solvents, and other chemical products. Their demand is driven by the growth of industries like plastics manufacturing, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Key production methods involve cracking heavy hydrocarbons at high temperatures and pressures. Thermodynamic challenges include achieving efficient conversion rates while managing the risk of catalyst deactivation, which can occur due to the formation of coke or other degradation products.

2. In the context of the study described, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene serves as a model process for understanding catalyst behavior and deactivation mechanisms. The catalyst, a 13 wt% chromium oxide on alumina, experiences fast deactivation during the reaction, leading to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface. Operando spectroscopic techniques, including UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy, allow for real-time monitoring of the catalyst's performance, including the formation and coverage of coke. These methods can be used to adjust the process parameters, such as the cycle time for dehydrogenation and regeneration phases, to optimize the efficiency and longevity of the catalyst. Additionally, UV-VIS spectroscopy can provide insights into long-term catalyst deactivation, enabling timely replacement to prevent significant loss in production capacity.
