2.2.2. VOx In consideration of the low-price and high-reactivity, the supported VOx catalysts are believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in the selective DH reactions of light alkanes into olefins.
2.3.1. Co and CoOx For the Co-catalyzed activation and functionalization of CH bonds in the hydrocarbons, such as direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and cycloalkanes, their development has achieved notable success.
2.3.2. Fe and FeOx Al2O3-supported Fe and Fe2+ species obtained from the pre-reduction of the 10FeAl catalyst by CO or H2 are catalytically active and selective for PDH reactions, because of the elimination of the surface electronegative oxygen species that are responsible for suppressing the propylene cracking and the formation of coke species.
2.4. ZnOx-Based catalysts Either nanosized ZnO assemblies or single-site Zn2+ ions have been reported to be catalytically active in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
2.5. ZrOx-Based catalysts ZrO2-based catalysts show catalytic activities for the CH activation and selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface, β-H extraction from the adsorbed propane molecule, and the subsequent desorption of propylene. The debate over which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. While the exact mechanism remains uncertain, this ambiguity underscores the complexity of the PDH reaction, necessitating further exploration of the structure-property relationship and the development of efficient catalysts. The uncertainty also highlights the importance of considering the interplay between adsorption energies, activation barriers, and the catalytic properties of the active sites.

逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：丙烷在催化剂表面的离解吸附，从吸附的丙烷分子中提取β-H，随后是丙烯的释放。关于这一步骤——离解吸附还是β-H提取是决定性步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。虽然确切的机制仍然不确定，但这种不确定性强调了PDH反应的复杂性，需要进一步探索结构-性质关系，并开发高效的催化剂。这种不确定性也突出了考虑吸附能、激活壁垒和活性位点催化性质之间相互作用的重要性。
