2.2.2. VOx In consideration of the low-price and high-reactivity, the supported VOx catalysts are believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in the selective DH reactions of light alkanes into olefins. In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration.133 

2.3. Co and CoOx For the Co-catalyzed activation and functionalization of CH bonds in the hydrocarbons, such as direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and cycloalkanes, their development has achieved notable success.169 The metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes.170176

2.3.1. Fe and FeOx Al2O3-supported Fe and Fe2+ species obtained from the pre-reduction of the 10FeAl catalyst by CO or H2 are catalytically active and selective for PDH reactions, because of the elimination of the surface electronegative oxygen species that are responsible for suppressing the propylene cracking and the formation of coke species.193

2.3.2. Sn and SnOx The promotion effects of Sn species in Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts through the geometric and electronic modifications have been widely studied since 1960s, as discussed in the previous sections. However, Sn alone can play the role of the active sites in the dehydrogenation reactions instead of the promoters (Table 5).203207

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption of propane, β-H extraction, and desorption of olefin. The literature discusses ongoing debates regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty about the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the most effective catalysts and operating conditions. It is unclear whether the slowest step is the adsorption of propane, the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H extraction), or the desorption of the resulting olefin product. This lack of clarity hinders the optimization of the PDH process and the development of more efficient catalysts.

To address this uncertainty, researchers need to conduct more detailed kinetic studies to determine the rate-controlling step. This might involve measuring the reaction rates under various conditions, such as different temperatures, pressures, or concentrations of reactants. Additionally, computational modeling could be employed to simulate the PDH mechanism and estimate the activation energies for each step. Understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for developing more effective catalysts and optimizing the PDH process for practical applications.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate around which step is the rate-controlling process impacts our understanding of PDH. The literature does not explicitly resolve this debate, leaving it open for further investigation.

The dissociative adsorption of propane onto a catalyst surface is followed by the extraction of a β-H atom, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical and a hydrogen molecule. This step is influenced by the catalyst's surface properties, such as its d-band center, and can lead to the formation of either a 1- or 2-propyl intermediate, depending on the catalyst's nature. The adsorption of the resulting olefin intermediate on the catalyst's surface can occur through π- or di-σ binding, depending on the catalyst's surface characteristics, temperature, pressure, and the composition of co-fed gases.

The CH activation and olefin desorption processes are essential for achieving high olefin selectivity and long-term stability in PDH reactions. Metals and metal oxides exhibit different specific reaction rates for PDH. Monometallic platinum (Pt) and bimetallic systems like PtSn often show significantly higher rates (101 s<sup>-1</sup>) compared to metal oxide-based catalysts (10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The strength of olefin adsorption onto the Pt surface is determined by the geometric and electronic properties of the Pt atoms.

Strong acid sites on the catalyst surface can tightly bind with olefin intermediates, facilitating their transformation into coke precursors through processes like deep dehydrogenation or oligomerization. This significantly affects the selectivity and stability of the dehydrogenation process. The literature proposes a monolayer-multilayer coke growth model to describe the activity-coke content relationship over catalysts like Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。文献没有明确解决这一争论，留待进一步研究。

PDH过程包括丙烷在催化剂表面的解离吸附，随后从分子中提取一个β-H原子，形成一个烷基自由基和一个氢分子。该步骤受到催化剂表面性质的影响，如其d带中心，可能导致形成1-或2-丙基中间体，具体取决于催化剂的性质。形成的烯烃中间体在催化剂表面的吸附可以是π型或di-σ型，具体取决于催化剂的表面特性、温度、压力以及共喂气体的组成。

CH活化和烯烃脱附过程对于实现高烯烃选择性和长期稳定性至关重要。金属和金属氧化物表现出不同的PDH特定反应速率。单金属铂（Pt）和二元系统如PtSn通常显示比金属氧化物基催化剂（10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>）更高的速率（101 s<sup>-1</sup>）。烯烃在Pt表面的吸附强度由Pt原子的几何和电子性质决定。

催化剂表面的强酸性位点可以紧密地与烯烃中间体结合，促进它们转化为焦炭前体，通过深脱氢或聚合等过程。这显著影响了脱氢过程的选择性和稳定性。文献提出了一个单层-多层焦炭生长模型来描述Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>催化剂的活性-焦炭含量关系。

Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface with the breaking of one or more hydrogen bonds. The β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, followed by the desorption of the resulting olefin. The exact sequence and relative energy barriers of these steps are subject to debate. The presence of hydrogen in the PDH process can influence the formation of propylene and the graphitization degree of coke species.

This uncertainty affects the detailed understanding of the PDH mechanism and optimization of the reaction conditions for efficient propane conversion to propylene.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step, where the propane molecule is split into hydrogen and a carbene fragment, is often debated as potentially being the rate-controlling step. The β-H extraction step follows, where the hydrogen atom is abstracted from the carbene fragment, and the final step is the desorption of the resulting propylene molecule. The uncertainty regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

The mechanism starts with the dissociative adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface, followed by the extraction of a β-H atom during the dehydrogenation process, and concludes with the desorption of the resulting olefin. The debate around whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH is significant because it affects our understanding of the reaction pathway and the mechanism driving the reaction. This uncertainty has implications for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH processes.

The lack of clear consensus on the rate-controlling step impacts the field in several ways. First, it hinders the optimization of existing catalysts and the design of new ones. Catalysts might perform differently under various operating conditions, and understanding the rate-controlling step is essential for predicting and controlling their behavior. Second, it limits the development of kinetic models that accurately describe the PDH process. Kinetic models are critical tools for simulating reaction dynamics, guiding experiments, and informing the rational design of catalysts. Lastly, it affects the interpretation of experimental data and the extrapolation of results to industrial-scale operations. Accurate mechanistic understanding is crucial for scaling up reactions efficiently and economically.

To advance the field, researchers need to conduct more detailed kinetic studies, employing advanced techniques such as operando spectroscopy and in situ characterization methods. These studies should aim to resolve the mechanistic details of the PDH process, particularly the relative contributions of dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction. By gaining a deeper understanding of these steps, scientists can develop more accurate kinetic models and design catalysts that are optimized for specific conditions, leading to improved performance and efficiency in PDH processes.

### Question: Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

#### Answer:

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps:

1. **Dissociative Adsorption**: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface in a dissociative manner, leading to the formation of a partially adsorbed propane species. This step is characterized by the breaking of some chemical bonds within the propane molecule, making it more reactive.

2. **β-H Extraction**: Once adsorbed, the second hydrogen (β-H) is extracted from the partially adsorbed propane species. This hydrogen is typically released into the gas phase, leaving behind an alkyl radical.

3. **Desorption**: The resulting alkyl radical undergoes desorption from the catalyst surface. This final step releases the product olefin back into the gas phase.

**Debate on Rate-Controling Step**:

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which of these three steps—dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, or desorption—is the rate-limiting step in the PDH process. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH mechanism in several ways:

- **Kinetic Analysis**: Accurate identification of the rate-controlling step is essential for kinetic modeling and understanding the overall reaction rate. Misidentification can lead to inaccurate predictions of reaction kinetics and product yields.

- **Catalyst Design**: Knowledge of the rate-controlling step guides the design of catalysts that are optimized for specific reaction steps. For example, if β-H extraction is rate-limiting, catalysts might be engineered to facilitate this step more efficiently.

- **Mechanism Clarification**: Precise understanding of the rate-controlling step can clarify the mechanism of the PDH reaction, helping to elucidate the role of different catalyst components and reaction intermediates.

### Question: How does the co-feeding of hydrogen influence the catalytic performance of PDH reactions, specifically in terms of olefin selectivity and coke formation?

#### Answer:

The co-feeding of hydrogen in PDH reactions has several positive effects on catalytic performance:

- **Increased Olefin Selectivity**: Hydrogen can decrease the graphitization degree of coke species, thereby reducing the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to the formation of heavier hydrocarbons. This helps maintain higher olefin selectivity.

- **Reduced Coke Formation**: A moderate amount of hydrogen can decrease the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors such as ethylidyne and methylidyne species on the catalyst surface, thus reducing the formation of coke. This maintains the activity and stability of the catalyst over multiple reaction cycles.

- **Balanced Reaction Dynamics**: Hydrogen can accelerate the propylene formation rate while simultaneously reducing the consumption of the formed propylene, indicating a dual role in enhancing the efficiency of the PDH reaction. This is achieved by shifting the third CH cleavage step to higher energy, which competes less with the preferred olefin desorption.

The co-feeding of hydrogen thus plays a critical role in balancing olefin selectivity and coke formation, contributing to the overall efficiency and longevity of PDH reactions.

### Question: What are the key factors that impact the stability and selectivity of PDH catalysts, and how do these factors relate to the structure and properties of the catalysts themselves?

#### Answer:

The stability and selectivity of PDH catalysts are influenced by several key factors, primarily related to the structure and properties of the catalyst itself:

1. **Surface Acid Sites**: The presence and nature of surface acid sites on the catalyst can significantly impact the stability and selectivity. Strong acid sites may catalyze unwanted deep dehydrogenation or oligomerization reactions, reducing olefin selectivity and increasing coke formation.

2. **Metal Species**: The type, size, and distribution of metal species (such as Pt, Cr, Fe, Sn, etc.) on the catalyst surface are crucial. Metal species that are well localized, isolated, or confined within the catalyst structure tend to exhibit higher stability and selectivity.

3. **Support Material**: The support material interacts with the metal species, affecting their stability and activity. Supports with low acidity, such as high-silica zeolites or pure silica, can help localize metal sites and reduce coke formation.

4. **Promoter Addition**: Promoter elements can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst, impacting the adsorption and reaction of substrates. They can also help prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization.

5. **Regeneration Conditions**: The effectiveness of regeneration processes, particularly under oxidative conditions, can impact the catalyst's ability to retain its activity and stability over multiple cycles.

Understanding and optimizing these factors requires a deep insight into the structure-property relationships of the catalysts, guiding the development of more efficient and stable PDH catalysts.

### Question: How do the co-feeding of hydrogen and steam vapor influence the catalytic performance of PDH reactions, specifically in terms of olefin selectivity and coke formation?

#### Answer:

The co-feeding of hydrogen and steam vapor in PDH reactions has a significant influence on the catalytic performance, particularly in terms of olefin selectivity and coke formation:

- **Hydrogen Impact**: Hydrogen can increase olefin selectivity by decreasing the graphitization degree of coke species, which reduces the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation reactions. It also decreases the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors, minimizing the formation of coke.

- **Steam Vapor Influence**: Steam vapor can reduce the amount of coke formed during the PDH reactions. By competing with hydrocarbons for adsorption sites and participating in reactions that can remove coke precursors, steam vapor helps maintain the activity and stability of the catalyst.

- **Combined Effect**: The co-feeding of hydrogen and steam vapor can synergistically enhance the catalytic performance of PDH reactions. Hydrogen improves olefin selectivity and reduces coke formation, while steam vapor further reduces coke formation, contributing to the overall efficiency and longevity of the PDH process.

These gases, by competing with hydrocarbons and participating in reactions, play a crucial role in maintaining high olefin selectivity and preventing excessive coke formation, thus supporting the stability and efficiency of PDH reactions.

### 问题：解释丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制，详细说明其三个步骤（离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附），并批判性地讨论目前关于吸附过程或β-H提取是速率限制步骤的争论。这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程的理解？

#### 答案：

PDH反应的逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制涉及三个连续步骤：

[1] "For the EDH reactions on the PtSn monolayers with 1/4 and 1/2 coverages on the Pt(111) surface, the potential energy surfaces for all C1 and C2 derivatives from ethane CH and CC bond cleavage suggest that the binding energies of all these species can be weakened in the presence of the Sn promoter."
[2] "The kinetic analyses demonstrate that the reaction order of propane is 1 for all ranges of catalysts, whereas that of hydrogen is different, which varies from 0.07 to 0.57 for 39 nm Pt clusters (Fig. 1b and c)."
[3] "The smaller and larger clusters are dominated by the (211) and (111) planes of Pt, respectively. According to the DFT calculation results, the Pt(211) sites display a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, while the Pt(111) sites exhibit a weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the deep dehydrogenation of propylene."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism suggests that the first step involves the dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the propane molecule, leading to the formation of a propylene molecule and a hydrogen atom on the surface. Finally, the propylene molecule is desorbed from the surface. The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the development of efficient catalysts and reaction conditions. It necessitates further investigation into the detailed kinetics and mechanisms involved in each step to optimize the PDH reaction.
