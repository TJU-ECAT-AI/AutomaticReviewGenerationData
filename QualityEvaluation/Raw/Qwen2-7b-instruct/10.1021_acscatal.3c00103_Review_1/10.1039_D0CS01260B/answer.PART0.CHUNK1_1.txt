The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate around which step is the rate-controlling process impacts our understanding of PDH. The literature does not explicitly resolve this debate, leaving it open for further investigation.

The dissociative adsorption of propane onto a catalyst surface is followed by the extraction of a β-H atom, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical and a hydrogen molecule. This step is influenced by the catalyst's surface properties, such as its d-band center, and can lead to the formation of either a 1- or 2-propyl intermediate, depending on the catalyst's nature. The adsorption of the resulting olefin intermediate on the catalyst's surface can occur through π- or di-σ binding, depending on the catalyst's surface characteristics, temperature, pressure, and the composition of co-fed gases.

The CH activation and olefin desorption processes are essential for achieving high olefin selectivity and long-term stability in PDH reactions. Metals and metal oxides exhibit different specific reaction rates for PDH. Monometallic platinum (Pt) and bimetallic systems like PtSn often show significantly higher rates (101 s<sup>-1</sup>) compared to metal oxide-based catalysts (10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The strength of olefin adsorption onto the Pt surface is determined by the geometric and electronic properties of the Pt atoms.

Strong acid sites on the catalyst surface can tightly bind with olefin intermediates, facilitating their transformation into coke precursors through processes like deep dehydrogenation or oligomerization. This significantly affects the selectivity and stability of the dehydrogenation process. The literature proposes a monolayer-multilayer coke growth model to describe the activity-coke content relationship over catalysts like Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。文献没有明确解决这一争论，留待进一步研究。

PDH过程包括丙烷在催化剂表面的解离吸附，随后从分子中提取一个β-H原子，形成一个烷基自由基和一个氢分子。该步骤受到催化剂表面性质的影响，如其d带中心，可能导致形成1-或2-丙基中间体，具体取决于催化剂的性质。形成的烯烃中间体在催化剂表面的吸附可以是π型或di-σ型，具体取决于催化剂的表面特性、温度、压力以及共喂气体的组成。

CH活化和烯烃脱附过程对于实现高烯烃选择性和长期稳定性至关重要。金属和金属氧化物表现出不同的PDH特定反应速率。单金属铂（Pt）和二元系统如PtSn通常显示比金属氧化物基催化剂（10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>）更高的速率（101 s<sup>-1</sup>）。烯烃在Pt表面的吸附强度由Pt原子的几何和电子性质决定。

催化剂表面的强酸性位点可以紧密地与烯烃中间体结合，促进它们转化为焦炭前体，通过深脱氢或聚合等过程。这显著影响了脱氢过程的选择性和稳定性。文献提出了一个单层-多层焦炭生长模型来描述Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>催化剂的活性-焦炭含量关系。
