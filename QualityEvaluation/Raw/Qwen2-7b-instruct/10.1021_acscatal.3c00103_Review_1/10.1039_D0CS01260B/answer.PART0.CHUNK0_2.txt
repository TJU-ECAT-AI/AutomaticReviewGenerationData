[1] "The binding energies of the weakest CH bonds are 444 and 361 kJ mol1 for ethylene and propylene, respectively. Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
[2] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
[3] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
[4] "In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades."
[5] "Several heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, metal oxides and carbon materials have also attracted wide attention for the PDH reactions in recent years."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step, where the propane molecule is split into hydrogen and a carbene fragment, is often debated as potentially being the rate-controlling step. The β-H extraction step follows, where the hydrogen atom is abstracted from the carbene fragment, and the final step is the desorption of the resulting propylene molecule. The uncertainty regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This ambiguity influences the design and optimization of catalysts, particularly those based on PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 technologies, which are crucial for the commercial production of propylene from propane.

反霍里乌蒂-波纳尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附步骤，即丙烷分子被分解成氢和一个碳烯片段，经常被辩论为可能是速率控制步骤。随后的β-H提取步骤中，氢原子从碳烯片段中被抽取出来，最后一步是将形成的丙烯分子释放出来。关于离解吸附步骤或β-H提取步骤是否是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种模糊性影响了催化剂的设计和优化，特别是基于PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3技术的催化剂，这些催化剂对于从丙烷生产丙烯至关重要。
