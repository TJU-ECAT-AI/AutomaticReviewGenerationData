2.2.2. VOx In consideration of the low-price and high-reactivity, the supported VOx catalysts are believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in the selective DH reactions of light alkanes into olefins. In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration.133 

2.3. Co and CoOx For the Co-catalyzed activation and functionalization of CH bonds in the hydrocarbons, such as direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and cycloalkanes, their development has achieved notable success.169 The metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes.170176

2.3.1. Fe and FeOx Al2O3-supported Fe and Fe2+ species obtained from the pre-reduction of the 10FeAl catalyst by CO or H2 are catalytically active and selective for PDH reactions, because of the elimination of the surface electronegative oxygen species that are responsible for suppressing the propylene cracking and the formation of coke species.193

2.3.2. Sn and SnOx The promotion effects of Sn species in Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts through the geometric and electronic modifications have been widely studied since 1960s, as discussed in the previous sections. However, Sn alone can play the role of the active sites in the dehydrogenation reactions instead of the promoters (Table 5).203207

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption of propane, β-H extraction, and desorption of olefin. The literature discusses ongoing debates regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty about the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the most effective catalysts and operating conditions. It is unclear whether the slowest step is the adsorption of propane, the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H extraction), or the desorption of the resulting olefin product. This lack of clarity hinders the optimization of the PDH process and the development of more efficient catalysts.

To address this uncertainty, researchers need to conduct more detailed kinetic studies to determine the rate-controlling step. This might involve measuring the reaction rates under various conditions, such as different temperatures, pressures, or concentrations of reactants. Additionally, computational modeling could be employed to simulate the PDH mechanism and estimate the activation energies for each step. Understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for developing more effective catalysts and optimizing the PDH process for practical applications.

PDH逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个步骤：丙烷的离散吸附、β-H提取和烯烃的脱附。文献讨论了PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤的持续争议。速率控制步骤的不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定最有效的催化剂和操作条件变得复杂。不清楚慢速步骤是丙烷的吸附、β-H提取还是产物烯烃的脱附。这种模糊性阻碍了PDH过程的优化和更有效催化剂的发展。

为了解决这个不确定性，研究人员需要进行更详细的动力学研究来确定速率控制步骤。这可能涉及在不同温度、压力或反应物浓度下测量反应速率。此外，可以使用计算模型模拟PDH机制并估算每个步骤的活化能。理解速率控制步骤对于开发更有效的催化剂和优化PDH过程以满足实际应用需求至关重要。
