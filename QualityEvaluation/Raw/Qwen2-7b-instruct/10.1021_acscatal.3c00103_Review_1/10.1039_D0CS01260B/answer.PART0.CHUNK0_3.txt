[1] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."
[2] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
[3] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
[4] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism starts with the dissociative adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface, followed by the extraction of a β-H atom during the dehydrogenation process, and concludes with the desorption of the resulting olefin. The debate around whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH is significant because it affects our understanding of the reaction pathway and the mechanism driving the reaction. This uncertainty has implications for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH processes.

The lack of clear consensus on the rate-controlling step impacts the field in several ways. First, it hinders the optimization of existing catalysts and the design of new ones. Catalysts might perform differently under various operating conditions, and understanding the rate-controlling step is essential for predicting and controlling their behavior. Second, it limits the development of kinetic models that accurately describe the PDH process. Kinetic models are critical tools for simulating reaction dynamics, guiding experiments, and informing the rational design of catalysts. Lastly, it affects the interpretation of experimental data and the extrapolation of results to industrial-scale operations. Accurate mechanistic understanding is crucial for scaling up reactions efficiently and economically.

To advance the field, researchers need to conduct more detailed kinetic studies, employing advanced techniques such as operando spectroscopy and in situ characterization methods. These studies should aim to resolve the mechanistic details of the PDH process, particularly the relative contributions of dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction. By gaining a deeper understanding of these steps, scientists can develop more accurate kinetic models and design catalysts that are optimized for specific conditions, leading to improved performance and efficiency in PDH processes.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个连续步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制从丙烷在催化剂表面的解离吸附开始，随后进行脱氢过程中的β-H原子提取，最后是产物烯烃的脱附。关于PDH中解离吸附或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争议具有重要意义，因为它影响我们对反应路径和驱动机制的理解。这种不确定性对PDH过程产生了影响。

这种争议对领域的影响主要体现在以下几个方面。首先，它阻碍了现有催化剂的优化和新催化剂的设计。在不同的操作条件下，催化剂可能表现出不同的性能，理解速率控制步骤对于预测和控制它们的行为至关重要。其次，它限制了准确描述PDH过程的动态的开发。动力学模型是模拟反应动态、指导实验和指导催化剂设计的重要工具。最后，它影响了实验数据的解释和结果向工业规模操作的外推。准确的机理理解对于高效经济地放大反应至关重要。

为了推动这一领域的发展，研究人员需要进行更详细的动力学研究，并采用先进的技术如原位光谱法和表征方法。这些研究应该旨在解决PDH过程的细节，特别是解离吸附和β-H提取的相对贡献。通过深入了解这些步骤，科学家可以开发更准确的动力学模型，并设计优化特定条件的催化剂，从而提高PDH过程的性能和效率。
