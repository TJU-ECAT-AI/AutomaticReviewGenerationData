[1] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."
[2] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
[3] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond between propane and the catalyst surface, β-H extraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, and desorption is the release of the resulting olefin product. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step is ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency of the reaction and the selectivity towards olefin products. The precise nature of these steps and their relative rates of occurrence can significantly affect the performance of PDH catalysts and the optimization of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波纳尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及到在催化剂表面破坏丙烷分子与表面之间的氢键，β-H提取涉及到从吸附的丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子，脱附是释放形成的结果烯烃产物的过程。关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的辩论正在进行。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和向烯烃产品的选择性。这些步骤的精确性质及其发生的相对速率可以显著影响PDH催化剂的性能和PDH过程的优化。
