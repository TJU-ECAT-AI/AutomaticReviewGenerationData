[1] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties."
[2] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
[3] "The binding energies of the weakest CH bonds are 444 and 361 kJ mol1 for ethylene and propylene, respectively."
[4] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
[5] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The process starts with the dissociative adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface. Next, the β-H extraction takes place, leading to the cleavage of the propane molecule. Finally, the desorption of the resulting olefin products occurs. There is ongoing debate in the scientific community about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty significantly impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the design of efficient catalysts and the prediction of reaction kinetics. The catalyst's ability to efficiently activate and deactivate the reactants and products is crucial for achieving high selectivity and stability in the PDH reaction.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个连续步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。过程从丙烷在催化剂表面的解离吸附开始。接下来，进行β-H提取，导致丙烷分子的断裂。最后，产物烯烃的脱附发生。科学界对逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制中哪个步骤是控制速率的关键存在持续的争论：是解离吸附还是β-H提取。这一不确定性显著影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了高效催化剂的设计以及对反应动力学的预测。催化剂能够有效地激活和去活反应物和产物的能力对于实现PDH反应的高选择性和稳定性至关重要。
