[1] "For the PDH reactions over a variety of nobble metal and transition metal oxide catalysts, the corresponding catalytic mechanisms have been compared in a review reported by Weckhuysen et al. in 2014.8 As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen."

[2] "According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step.8"

[3] "The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt."

[4] "The specific rate values (mol propane per mol metal per s) of the PDH reactions catalyzed by metals and metal oxides, the monometallic Pt and the bimetallic sites like PtSn typically show the highest rates of 10^1 s−1, which are four or three orders of magnitude greater than the 10^5–10^4 s−1 rates obtained on the metal oxide-based active sites."

[5] "The strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces may tightly bond with olefin intermediates, allowing their further transformation such as deep dehydrogenation or oligomerization for the formation of coke precursors, and therefore significantly influencing the DH selectivity and catalytic stability."

[6] "The co-feeding of hydrogen is widely adopted in the catalytic EDH and PDH reactions in view of the multiple positive roles of hydrogen."

### Question: Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

#### Answer:

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps:

1. **Dissociative Adsorption**: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface in a dissociative manner, leading to the formation of a partially adsorbed propane species. This step is characterized by the breaking of some chemical bonds within the propane molecule, making it more reactive.

2. **β-H Extraction**: Once adsorbed, the second hydrogen (β-H) is extracted from the partially adsorbed propane species. This hydrogen is typically released into the gas phase, leaving behind an alkyl radical.

3. **Desorption**: The resulting alkyl radical undergoes desorption from the catalyst surface. This final step releases the product olefin back into the gas phase.

**Debate on Rate-Controling Step**:

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which of these three steps—dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, or desorption—is the rate-limiting step in the PDH process. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH mechanism in several ways:

- **Kinetic Analysis**: Accurate identification of the rate-controlling step is essential for kinetic modeling and understanding the overall reaction rate. Misidentification can lead to inaccurate predictions of reaction kinetics and product yields.

- **Catalyst Design**: Knowledge of the rate-controlling step guides the design of catalysts that are optimized for specific reaction steps. For example, if β-H extraction is rate-limiting, catalysts might be engineered to facilitate this step more efficiently.

- **Mechanism Clarification**: Precise understanding of the rate-controlling step can clarify the mechanism of the PDH reaction, helping to elucidate the role of different catalyst components and reaction intermediates.

### Question: How does the co-feeding of hydrogen influence the catalytic performance of PDH reactions, specifically in terms of olefin selectivity and coke formation?

#### Answer:

The co-feeding of hydrogen in PDH reactions has several positive effects on catalytic performance:

- **Increased Olefin Selectivity**: Hydrogen can decrease the graphitization degree of coke species, thereby reducing the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to the formation of heavier hydrocarbons. This helps maintain higher olefin selectivity.

- **Reduced Coke Formation**: A moderate amount of hydrogen can decrease the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors such as ethylidyne and methylidyne species on the catalyst surface, thus reducing the formation of coke. This maintains the activity and stability of the catalyst over multiple reaction cycles.

- **Balanced Reaction Dynamics**: Hydrogen can accelerate the propylene formation rate while simultaneously reducing the consumption of the formed propylene, indicating a dual role in enhancing the efficiency of the PDH reaction. This is achieved by shifting the third CH cleavage step to higher energy, which competes less with the preferred olefin desorption.

The co-feeding of hydrogen thus plays a critical role in balancing olefin selectivity and coke formation, contributing to the overall efficiency and longevity of PDH reactions.

### Question: What are the key factors that impact the stability and selectivity of PDH catalysts, and how do these factors relate to the structure and properties of the catalysts themselves?

#### Answer:

The stability and selectivity of PDH catalysts are influenced by several key factors, primarily related to the structure and properties of the catalyst itself:

1. **Surface Acid Sites**: The presence and nature of surface acid sites on the catalyst can significantly impact the stability and selectivity. Strong acid sites may catalyze unwanted deep dehydrogenation or oligomerization reactions, reducing olefin selectivity and increasing coke formation.

2. **Metal Species**: The type, size, and distribution of metal species (such as Pt, Cr, Fe, Sn, etc.) on the catalyst surface are crucial. Metal species that are well localized, isolated, or confined within the catalyst structure tend to exhibit higher stability and selectivity.

3. **Support Material**: The support material interacts with the metal species, affecting their stability and activity. Supports with low acidity, such as high-silica zeolites or pure silica, can help localize metal sites and reduce coke formation.

4. **Promoter Addition**: Promoter elements can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst, impacting the adsorption and reaction of substrates. They can also help prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization.

5. **Regeneration Conditions**: The effectiveness of regeneration processes, particularly under oxidative conditions, can impact the catalyst's ability to retain its activity and stability over multiple cycles.

Understanding and optimizing these factors requires a deep insight into the structure-property relationships of the catalysts, guiding the development of more efficient and stable PDH catalysts.

### Question: How do the co-feeding of hydrogen and steam vapor influence the catalytic performance of PDH reactions, specifically in terms of olefin selectivity and coke formation?

#### Answer:

The co-feeding of hydrogen and steam vapor in PDH reactions has a significant influence on the catalytic performance, particularly in terms of olefin selectivity and coke formation:

- **Hydrogen Impact**: Hydrogen can increase olefin selectivity by decreasing the graphitization degree of coke species, which reduces the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation reactions. It also decreases the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors, minimizing the formation of coke.

- **Steam Vapor Influence**: Steam vapor can reduce the amount of coke formed during the PDH reactions. By competing with hydrocarbons for adsorption sites and participating in reactions that can remove coke precursors, steam vapor helps maintain the activity and stability of the catalyst.

- **Combined Effect**: The co-feeding of hydrogen and steam vapor can synergistically enhance the catalytic performance of PDH reactions. Hydrogen improves olefin selectivity and reduces coke formation, while steam vapor further reduces coke formation, contributing to the overall efficiency and longevity of the PDH process.

These gases, by competing with hydrocarbons and participating in reactions, play a crucial role in maintaining high olefin selectivity and preventing excessive coke formation, thus supporting the stability and efficiency of PDH reactions.
