[1] "For the EDH reactions on the PtSn monolayers with 1/4 and 1/2 coverages on the Pt(111) surface, the potential energy surfaces for all C1 and C2 derivatives from ethane CH and CC bond cleavage suggest that the binding energies of all these species can be weakened in the presence of the Sn promoter."
[2] "The kinetic analyses demonstrate that the reaction order of propane is 1 for all ranges of catalysts, whereas that of hydrogen is different, which varies from 0.07 to 0.57 for 39 nm Pt clusters (Fig. 1b and c)."
[3] "The smaller and larger clusters are dominated by the (211) and (111) planes of Pt, respectively. According to the DFT calculation results, the Pt(211) sites display a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, while the Pt(111) sites exhibit a weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the deep dehydrogenation of propylene."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism suggests that the first step involves the dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the propane molecule, leading to the formation of a propylene molecule and a hydrogen atom on the surface. Finally, the propylene molecule is desorbed from the surface. The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the development of efficient catalysts and reaction conditions. It necessitates further investigation into the detailed kinetics and mechanisms involved in each step to optimize the PDH reaction.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及的三个连续步骤：离解吸附，β-H提取和脱附。该机制认为第一步是丙烷分子在催化剂表面的离解吸附。随后进行β-H提取，从丙烷分子中抽取一个氢原子，形成丙烯分子和表面氢原子。最后，丙烯分子从表面脱附。关于这一步骤中的哪一步，即离解吸附或β-H提取，是控制速率的关键步骤，存在争议。不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使开发高效催化剂和反应条件变得复杂。需要进一步研究每个步骤的详细动力学和机制，以优化PDH反应。
