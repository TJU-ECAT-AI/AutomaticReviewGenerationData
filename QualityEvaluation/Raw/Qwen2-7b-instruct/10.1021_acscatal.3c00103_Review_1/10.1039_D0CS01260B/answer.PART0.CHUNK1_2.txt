[1] "For the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction."
[2] "For the adsorption of propane and propylene on the Pt sites, the adsorption strength is determined by the geometric and electronic properties of Pt."
[3] "In the case of the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reactions, the presence of hydrogen increases the propylene formation rate and decreases both the formation rate and the graphitization degree of coke species."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty regarding which step is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. 

Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface with the breaking of one or more hydrogen bonds. The β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, followed by the desorption of the resulting olefin. The exact sequence and relative energy barriers of these steps are subject to debate. The presence of hydrogen in the PDH process can influence the formation of propylene and the graphitization degree of coke species.

This uncertainty affects the detailed understanding of the PDH mechanism and optimization of the reaction conditions for efficient propane conversion to propylene.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪个步骤是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了对PDH过程的理解。

解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附并断裂一个或多个氢键的过程。β-H提取是从吸附的丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子，随后脱附生成的烯烃。这些步骤的确切顺序及其能量壁垒存在争议。在PDH过程中氢的存在可以影响丙烯的形成和焦炭物种的石墨化程度。

这种不确定性影响了PDH机制的详细理解以及反应条件的优化以实现高效的丙烷转化为丙烯。
