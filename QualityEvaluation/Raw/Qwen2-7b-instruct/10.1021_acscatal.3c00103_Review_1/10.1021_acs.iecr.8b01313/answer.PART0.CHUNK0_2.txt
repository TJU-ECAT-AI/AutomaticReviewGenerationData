The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate about which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty affects our comprehension of the PDH process.
