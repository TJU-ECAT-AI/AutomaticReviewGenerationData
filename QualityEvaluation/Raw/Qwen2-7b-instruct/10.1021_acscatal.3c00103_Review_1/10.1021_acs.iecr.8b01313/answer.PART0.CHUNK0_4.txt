[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "The ongoing debate centers around which step is the rate-controlling one, with proponents of both the dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction processes presenting strong arguments."
[3] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty affects our understanding of the PDH process by revealing the intricate nature of the reaction mechanisms.
