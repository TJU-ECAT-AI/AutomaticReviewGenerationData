[1] "The distinction into these three phases is qualitative, and the specific time for the transition from one phase to another depends on the metal, support, and gas atmosphere."
[2] "When particles are very small (diameter d < 3 nm), they are expected to be mobile, and this could be a possible explanation for the rapid sintering seen in phase I."
[3] "As particles grow in size, they become more stable (3 < d < 10 nm) and sintering slows down, as in phase II."
[4] "In the later stages, particles can grow quite large (d > 10 nm) and they are most likely immobile, suggesting that atom transfer is the most likely mechanism."

Answer: The three phases of catalyst sintering are characterized by different behaviors of metal nanoparticles. In the early stage (phase I), when particles are very small, they are mobile and this leads to rapid sintering. As particles grow in size (phase II), they become more stable, causing sintering to slow down. In the later stages (phase III), when particles are large, they are immobile, and sintering is primarily caused by atom transfer.

三个阶段的催化剂烧结分别由不同大小的金属纳米颗粒的行为特征化。在早期阶段（第一阶段），当颗粒非常小时，它们是可移动的，这导致快速烧结。随着颗粒增大（第二阶段），它们变得更加稳定，导致烧结速度减慢。在后期阶段（第三阶段），当颗粒很大时，它们是不可移动的，烧结主要是由原子转移引起的。
