[1] "The distinction into these three phases is qualitative, and the specific time for the transition from one phase to another depends on the metal, support, and gas atmosphere."
[2] "Phase I: Is the rapid decay in activity in the early stage of sintering caused by migration and coalescence of particles?"
[3] "Phase II: Why does sintering slow down?"
[4] "Phase III: Do catalysts reach a stable, equilibrium dispersion (or particle size)?"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Phase I refers to the rapid decay in catalyst activity during the early stages of sintering, which is caused by migration and coalescence of particles. In Phase II, the rate of sintering slows down as particles grow in size and interparticle separation increases. Phase III concerns whether catalysts reach a stable, equilibrium dispersion or particle size.

第一阶段指的是在催化剂烧结的早期阶段，活性迅速下降是由颗粒的迁移和聚集引起的。第二阶段中，随着颗粒增大和颗粒间距离增加，烧结速率逐渐减慢。第三阶段探讨催化剂是否达到稳定、平衡分散或颗粒大小。
