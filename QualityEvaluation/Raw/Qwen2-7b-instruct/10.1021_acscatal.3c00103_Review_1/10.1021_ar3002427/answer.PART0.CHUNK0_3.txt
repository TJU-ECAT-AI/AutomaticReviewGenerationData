[1] "The distinction into these three phases is qualitative, and the specific time for the transition from one phase to another depends on the metal, support, and gas atmosphere."
[2] "Phase I: Is the rapid decay in activity in the early stage of sintering caused by migration and coalescence of particles?"
[3] "Phase II: Why does sintering slow down?"
[4] "Phase III: Do catalysts reach a stable, equilibrium dispersion (or particle size)?"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The three phases of catalyst sintering refer to the rapid decay of surface area, the slowing down of sintering, and the potential for catalysts to reach a stable, equilibrium dispersion. The rapid decay in the early stage of sintering is caused by Ostwald ripening, not particle migration and coalescence. Sintering slows down as particles grow in size, and it is unclear whether catalysts ever reach a stable, equilibrium dispersion.

催化剂烧结的三个阶段指的是表面面积的快速衰减、烧结速率的减慢以及催化剂可能达到稳定的平衡分散度。早期阶段表面面积的快速衰减是由奥斯特瓦尔德成核造成的，而不是颗粒迁移和聚集。随着颗粒尺寸的增长，烧结速率减慢，不确定催化剂是否能达到稳定的平衡分散度。
