[1] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[2] "The higher rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite may be attributed to stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate around the mechanism centers on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty in this area impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction rates and the optimization of catalysts. The stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure, along with the presence of potassium, contributes to the higher reaction rates observed over Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite compared to silica-supported catalysts.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于该机制的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取是否是控制步骤。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使预测反应速率和催化剂优化变得复杂。在沸石微孔结构中的Pt/Sn簇上，异丁烷解离吸附/脱附激活复合物的稳定化，以及钾的存在，导致在沸石负载型催化剂中观察到较高的反应速率，与二氧化硅负载型催化剂相比。
