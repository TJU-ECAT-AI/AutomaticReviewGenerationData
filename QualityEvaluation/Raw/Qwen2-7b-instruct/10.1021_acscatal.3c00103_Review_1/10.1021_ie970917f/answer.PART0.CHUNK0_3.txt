[1] "The kinetic data for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[2] "The higher rates observed over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite may be attributed to stabilization of the activated complex involved in the dissociative adsorption/desorption of isobutane on the Pt/Sn clusters within the zeolite pore structure and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is considered rate-controlling in PDH. However, there is ongoing debate about whether this step or the β-H extraction is truly the rate-limiting step. The uncertainty around this impacts our understanding of the PDH process, particularly in terms of identifying the most efficient conditions for maximizing reaction rates and minimizing side reactions.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附步骤被认为是PDH中的控制步骤。然而，关于这个步骤或β-H提取是否真正是控制步骤存在持续的争议。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，特别是确定最大化反应速率并最小化副反应的最佳条件。
