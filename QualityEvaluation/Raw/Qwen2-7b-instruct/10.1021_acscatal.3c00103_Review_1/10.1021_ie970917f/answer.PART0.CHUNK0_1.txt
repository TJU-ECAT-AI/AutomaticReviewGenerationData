[1] "The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn enhances the rates of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation."
[2] "The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts could be described by a four-step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, with rate-limiting, dissociative adsorption of isobutane and quasi-equilibrated adsorption of hydrogen and isobutene."
[3] "The higher reaction rates over Pt/Sn/KL are caused by stabilization of the activated complex for isobutane dissociation on the small clusters of Pt/Sn in the zeolitic micropores and/or stabilization by the presence of potassium."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the key reaction mechanism and rate-determining step. The presence of potassium in the system stabilizes the activated complex for isobutane dissociation, contributing to higher reaction rates over Pt/Sn catalysts.

逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于离解吸附或β-H提取是否作为速率控制步骤的持续争议，影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为这使确定关键反应机制和速率决定步骤变得复杂。系统中钾的存在稳定了异丁烷离解的活化复合物，从而导致Pt/Sn催化剂上的反应速率更高。
