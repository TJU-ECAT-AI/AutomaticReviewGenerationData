Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism suggests that the first step, dissociative adsorption, where propane molecules break apart upon contact with the catalyst surface, is followed by β-H extraction, the removal of a hydrogen atom from one of the newly formed carbons, and finally, desorption, the release of the resulting products from the surface. The ongoing debate centers on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the primary rate-limiting step, which is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation reaction. The stabilization of adsorbed species on the small clusters of Pt/Sn within the zeolite micropores plays a significant role in increasing the reaction rates over Pt/Sn/KL and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 catalysts, suggesting that these conditions favor a more efficient and faster dehydrogenation process.

逆霍里图-波纳尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制表明，第一步是解离吸附，即丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时分解；第二步是β-H提取，即将一个氢原子从新形成的碳上移除；最后一步是脱附，即将产物从表面释放。关于是否解离吸附过程或β-H提取是PDH速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定主要速率限制步骤变得复杂，这对于优化催化剂性能和提高脱氢反应效率至关重要。Pt/Sn/KL和Pt/Sn/K/SiO2催化剂上的小Pt/Sn簇的微孔结构的吸附物种稳定化显著提高了这些催化剂的反应速率，这表明在这些条件下，脱氢过程更加高效且速度快。
