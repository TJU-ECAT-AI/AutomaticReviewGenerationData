The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . Such reactions are believed to proceed via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which reduced VOx centres that form during reaction are reoxidised by gas-phase oxygen. Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] .

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of the C-H bonds in propane molecules upon their attachment to the catalyst surface. β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, leading to the formation of propylene. Desorption is the final step, where the resulting propylene molecule detaches from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction governs the overall reaction rate. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of PDH by highlighting the importance of kinetic parameters and the role of surface chemistry in determining reaction rates. Understanding these processes could lead to the development of more efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

逆霍里乌蒂-波纳尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的重要步骤，包括三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及在催化剂表面吸附丙烷分子时，丙烷分子的C-H键断裂。随后是β-H提取过程，其中从吸附的丙烷分子中抽象出一个氢原子，形成丙烯。最后一步是脱附，形成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱离。关于速率控制步骤的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取是否决定了整个反应速率。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH的理解，突出了动力学参数和表面化学在确定反应速率中的重要性。理解这些过程可能有助于开发更高效的PDH催化剂。
