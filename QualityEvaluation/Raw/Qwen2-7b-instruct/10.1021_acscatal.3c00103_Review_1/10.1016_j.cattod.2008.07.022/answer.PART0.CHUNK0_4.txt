[1] "In the present work, regeneration of the catalysts has been carried out at 873 K, in order to remove the polynuclear aromatics that have formed during reaction."
[2] "The catalytic activity of the catalysts changes as a result of transformations to both the surface VOx species and the pure support, with vanadium appearing to catalyse a phase transformation in Al2O3 above 823 K."
[3] "However, such species are not however the principle source of catalyst deactivation, which can instead be assigned to tightly bound reaction intermediates."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate surrounding this mechanism centers on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of reaction conditions. The regeneration of catalysts at 873 K helps remove polynuclear aromatics formed during the reaction, but these species are not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Instead, tightly bound reaction intermediates are responsible for the catalyst's deactivation.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于这一机制的争论集中在离解吸附过程或β-H提取是否作为控制步骤。对控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使预测反应动力学和优化反应条件变得复杂。在873 K下再生催化剂有助于去除反应过程中形成的多核芳香族化合物，但这些化合物并不是催化剂失活的主要原因。相反，紧密结合的反应中间体才是导致催化剂失活的原因。
