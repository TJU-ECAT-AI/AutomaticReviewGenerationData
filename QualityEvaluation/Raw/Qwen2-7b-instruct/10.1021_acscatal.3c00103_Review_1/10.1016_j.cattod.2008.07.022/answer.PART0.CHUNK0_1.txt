The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials.
Despite this, there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts.
The main reactions occurring are the formation of retained carbon and the formation of butenes and butadienes.
More isolated VOx species show the greatest activity towards coke formation while polymeric VOx are the most active in the dehydrogenation reaction.
Reoxidation does not replace 100% of the oxygen removed during reduction, with lower loading catalysts taking up less oxygen, e.g. 1 V replaces 71% of the lost oxygen compared to 83% for 8 V.
It is clear that larger clusters of vanadia units are easier to reoxidise than smaller polymeric or monomeric units.
