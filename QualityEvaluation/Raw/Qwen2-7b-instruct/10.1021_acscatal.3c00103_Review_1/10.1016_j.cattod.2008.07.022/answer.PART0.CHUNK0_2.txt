[1] "Despite this, there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts."
[2] "Isolated vanadia species show high activity, but very low selectivity due to the undesirable formation of coke. Polymeric VOx species however show a greater selectivity towards the desired C4 dehydrogenation products."
[3] "The formation of polyolefinic coke species removed by high temperature regeneration are not however the principle source of catalyst deactivation, which can instead be assigned to tightly bound reaction intermediates."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule breaks down into a propylene radical and hydrogen. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propylene radical, and finally, desorption is the release of propylene from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps acts as the rate-limiting process. Uncertainty in this area impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the design of catalysts and reaction conditions. The importance of this debate lies in optimizing the reaction efficiency and product selectivity in industrial applications.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关键步骤，包括三步：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指丙烷分子分解为丙烯基自由基和氢原子的过程。β-H提取是从丙烯基自由基中移除一个氢原子，最后，脱附是在催化剂表面上释放丙烯的过程。科学界围绕这三个步骤中哪一步作为速率限制过程的辩论持续存在。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了催化剂设计和反应条件的选择。这个争议的重要性在于优化反应效率和产品选择性，在工业应用中至关重要。
