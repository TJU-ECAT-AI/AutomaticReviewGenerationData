The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials.
In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . Such reactions are believed to proceed via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which reduced VOx centres that form during reaction are reoxidised by gas-phase oxygen.
Despite this, there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts.
In this work we attempt to redress this through characterisation of a series of θ-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts at all stages during the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen: as-prepared, calcined, reduced, post-reaction and post-regeneration.
These data are then related to catalytic activity measurements providing insights into the relationship between surface VOx species and catalytic activity and selectivity.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface with the breaking of one or more C-H bonds. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, leading to the formation of propylene. Desorption is the final step where the resulting propylene molecule is released from the catalyst surface. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the reaction kinetics and efficiency. If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, the catalyst needs to efficiently break C-H bonds to allow for effective β-H extraction. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the catalyst must facilitate the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the adsorbed propane without hindering the adsorption process. This uncertainty guides the design and optimization of catalysts for PDH processes.

逆Horwuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：离解吸附，β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附的过程，伴随着一个或多个C-H键的断裂。β-H提取是后续步骤，其中从吸附的丙烷分子中抽象出一个氢原子，形成丙烯。脱附是最终步骤，其中产生的丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放出来。关于离解吸附是否是速率控制步骤的辩论影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应动力学和效率。如果离解吸附是限制性步骤，则催化剂需要有效地断开C-H键以允许有效的β-H提取。相反，如果β-H提取是速率控制步骤，则催化剂必须促进从吸附的丙烷中抽象氢原子，同时不阻碍吸附过程。这种不确定性指导PDH过程催化剂的设计和优化。

The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials.
Despite this, there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts.
The main reactions occurring are the formation of retained carbon and the formation of butenes and butadienes.
More isolated VOx species show the greatest activity towards coke formation while polymeric VOx are the most active in the dehydrogenation reaction.
Reoxidation does not replace 100% of the oxygen removed during reduction, with lower loading catalysts taking up less oxygen, e.g. 1 V replaces 71% of the lost oxygen compared to 83% for 8 V.
It is clear that larger clusters of vanadia units are easier to reoxidise than smaller polymeric or monomeric units.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule breaks down into a propylene radical and hydrogen. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propylene radical, and finally, desorption is the release of propylene from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying which of these steps acts as the rate-limiting process. Uncertainty in this area impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the design of catalysts and reaction conditions. The importance of this debate lies in optimizing the reaction efficiency and product selectivity in industrial applications.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of the C-H bonds in propane molecules upon their attachment to the catalyst surface. β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, leading to the formation of propylene. Desorption is the final step, where the resulting propylene molecule detaches from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction governs the overall reaction rate. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of PDH by highlighting the importance of kinetic parameters and the role of surface chemistry in determining reaction rates. Understanding these processes could lead to the development of more efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate surrounding this mechanism centers on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of reaction conditions. The regeneration of catalysts at 873 K helps remove polynuclear aromatics formed during the reaction, but these species are not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Instead, tightly bound reaction intermediates are responsible for the catalyst's deactivation.
