[1] "Developments in the theory of Ostwald ripening since the classic work of I. M. Lifshitz and V. V. Slyozov (LS) are reviewed and directions for future work are suggested."
[2] "New work on transient Ostwald ripening is presented which illustrates the broad range of behavior which is possible in this regime."
[3] "The role of elastic fields during Ostwald ripening in solid-solid mixtures is reviewed, and it is shown that these fields can play a dominant role in determining the coarsening behavior of a solid-solid system."
