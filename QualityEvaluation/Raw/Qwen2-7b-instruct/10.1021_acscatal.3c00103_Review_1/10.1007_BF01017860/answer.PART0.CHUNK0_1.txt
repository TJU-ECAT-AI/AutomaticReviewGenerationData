[1] "Although more theoretical work is necessary, these theories are in general agreement on the effects of a finite volume fraction of coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems."
[2] "New work on transient Ostwald ripening is presented which illustrates the broad range of behavior which is possible in this regime."
[3] "The conditions responsible for the presence of the asymptotic state first discovered by LS, as well as the manner in which this state is approached, are also discussed."

The theories reviewed in the document generally agree on the effects of a finite volume fraction of the coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems. This agreement includes the behavior observed in transient Ostwald ripening, the presence of the asymptotic state initially described by Lifshitz and Slyozov, and how this state is approached under different conditions.

在文档中回顾的理论在有限粗化相体积分数对两相系统粗化行为的影响方面总体上是一致的。这种一致性包括在瞬态奥斯特瓦尔德粗化过程中观察到的行为，LS首次描述的渐近状态的存在，以及如何在不同条件下接近这种状态。
