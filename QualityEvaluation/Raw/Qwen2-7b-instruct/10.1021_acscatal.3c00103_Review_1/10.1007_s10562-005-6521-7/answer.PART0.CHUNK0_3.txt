[1] "The results strongly indicate that this is not the case, and instead point to a traditional reaction cycle involving adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen."
[2] "Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of reaction."

Mechanistic Insight in the Ethane Dehydrogenation Reaction over Cr/Al2O3 Catalysts indicates that the initial activity increase during an ethane dehydrogenation cycle is not due to the formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface. Instead, it points to a traditional reaction cycle where ethane is adsorbed to form an ethyl species, followed by the desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The transient kinetic data suggests that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction.

催化活性Cr/Al2O3催化剂在乙烷脱氢反应中，最初的活性增加并非由于表面形成活性较大的烃类中间体。相反，这指向了一个传统的反应周期：乙烷吸附形成乙基物种，随后乙烯和氢气脱附。瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是反应的决定性步骤。

Since the provided literature does not contain information related to the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or the ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in this reaction, there is no relevant quote or answer to the second question.
