The mechanism of the ethane dehydrogenation reaction over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts involves adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The transient kinetic data indicates that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. Isotopic labeling experiments have been conducted to determine if the initial activity increase could be due to the formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface. However, the results suggest that this is not the case and that the traditional reaction cycle is more likely.

乙烷脱氢反应在Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的机制涉及乙烷的吸附形成乙基物种。随后是乙烯和氢的脱附。瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是反应的决定性步骤。进行了同位素标记实验来确定初始活性增加是否由于表面形成活性较大的烃中间体。然而，结果表明这并不是这种情况，更有可能的是传统的反应循环。
