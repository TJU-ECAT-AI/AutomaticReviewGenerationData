[1] "A Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst exhibits a maximum in ethylene yield during an ethane dehydrogenation cycle."
[2] "Isotopic labelling experiments with monolabelled 13C-ethane and deuterium were used to elucidate whether the initial activity increase could be due to formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface."
[3] "The results strongly indicate that this is not the case, and instead point to a traditional reaction cycle involving adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen."
[4] "Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, there is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty around this debate impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The cited literature focuses on ethane dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, hence it does not provide direct insights into the PDH mechanism. Nonetheless, it highlights the importance of understanding the adsorption process as it is a rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation reactions.

逆Horwuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。然而，关于该反应中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种辩论的不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。引用的文献关注于乙烷脱氢而不是丙烷脱氢，因此它没有直接提供关于PDH机制的信息。然而，它强调了理解吸附过程的重要性，因为这是脱氢反应中的决定性步骤。
