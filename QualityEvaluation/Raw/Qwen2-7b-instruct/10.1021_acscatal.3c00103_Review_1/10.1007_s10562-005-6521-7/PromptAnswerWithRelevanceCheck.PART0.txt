Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

[1] "A Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst exhibits a maximum in ethylene yield during an ethane dehydrogenation cycle."
[2] "Isotopic labelling experiments with monolabelled 13C-ethane and deuterium were used to elucidate whether the initial activity increase could be due to formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface."
[3] "The results strongly indicate that this is not the case, and instead point to a traditional reaction cycle involving adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen."
[4] "Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, the literature does not provide detailed information about this specific mechanism. It does discuss the ethane dehydrogenation reaction over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which involves adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The rate-determining step in the ethane dehydrogenation reaction is identified as ethane adsorption. This information might indirectly relate to the PDH process, but the specifics of the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and the debate about the rate-controlling step are not addressed in the provided literature.

反转Horiiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。然而，文献没有提供关于这个特定机制的详细信息。它讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的乙烷脱氢反应，该反应涉及将乙烷吸附形成乙基物种，随后脱附乙烯和氢气。乙烷脱氢反应的速率决定性步骤被确定为乙烷吸附。在提供的文献中，这种信息可能间接与PDH过程相关联，但关于速率控制步骤的具体争论并没有得到解决。

The mechanism of the ethane dehydrogenation reaction over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts involves adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species. This is followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The transient kinetic data indicates that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction. Isotopic labeling experiments have been conducted to determine if the initial activity increase could be due to the formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface. However, the results suggest that this is not the case and that the traditional reaction cycle is more likely.

乙烷脱氢反应在Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的机制涉及乙烷的吸附形成乙基物种。随后是乙烯和氢的脱附。瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是反应的决定性步骤。进行了同位素标记实验来确定初始活性增加是否由于表面形成活性较大的烃中间体。然而，结果表明这并不是这种情况，更有可能的是传统的反应循环。

Mechanistic Insight in the Ethane Dehydrogenation Reaction over Cr/Al2O3 Catalysts indicates that the initial activity increase during an ethane dehydrogenation cycle is not due to the formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface. Instead, it points to a traditional reaction cycle where ethane is adsorbed to form an ethyl species, followed by the desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The transient kinetic data suggests that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of the reaction.

催化活性Cr/Al2O3催化剂在乙烷脱氢反应中，最初的活性增加并非由于表面形成活性较大的烃类中间体。相反，这指向了一个传统的反应周期：乙烷吸附形成乙基物种，随后乙烯和氢气脱附。瞬态动力学数据表明，乙烷吸附是反应的决定性步骤。

Since the provided literature does not contain information related to the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or the ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in this reaction, there is no relevant quote or answer to the second question.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, there is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty around this debate impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The cited literature focuses on ethane dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, hence it does not provide direct insights into the PDH mechanism. Nonetheless, it highlights the importance of understanding the adsorption process as it is a rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation reactions.

逆Horwuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。然而，关于该反应中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种辩论的不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。引用的文献关注于乙烷脱氢而不是丙烷脱氢，因此它没有直接提供关于PDH机制的信息。然而，它强调了理解吸附过程的重要性，因为这是脱氢反应中的决定性步骤。
