[1] "A Cr/Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst exhibits a maximum in ethylene yield during an ethane dehydrogenation cycle."
[2] "Isotopic labelling experiments with monolabelled 13C-ethane and deuterium were used to elucidate whether the initial activity increase could be due to formation of an active, larger hydrocarbon intermediate on the surface."
[3] "The results strongly indicate that this is not the case, and instead point to a traditional reaction cycle involving adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen."
[4] "Transient kinetic data suggest that ethane adsorption is the rate-determining step of reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, the literature does not provide detailed information about this specific mechanism. It does discuss the ethane dehydrogenation reaction over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which involves adsorption of ethane to form an ethyl species, followed by desorption of ethene and hydrogen. The rate-determining step in the ethane dehydrogenation reaction is identified as ethane adsorption. This information might indirectly relate to the PDH process, but the specifics of the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and the debate about the rate-controlling step are not addressed in the provided literature.

反转Horiiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。然而，文献没有提供关于这个特定机制的详细信息。它讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的乙烷脱氢反应，该反应涉及将乙烷吸附形成乙基物种，随后脱附乙烯和氢气。乙烷脱氢反应的速率决定性步骤被确定为乙烷吸附。在提供的文献中，这种信息可能间接与PDH过程相关联，但关于速率控制步骤的具体争论并没有得到解决。
