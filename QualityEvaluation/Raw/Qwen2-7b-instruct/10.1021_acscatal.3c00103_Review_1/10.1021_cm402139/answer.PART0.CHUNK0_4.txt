[1] "The great synthetic potential for aggregative growth is that the nucleation process may be measured and manipulated."
[2] "Nucleation functions in aggregative growth have now been shown to determine nanocrystal sizes and size distributions."
[3] "Much remains to be learned about controlling the nucleation function, which is the key to nucleation control."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact nature of the rate-controlling step between dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction remains uncertain, leading to ongoing debate in the field. This uncertainty significantly impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the kinetics and the efficiency of the reaction.
