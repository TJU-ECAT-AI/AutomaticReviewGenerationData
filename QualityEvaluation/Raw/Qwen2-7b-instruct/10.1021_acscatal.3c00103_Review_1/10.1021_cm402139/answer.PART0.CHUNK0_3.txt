<p>The aggregative growth and oriented attachment of nanocrystals and nanoparticles are reviewed, and they are contrasted to classical LaMer nucleation and growth, and to Ostwald ripening. Kinetic and mechanistic models are presented, and experiments directly observing aggregative growth and oriented attachment are summarized. Aggregative growth is described as a nonclassical nucleation and growth process.</p>
<p>Studies of the formation mechanism of colloidal gold date back to 1951. (35) However, the modern era for mechanistic studies of nanocrystal growth appear to have begun in the mid-1990s. (36)</p>
<p>Finke and co-workers have published a series of experimental papers in which continuous nucleation and autocatalytic growth are proposed. (41-43)</p>
<p>Several experimental mechanistic studies have identified the participation of nanocrystal aggregation and coalescence in growth processes. (44-68)</p>
<p>In this review, we argue that advantages inherent in aggregative growth will potentially allow the systematic, rational control of nanocrystal size and size distribution to be achieved. In section 2, we summarize the conditions necessary to achieve such control, and we introduce the concept of a nucleation function.</p>
<p>For aggregative nucleation and growth from small primary nanocrystals, we have suggested that any additive that influences the colloidal stability of the nanocrystals may potentially vary the nucleation-rate behavior. (92, 94, 95)</p>
<p>Indeed, nucleation rates in protein crystallization have been controlled in this manner. (110-112)</p>
<p>In contrast, nucleation control in classical nucleation will require factors that influence the stability of monomer species consisting of a single to a few atoms, which are similar to reactive intermediates. They will not likely respond to polymer or ionic additives in the same manner as do primary nanocrystallites. Therefore, classical nucleation may be inherently more difficult to control, because the nucleation function is not as readily measured or manipulated. Nucleation control in nanocrystal growth by aggregative processes may be more readily achievable.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most-exciting recent development in mechanistic understanding of colloidal-nanocrystal nucleation and growth is the real-time visualization of growth trajectories of individual nanocrystals in dispersion, using a liquid cell in a TEM. In the first such study, Alivisatos and co-workers observed that colloidal platinum nanoparticles grew both by simple monomer attachment in solution and by particle coalescence. (44)</p>
<p>The study employed the precursor Pt(acetylacetonate)2 in a solution containing an oleylamine surfactant. The electron beam in the TEM induced the nucleation of platinum nanocrystals, which continued for over 10 s, such that nanocrystal growth temporally overlapped the nucleation period. Nanocrystals grew by both monomer addition and coalescence events. The number of nucleated nanocrystals reached a maximum at 21 s, and then significantly declined to a constant value. Nanocrystal aggregation and coalescence was primarily responsible for this decline. The aggregative growth also produced the expected bimodal size distribution at 24 s, which later resolved into a sharpened single mode.</p>
<p>As noted above, one also requires the means for purposeful variations of Δtn and Γmax, such that the height and width of the nucleation function may be controlled. For aggregative nucleation and growth from small primary nanocrystals, we have suggested that any additive that influences the colloidal stability of the nanocrystals may potentially vary the nucleation-rate behavior. (92, 94, 95)</p>
<p>The kinetics of diffusion-limited colloid aggregation (DLCA) (119-123) and reaction-limited colloid aggregation (RLCA) (124-131) have been studied since the early 1980s. In RLCA, a Smoluchowski rate equation, (55, 132) describing the time-dependent evolution of the number density of particles as a function of size as they aggregate, is often used to represent the aggregation probability as a function of the masses of two colliding clusters or particles.</p>
<p>Early time (nano)crystal-size distributions (CSDs) also provided strong evidence for aggregative growth in our studies of gold nanocrystal coarsening. (92) At times shortly after the end of the initial induction period, the CSDs were bimodal (Figure 6), with the smaller mode corresponding to the initial, primary nanocrystals, and the larger mode corresponding to critical-size aggregates of primary nanocrystals (aggregative nuclei; see below).</p>
<p>We used a modified KolmogorovJohnsonMehlAvrami (KJMA) expression to fit the sigmoidal profile in Figure 5 (eq 1), where Vlim is the nanocrystal mean volume at time t, Vlim is the final nanocrystal mean volume, and Vi is the primary-nanocrystal mean volume.</p>
<p>Other kinetic models for aggregative nanocrystal growth have been presented, which are summarized below.</p>
<p>Three modes of nanocrystal growth have been discussed here: classical (LaMer) nucleation and growth, aggregative growth, and Ostwald ripening (see Figure 3). In this subsection, we show that all three modes may contribute to a given nanocrystal-growth process, in successive temporal regimes and in the sequence given in Figure 3.</p>
<p>The important, early study by Bogush and Zukoski discussed above (see section 4) established that aggregative nucleation and growth is due to the colloidal instability, with respect to aggregation, of small primary nanoparticles. (55) Colloidal dispersions are generally stabilized against aggregation by steric or electrostatic repulsions, or their combination.</p>
<p>The nucleation functions depicted in Figure 12 enabled clear predictions about the final mean nanoparticle sizes and size distributions. Because Δtn narrowed with increasing TOABr concentration, so too should the dispersity of the final diameter distribution. That is, the width of the nucleation function and the width of the final size distribution should follow each other.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated a primitive form of nucleation control: systematic changes in nucleation functions induced systematic changes in the final nanoparticle sizes and size distributions. The strong correlations between the nucleation parameters extracted from the nucleation functions and the final outcomes of the growth trials provides compelling support for considering the initiation of aggregative growth to be a nucleation-like event (see subsection 4.4).</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate is whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. Uncertainty around this impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

The mechanism begins with the dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto a catalyst surface. This step involves breaking the C-C bonds in propane, creating reactive intermediates. The β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from one of the reactive intermediates, typically leading to the formation of propylene. The final step is desorption, where the resulting propylene molecule is released from the catalyst surface.

The key point of contention is whether the dissociative adsorption, which requires energy input, or the β-H extraction, which can occur spontaneously, governs the overall reaction rate. Different catalysts or conditions might favor one pathway over the other, affecting the efficiency of the PDH process. Understanding which step is rate-controlling helps in optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions for enhanced propylene production.

Uncertainty about this mechanism can lead to incomplete or inefficient processes in industrial settings. It necessitates further research to clarify the kinetic details and optimize the PDH process. This includes understanding the specific conditions under which one step dominates over the other, which catalyst properties favor certain pathways, and how to manipulate these factors to enhance propylene yield and selectivity.

In summary, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process, highlighting the need for further research to optimize the process and enhance propylene production.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的一种途径，涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于这一机制中哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响着我们对PDH过程的理解。

该机制开始于丙烷分子在催化剂表面的解离吸附。这一步涉及断裂丙烷中的C-C键，产生活性中间体。随后进行β-H提取，从一个活性中间体中抽取一个氢原子，通常形成丙烯。最后一步是脱附，生成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放出来。

关键点在于，需要能量输入的解离吸附步骤或可以自发发生的β-H提取步骤哪一个控制整体反应速率。不同的催化剂或条件可能偏向于优先发生某一步，影响PDH过程的效率。理解哪一步是速率控制步骤有助于优化催化剂设计和反应条件，以提高丙烯产量和选择性。

这种不确定性导致工业应用中的不完整或低效过程。它需要进一步的研究来澄清动力学细节并优化PDH过程。这包括了解特定条件下哪一步占主导地位，哪些催化剂属性有利于特定路径，以及如何调整这些因素以增强丙烯产率和选择性。

简而言之，反霍里图-波兰尼机制的PDH过程涉及解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附三个步骤。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论影响着我们对PDH过程的理解，强调了进一步研究以优化过程和提高丙烯产量的重要性。
