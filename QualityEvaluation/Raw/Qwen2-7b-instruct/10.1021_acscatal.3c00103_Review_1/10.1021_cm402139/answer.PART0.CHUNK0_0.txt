The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty has significant implications for our understanding of the PDH process, influencing the design of catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions. Clarifying the rate-controlling step is essential for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction.
