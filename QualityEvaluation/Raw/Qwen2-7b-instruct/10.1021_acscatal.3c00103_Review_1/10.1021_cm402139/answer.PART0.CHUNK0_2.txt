The review discusses the importance of controlling the nucleation function for achieving purposeful control over the final mean sizes and size distributions of nanocrystals. It suggests that any additive influencing the colloidal stability of the nanocrystals can potentially alter the nucleation-rate behavior. The nucleation functions derived from experimental data enable predictions about the final nanoparticle sizes and size distributions. The nucleation parameters extracted from these functions correlate strongly with the outcomes of aggregative growth processes, demonstrating the potential for nucleation control in nanocrystal synthesis. The review also highlights the progress in observing aggregative growth and oriented attachment directly and the advancements in collecting and analyzing kinetic data for nanocrystal growth.
