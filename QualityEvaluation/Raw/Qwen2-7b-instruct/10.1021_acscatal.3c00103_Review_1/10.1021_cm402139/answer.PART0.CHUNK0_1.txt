[1] "The aggregative growth and oriented attachment of nanocrystals and nanoparticles are reviewed, and they are contrasted to classical LaMer nucleation and growth, and to Ostwald ripening."

[2] "The concept of a nucleation function is introduced, and approximated with a Gaussian form."

[3] "The nucleation function is defined by only three parameters: Γmax (height), Δtn (2σ width), and τn (peak-center time)."

[4] "Nucleation functions determined for the aggregative growth of gold, silver, and bismuth nanocrystals."

[5] "Nucleation functions enable clear predictions about the final mean nanoparticle sizes and size distributions."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty suggests that further research is needed to clarify the mechanism and determine the rate-controlling step. Understanding the mechanism better will improve our ability to optimize the PDH process for industrial applications.
