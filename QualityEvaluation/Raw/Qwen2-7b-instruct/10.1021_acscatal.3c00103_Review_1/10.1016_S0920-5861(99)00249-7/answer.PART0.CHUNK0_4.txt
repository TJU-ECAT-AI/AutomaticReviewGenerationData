[1] "The addition of tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption."
[2] "Similar effects of adding tin to supported platinum on the heats of ethylene adsorption have been observed in related investigations."
[3] "Spectroscopic investigations suggest that ethylene dissociatively adsorbs on platinum surfaces at room temperature to form ethylidyne species and adsorbed atomic hydrogen, but the addition of tin suppresses the formation of ethylidyne species such that molecularly-adsorbed ethylene is also present at room temperature on tin-modified platinum surfaces."
[4] "The higher heat for ethylene adsorption on Pt/SiO2 can be attributed to the decomposition of ethylene to an isobutylidyne species and surface hydrogen atoms."
[5] "The lower heat of adsorption on Pt/Sn/SiO2 may be attributed to molecularly adsorbed olefin."
[6] "Results from density functional theory calculations on Pt/Sn clusters suggest that besides geometric blocking effects, there is also an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[7] "The addition of tin to platinum reduces the effective size of surface platinum ensemble through either geometric and/or electronic effects and suppresses the formation of more-highly dehydrogenated surface species."

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is believed to be the rate-controlling step in PDH. However, there is ongoing debate about whether this step or the β-H extraction step is truly the rate-determining factor. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the interpretation of kinetic data and the development of accurate reaction mechanisms. The effectiveness of each step depends on the size and nature of the surface platinum ensembles, which are influenced by the presence of tin and potassium in the catalyst. The electron charge transfer from tin to platinum, as suggested by density functional theory calculations, contributes to the stabilization of smaller platinum ensembles, thereby suppressing the formation of more highly dehydrogenated surface species and enhancing the selectivity for PDH.

逆霍里蒂-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附步骤被认为是PDH过程中的决定性步骤。然而，关于这一步骤或β-H提取步骤是否真正是速率控制因素存在争议。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了动力学数据的解释和准确反应机制的发展。每个步骤的有效性取决于表面铂团簇的大小和性质，这受到催化剂中锡和钾的存在的影响。由密度泛函理论计算提出的电子电荷从锡转移到铂的效应有助于稳定较小的铂簇，从而抑制形成更高度脱氢的表面物种，并增强PDH的选择性。
