[1] "The addition of tin to silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of ethylene adsorption."
[2] "The higher initial heat for ethylene adsorption on platinum surfaces at room temperature may be attributed to the dissociation of ethylene to form ethylidyne species and adsorbed hydrogen."
[3] "The addition of tin suppresses the formation of ethylidyne and also weakens the interaction of molecularly-adsorbed ethylene with the catalyst."
[4] "The addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 decreases the initial heat of isobutene adsorption from 185 kJ/mol on Pt/SiO2 to 125 kJ/mol on Pt/Sn/SiO2."
[5] "The lower heat of adsorption on Pt/Sn/SiO2 may be attributed to molecularly adsorbed olefin."

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the molecule being broken into fragments on the surface. β-H extraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed molecule. Desorption is the final step where the fragment is released from the surface. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction pathway and potential catalyst design. If β-H extraction is rate-controlling, it suggests that the catalyst efficiently removes hydrogen from the adsorbed molecule, facilitating the subsequent desorption step. Conversely, if dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, it implies that the catalyst must effectively break the molecule apart before the reaction proceeds. This distinction guides the development of catalysts optimized for specific reaction stages.

反霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指分子在表面被分解成片段。β-H提取指的是从吸附的分子中移除一个氢原子。脱附是最后一步，将片段从表面释放出来。关于PDH反应中是否是解离吸附或β-H提取是决定性步骤的争论影响了我们对反应路径的理解以及催化剂设计的方向。如果β-H提取是决定性步骤，那么意味着催化剂能够有效地从吸附的分子中去除氢原子，从而促进后续的脱附步骤。相反，如果解离吸附是决定性步骤，那么意味着催化剂必须有效地将分子分解开来，才能使反应继续进行。这一区分指导着为特定反应阶段优化催化剂的设计。
