[1] "The results of our kinetics studies show that the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 suppresses the isomerization and hydrogenolysis of isobutane, and enhances the dehydrogenation selectivity."
[2] "Mssbauer spectroscopic results show that tin interacts with supported platinum to produce a Pt/Sn alloy."
[3] "Microcalorimetric results show that the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 inhibits ethylidyne formation from the adsorption of ethylene."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is crucial for initiating the reaction. However, the β-H extraction step is often considered the rate-controlling step due to its significant impact on the reaction's efficiency. The uncertainty regarding which step is rate-controlling influences our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the development of catalysts that can efficiently facilitate the reaction without being deactivated too quickly.

逆霍里蒂-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附步骤对于启动反应至关重要。然而，β-H提取步骤通常被认为是控制步骤，因为它对反应效率有显著影响。关于哪个步骤是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了开发可以高效促进反应而不会快速失活的催化剂的发展。
