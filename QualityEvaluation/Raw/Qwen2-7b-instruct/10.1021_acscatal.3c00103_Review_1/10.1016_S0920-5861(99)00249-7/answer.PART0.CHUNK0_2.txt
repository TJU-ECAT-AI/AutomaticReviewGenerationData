Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is crucial as it allows propane molecules to attach to the catalyst surface in an energetically favorable manner. Following this, β-H extraction facilitates the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule, creating an activated intermediate. Finally, the desorption step releases the product, propylene, from the catalyst surface. The debate over which step is rate-controlling often hinges on the specifics of the reaction conditions and the nature of the catalyst. Uncertainty in this area impacts our understanding of PDH by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and efficiency under various operational scenarios. To resolve this, researchers often employ a combination of experimental techniques, such as kinetic studies, microcalorimetry, and spectroscopic methods, to gain insights into the detailed mechanisms and identify the rate-determining step.

逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附步骤至关重要，因为它允许丙烷分子以能量最优的方式附着在催化剂表面上。随后，β-H提取步骤使从丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子成为可能，从而形成活化中间体。最后，脱附步骤将产品丙烯从催化剂表面释放出来。对于哪个步骤是决定性的，经常取决于具体反应条件和催化剂的性质。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH的理解，因为它使预测不同操作条件下的反应动力学和效率变得复杂。为了解决这个问题，研究人员通常结合使用实验技术，如动力学研究、微热容量法和光谱方法，来深入了解详细机制并确定决定性步骤。
