The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption is the first step where propane molecules detach from the surface. The β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, leading to the formation of propylene. Desorption is the final step, where the newly formed propylene molecule is released from the surface. 

The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction is crucial for understanding the PDH process. The uncertainty impacts our understanding of the reaction dynamics, particularly concerning the energy barriers and activation energies involved in each step. 

If the dissociative adsorption is the rate-controlling step, it suggests that the efficiency of the adsorption process determines the overall reaction rate. Conversely, if the β-H extraction is the rate-limiting step, it implies that the rate of hydrogen abstraction from the adsorbed propane molecule controls the reaction speed. Understanding which step is rate-controlling helps in optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

反向霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是第一步，丙烷分子从表面分离。随后进行β-H提取，从吸附的丙烷分子中抽取一个氢原子，形成丙烯。最后一步是脱附，新形成的丙烯分子从表面释放。

关于丙烷脱氢反应中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取过程是决定性步骤的争论，对于理解该反应至关重要。这种不确定性影响我们对反应动态的理解，特别是涉及到每一步的能量壁垒和活化能。

如果解离吸附是决定性步骤，那么吸附效率决定了整个反应速率。相反，如果β-H提取是决定性步骤，它意味着从吸附的丙烷分子中抽取氢原子的速度控制着反应速度。理解哪个步骤是决定性步骤有助于优化反应条件和催化剂设计，以实现高效的丙烷脱氢。
