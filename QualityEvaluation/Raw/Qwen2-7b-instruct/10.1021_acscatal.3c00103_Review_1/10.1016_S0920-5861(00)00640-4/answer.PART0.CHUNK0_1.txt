[1] "The kinetic rate expression for the time-dependent coke formation rate during propane dehydrogenation over a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst has been experimentally determined."
[2] "For relatively short times on stream, especially at low temperatures and low propylene concentrations, a remarkable initial quadratic increase has been observed in the coke formation rates versus time with a high apparent propylene reaction order."
[3] "After longer times on stream the coke formation rate decreases to a constant residual coke growth above approximately 12 wt.% coke content."
[4] "The model satisfactorily describes the remarkable initial quadratic increase in the coke formation rates versus time (auto-catalysis) with its high apparent propylene reaction order, and the decrease in coke formation rates after longer times on stream (auto-deactivation), with a constant residual coke formation rate when the coke content exceeds 12 wt.%. Also the observed very pronounced influence of the hydrogen concentration is quantitatively captured by the model."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty complicates the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of reaction conditions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于吸附过程或β-H提取是否是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性使预测反应动力学和优化反应条件变得复杂。
