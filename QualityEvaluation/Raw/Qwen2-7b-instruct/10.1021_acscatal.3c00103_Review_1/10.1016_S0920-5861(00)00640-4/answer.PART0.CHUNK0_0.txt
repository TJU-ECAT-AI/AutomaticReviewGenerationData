<p>A novel multifunctional reactor is developed for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Using a fixed monolithic catalyst as an energy repository, an indirect coupling is achieved between energy necessary for the endothermic propane dehydrogenation and energy released by the combustion with air of the formed coke and added hydrocarbons for overall energy balance.</p>
<p>The aim of this work is to derive a kinetic rate expression to describe quantitatively the total amount of coke deposits in time on a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst under propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Firstly, it has been confirmed that coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation originate almost solely from propylene (see Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, comparable coke formation rates are obtained for pure propylene on monolith samples with and without platinum dispersed in the washcoat, suggesting that most of the carbonaceous products is formed on acid sites of the γ-Al2O3 washcoat.</p>
<p>A kinetic rate expression is developed based on a, as simple as possible, mechanistic model but able to quantitatively describe the above-mentioned experimental observations. The basic assumptions are as follows:</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact nature of the rate-controlling step between dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction remains a subject of debate in the scientific community. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction.

The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of PDH in several ways. First, it influences the selection of catalyst materials and conditions that optimize the reaction rate. If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalysts with high surface area and effective adsorption properties might be preferred. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, catalysts that efficiently facilitate hydrogen abstraction could be advantageous. 

Second, the mechanism of action determines the pathways for product formation and side reactions, affecting the selectivity and purity of the output. For instance, if β-H extraction is favored, the likelihood of unwanted side reactions such as hydrogenation increases, impacting product quality.

Lastly, the kinetic rate expression derived in this study provides valuable insights into the PDH process. The expression accurately describes the remarkable initial quadratic increase in the coke formation rates versus time, known as auto-catalysis, and captures the decrease in coke formation rates after longer times on stream, indicating auto-deactivation. The model also quantitatively accounts for the pronounced influence of the hydrogen concentration, enhancing our ability to predict and control PDH reactions effectively.

反Horiuti-Polanyi机制的丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于吸附过程和β-H提取之间的速率控制步骤之间存在争议，这在科学界是一个争论点。这种不确定性使我们对PDH过程的理解复杂化，因为它影响反应速率。

关于速率控制步骤的不确定性影响PDH理解的几个方面。首先，它决定了选择优化反应速率的催化剂材料和条件。如果离解吸附是速率控制步骤，那么具有高比表面积和有效吸附性能的催化剂可能更受欢迎。相反，如果β-H提取是速率控制步骤，那么能够有效促进氢化物提取的催化剂可能是有利的。

其次，机制决定了产物形成和副反应的途径，从而影响输出的纯度和质量。例如，如果β-H提取占优势，那么发生不希望的副反应如氢化的机会增加，这会影响产品质量。

最后，导出的热力学速率表达式为PDH过程提供了有价值的见解。该表达式准确描述了令人瞩目的初始二次增长的焦炭生成速率与时间的关系，即自催化现象，并捕捉了长时间后焦炭生成速率的下降，表明自我失活。该模型还量化地考虑了氢浓度的影响，增强了我们预测和控制PDH反应的能力。
