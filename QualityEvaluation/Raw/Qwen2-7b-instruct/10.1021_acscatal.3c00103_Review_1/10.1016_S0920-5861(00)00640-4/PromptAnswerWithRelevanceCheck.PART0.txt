<p>A novel multifunctional reactor is developed for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Using a fixed monolithic catalyst as an energy repository, an indirect coupling is achieved between energy necessary for the endothermic propane dehydrogenation and energy released by the combustion with air of the formed coke and added hydrocarbons for overall energy balance.</p>
<p>The aim of this work is to derive a kinetic rate expression to describe quantitatively the total amount of coke deposits in time on a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst under propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Firstly, it has been confirmed that coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation originate almost solely from propylene (see Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, comparable coke formation rates are obtained for pure propylene on monolith samples with and without platinum dispersed in the washcoat, suggesting that most of the carbonaceous products is formed on acid sites of the γ-Al2O3 washcoat.</p>
<p>A kinetic rate expression is developed based on a, as simple as possible, mechanistic model but able to quantitatively describe the above-mentioned experimental observations. The basic assumptions are as follows:</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact nature of the rate-controlling step between dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction remains a subject of debate in the scientific community. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction.

The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of PDH in several ways. First, it influences the selection of catalyst materials and conditions that optimize the reaction rate. If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalysts with high surface area and effective adsorption properties might be preferred. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, catalysts that efficiently facilitate hydrogen abstraction could be advantageous. 

Second, the mechanism of action determines the pathways for product formation and side reactions, affecting the selectivity and purity of the output. For instance, if β-H extraction is favored, the likelihood of unwanted side reactions such as hydrogenation increases, impacting product quality.

Lastly, the kinetic rate expression derived in this study provides valuable insights into the PDH process. The expression accurately describes the remarkable initial quadratic increase in the coke formation rates versus time, known as auto-catalysis, and captures the decrease in coke formation rates after longer times on stream, indicating auto-deactivation. The model also quantitatively accounts for the pronounced influence of the hydrogen concentration, enhancing our ability to predict and control PDH reactions effectively.

反Horiuti-Polanyi机制的丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于吸附过程和β-H提取之间的速率控制步骤之间存在争议，这在科学界是一个争论点。这种不确定性使我们对PDH过程的理解复杂化，因为它影响反应速率。

关于速率控制步骤的不确定性影响PDH理解的几个方面。首先，它决定了选择优化反应速率的催化剂材料和条件。如果离解吸附是速率控制步骤，那么具有高比表面积和有效吸附性能的催化剂可能更受欢迎。相反，如果β-H提取是速率控制步骤，那么能够有效促进氢化物提取的催化剂可能是有利的。

其次，机制决定了产物形成和副反应的途径，从而影响输出的纯度和质量。例如，如果β-H提取占优势，那么发生不希望的副反应如氢化的机会增加，这会影响产品质量。

最后，导出的热力学速率表达式为PDH过程提供了有价值的见解。该表达式准确描述了令人瞩目的初始二次增长的焦炭生成速率与时间的关系，即自催化现象，并捕捉了长时间后焦炭生成速率的下降，表明自我失活。该模型还量化地考虑了氢浓度的影响，增强了我们预测和控制PDH反应的能力。

[1] "The kinetic rate expression for the time-dependent coke formation rate during propane dehydrogenation over a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst has been experimentally determined."
[2] "For relatively short times on stream, especially at low temperatures and low propylene concentrations, a remarkable initial quadratic increase has been observed in the coke formation rates versus time with a high apparent propylene reaction order."
[3] "After longer times on stream the coke formation rate decreases to a constant residual coke growth above approximately 12 wt.% coke content."
[4] "The model satisfactorily describes the remarkable initial quadratic increase in the coke formation rates versus time (auto-catalysis) with its high apparent propylene reaction order, and the decrease in coke formation rates after longer times on stream (auto-deactivation), with a constant residual coke formation rate when the coke content exceeds 12 wt.%. Also the observed very pronounced influence of the hydrogen concentration is quantitatively captured by the model."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate in the scientific community centers around whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty significantly impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as the rate-controlling step determines the overall efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. The mechanism proposed in the document suggests that the rate-determining step is the formation of a coke precursor (CP) through the oligomerization of adsorbed propylene. This process leads to the formation of hexene or further dehydrogenated/aromatized products, which then react to form monolayer coke. The model also assumes that CP grows instantly to monolayer coke with adsorbed propylene molecules, indicating a fast conversion process. The derived kinetic rate expression, based on this mechanistic model, quantitatively describes the coke formation rates over a wide temperature and concentration range. The model satisfactorily captures the initial quadratic increase in the coke formation rates versus time, reflecting the auto-catalytic behavior, and the decrease in coke formation rates after longer times on stream, indicating auto-deactivation. The model also accounts for the pronounced influence of the hydrogen concentration on the coking rates, providing valuable insights into the PDH process.

反Horiiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。科学界围绕PDH反应中是否为解离吸附过程或β-H提取作为速率控制步骤的持续争议，显著影响我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性直接影响了我们对PDH过程的整体效率和动力学的认识。提出的机制表明，决定性步骤是通过丙烯的寡聚化形成焦炭前体（CP）。这个过程导致形成己烯或其他进一步脱氢或芳香化的产物，然后与吸附的丙烯反应形成单层焦炭。模型假设CP立即与吸附的丙烯分子形成单层焦炭，暗示了一个快速转化过程。基于这个机理模型得出的动力学率表达式，可以定量描述在宽温度和浓度范围内的焦炭沉积速率。该模型很好地捕捉了焦炭沉积率随时间的二次增加现象，反映了自催化行为，并在更长时间上流后焦炭沉积速率的降低，显示了自失活特性。该模型还考虑到氢浓度对沉积率的影响，提供了PDH过程的宝贵见解。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is not directly addressed in the literature provided. However, the document discusses a mechanistic dual coke growth model that assumes the formation of coke precursors via propylene oligomerization. This process explains the observed auto-catalysis for short times on stream during the PDH reaction. The model successfully describes the coke formation rates, providing valuable information for the design and optimization of propane dehydrogenation reactors. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction mechanism. The uncertainty in this aspect affects the interpretation of reaction kinetics and the prediction of reaction outcomes. The model, based on the assumption of propylene oligomerization, offers insights into the PDH process but does not directly resolve the debate about the rate-controlling step.

提供的文献中没有直接讨论逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制（PDH）的细节。然而，文献中提到一个基于双焦炭生长模型的机理描述了焦炭形成速率的时间依赖性。该模型假设焦炭前体通过丙烷聚合物化过程形成，解释了短时间反应流中的自催化现象。该模型成功地描述了焦炭形成速率，并为丙烷脱氢反应器的设计和优化提供了有价值的信息。关于PDH反应中吸附过程或β-H提取是决定性步骤的争论影响了我们对反应机制的理解。这种不确定性影响了反应动力学的解释和反应结果的预测。基于丙烷聚合物化假设的模型为理解PDH过程提供了见解，但并未直接解决决定性步骤的争论。
