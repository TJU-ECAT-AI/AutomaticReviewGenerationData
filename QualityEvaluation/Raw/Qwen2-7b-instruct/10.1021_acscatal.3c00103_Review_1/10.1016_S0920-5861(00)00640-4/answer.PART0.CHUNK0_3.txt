The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate in the scientific community centers around whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty significantly impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as the rate-controlling step determines the overall efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. The mechanism proposed in the document suggests that the rate-determining step is the formation of a coke precursor (CP) through the oligomerization of adsorbed propylene. This process leads to the formation of hexene or further dehydrogenated/aromatized products, which then react to form monolayer coke. The model also assumes that CP grows instantly to monolayer coke with adsorbed propylene molecules, indicating a fast conversion process. The derived kinetic rate expression, based on this mechanistic model, quantitatively describes the coke formation rates over a wide temperature and concentration range. The model satisfactorily captures the initial quadratic increase in the coke formation rates versus time, reflecting the auto-catalytic behavior, and the decrease in coke formation rates after longer times on stream, indicating auto-deactivation. The model also accounts for the pronounced influence of the hydrogen concentration on the coking rates, providing valuable insights into the PDH process.

反Horiiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。科学界围绕PDH反应中是否为解离吸附过程或β-H提取作为速率控制步骤的持续争议，显著影响我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性直接影响了我们对PDH过程的整体效率和动力学的认识。提出的机制表明，决定性步骤是通过丙烯的寡聚化形成焦炭前体（CP）。这个过程导致形成己烯或其他进一步脱氢或芳香化的产物，然后与吸附的丙烯反应形成单层焦炭。模型假设CP立即与吸附的丙烯分子形成单层焦炭，暗示了一个快速转化过程。基于这个机理模型得出的动力学率表达式，可以定量描述在宽温度和浓度范围内的焦炭沉积速率。该模型很好地捕捉了焦炭沉积率随时间的二次增加现象，反映了自催化行为，并在更长时间上流后焦炭沉积速率的降低，显示了自失活特性。该模型还考虑到氢浓度对沉积率的影响，提供了PDH过程的宝贵见解。
