[1] "The kinetic rate expression for the time-dependent coke formation rate during propane dehydrogenation over a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst has been successfully described by a kinetic rate expression based on a mechanistic dual coke growth model."
[2] "In this model it has been assumed that initially coke precursor is formed via a propylene oligomerisation process, explaining the observed auto-catalysis for short times on stream."
[3] "The derived kinetic rate expression provides valuable information for the design and optimisation of propane dehydrogenation reactors."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is not directly addressed in the literature provided. However, the document discusses a mechanistic dual coke growth model that assumes the formation of coke precursors via propylene oligomerization. This process explains the observed auto-catalysis for short times on stream during the PDH reaction. The model successfully describes the coke formation rates, providing valuable information for the design and optimization of propane dehydrogenation reactors. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction mechanism. The uncertainty in this aspect affects the interpretation of reaction kinetics and the prediction of reaction outcomes. The model, based on the assumption of propylene oligomerization, offers insights into the PDH process but does not directly resolve the debate about the rate-controlling step.

提供的文献中没有直接讨论逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制（PDH）的细节。然而，文献中提到一个基于双焦炭生长模型的机理描述了焦炭形成速率的时间依赖性。该模型假设焦炭前体通过丙烷聚合物化过程形成，解释了短时间反应流中的自催化现象。该模型成功地描述了焦炭形成速率，并为丙烷脱氢反应器的设计和优化提供了有价值的信息。关于PDH反应中吸附过程或β-H提取是决定性步骤的争论影响了我们对反应机制的理解。这种不确定性影响了反应动力学的解释和反应结果的预测。基于丙烷聚合物化假设的模型为理解PDH过程提供了见解，但并未直接解决决定性步骤的争论。
