The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty has significant implications for the optimization and understanding of the PDH process, influencing how we approach reactor design and operational parameters to enhance efficiency and productivity.
