[1] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol)."
[2] "Further investigations showed that some catalysts were able to activate carbon dioxide, so these catalysts could be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "Moreover, insufficient oxidizing property of carbon dioxide allows to exclude possibility of the redox-cycle mechanism over VMgOx catalyst."
[4] "The KRICTDECSO process was implemented at a pilot-scale plant in Korea, operating at Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd. (SGC), with the styrene production capacity of 100 tons per day."
[5] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[6] "According to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, which is commonly used for description of olefin production processes by oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, carbon dioxide should be able to reoxidize the catalyst surface reduced by hydrocarbons."
[7] "The aim of study is analysis of the most probable pathways of the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with carbon dioxide over vanadium-magnesium oxide catalyst."
[8] "At the temperature higher by 100, where carbon dioxide was activated and consumed at 873 K over VMgOx catalyst (conversion of CO2 decreased from 12 to 4 with its increasing partial pressure)."
[9] "These results suggest that carbon dioxide was not activated at the temperature of 773 K."
[10] "The highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in the isobutane dehydrogenation process was around 800-826 K."
[11] "This activation changes the overall reaction mechanism."
[12] "The same situation can be observed in the absence of the catalyst, where the simple dehydrogenation reaction (2) is the main path to isobutene formation."
[13] "Above 826 K conversion of CO2 over VMgOx catalyst in both the dehydrogenation of isobutane and RWGS reaction becomes measurable."
[14] "Thus, it seems to be reasonable to assume that carbon dioxide removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene as predicted by the thermodynamic calculations done for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process."
[15] "Acidbase properties of the catalyst seem to be more important for the reaction route than the redox ones."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding the rate-controlling step in this reaction focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the limiting factor. The uncertainty about this step impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the efficiency of the reaction and the overall yield of the desired product. The influence of acidbase properties of the catalyst on the reaction route appears to be more significant than the redox mechanism in the case of PDH over vanadium-magnesium oxide catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制包含三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于PDH反应速率控制步骤的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取是否为限制因素。对这一步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和目标产物的整体产率。催化剂的酸碱性质对反应路径的影响似乎比还原氧化机制在使用钒镁氧化物催化剂的PDH过程中更为重要。
