[1] "Conversion of carbon dioxide to CO and O2 at 2273 K is less than 2%, due to low value of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH at 298 K is 293 kJ/mol) [1] ,[2] ."
[2] "In the early nineties, however, it was found that addition of small amounts of CO2 (below 0.5%) to ethylbenzene feed in the presence of a commercial dehydrogenation catalyst decreased the catalyst deactivation by coke formation [3] ,[4] , and it allowed reducing the cost of styrene production by saving energy [3] ."
[3] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts [21] confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[4] "Moreover, insufficient oxidizing property of carbon dioxide allows to exclude possibility of the redox-cycle mechanism over VMgOx catalyst."
[5] "As it has been shown, the ability of carbon dioxide to regenerate VMgOx catalyst was insufficient, because heating of the used-up catalyst in pure CO2 flow did not recover its initial activity (grey areas in Fig. 4 )."
[6] "Nevertheless, the majority of researchers still consider the redox cycle as a prevailing mechanism for dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 over various transition metal oxide catalysts [4] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, there is ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences how the reaction proceeds and the efficiency of the conversion. The document does not provide specific insights into the mechanism's steps or the debate surrounding the rate-controlling step.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个步骤：解吸附吸附，β-H提取和脱附。然而，在这个反应中，关于是解吸附吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的进行方式以及转换的效率。文档没有提供有关机制步骤或争论的特定见解。
