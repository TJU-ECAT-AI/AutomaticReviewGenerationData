[1] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[2] "Moreover, insufficient oxidizing property of carbon dioxide allows to exclude possibility of the redox-cycle mechanism over VMgOx catalyst."

The role of carbon dioxide in the conversion of isobutane to isobutene over VMgOx catalyst was studied based on catalytic tests and kinetic investigations. It was shown that both the high temperature and the presence of VMgOx catalyst are required for the activation of the CO2 molecule. The activation changes the overall reaction mechanism. At lower temperatures, carbon dioxide behaves as an inert gas, merely decreasing the hydrocarbon partial pressure. Above 826 K, conversion of CO2 over VMgOx catalyst in both the dehydrogenation of isobutane and RWGS reaction becomes measurable. The presence of CO2 removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene, as predicted by thermodynamic calculations for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process.

基于催化测试和动力学研究，二氧化碳在VMgOx催化剂下将异丁烷转化为异丁烯的过程进行了研究。结果显示，高温和VMgOx催化剂的存在对于激活二氧化碳分子是必要的。激活会改变整个反应机制。在较低温度下，二氧化碳表现为惰性气体，仅降低烃类分压。在826 K以上，VMgOx催化剂上的二氧化碳在异丁烷脱氢和水煤气变换反应中可测量地转化。二氧化碳去除反应混合物中的氢，并增强异丁烷转化为异丁烯，这与脱氢过程的两步途径的热力学计算预测相符。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact sequence of these steps, particularly whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, remains a subject of debate among researchers. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. The role of acid-base properties of the catalyst is emphasized as being crucial for the reaction route, rather than the redox mechanism, influencing the overall process.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism proposes that propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface in a dissociated form, allowing for the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H) from the propane molecule, followed by the desorption of the resulting propylene molecule. However, the ongoing debate centers on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty surrounding this issue impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the importance of surface chemistry and the role of the catalyst in controlling reaction kinetics. It suggests that the efficiency of the β-H extraction might be influenced by the adsorption configuration and the strength of the interactions between the reactants and the catalyst surface. This complexity in determining the rate-controlling step underscores the intricate nature of heterogeneous catalysis and the need for further research to elucidate the detailed mechanisms governing PDH.

In the context of the literature provided, the discussion on the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of isobutane over vanadium-magnesium oxide (VMgOx) catalysts highlights the importance of both the catalyst and high temperature for the activation of CO2. It suggests that below 800-826 K, CO2 behaves as an inert gas, merely decreasing the hydrocarbon partial pressure. Above this temperature, CO2 becomes activated and consumes, enhancing alkane conversion. The presence of CO2 modifies the reaction mechanism, allowing for the removal of hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhancing isobutane conversion to isobutene. Acid-base properties of the catalyst seem to play a crucial role in this process, influencing the reaction pathway and selectivity.

The results also indicate that the redox mechanism, although possible, is less favored due to the insufficient oxidizing power of CO2. The literature further discusses the regeneration of the catalyst by CO2, revealing that while CO2 alone may not be sufficient for complete catalyst regeneration, a small volume of air is capable of reoxidizing the catalyst surface. This finding supports the conclusion that the redox cycle is not the prevailing mechanism in this system, emphasizing the importance of acid-base interactions in facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个连续步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制提出，丙烷分子在催化剂表面以解离形式吸附，允许从丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子（β-H），随后将形成的丙烯分子脱附。然而，关于β-H提取过程是否为控制反应速率的关键步骤的争议仍在继续。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，表明表面化学和催化剂在控制反应动力学中的重要性。它表明β-H提取的效率可能受到反应物与催化剂表面之间吸附配置和相互作用强度的影响。这种确定关键步骤的复杂性凸显了异相催化作用的复杂性和进一步研究阐明PDH详细机制的需求。

根据提供的文献，关于二氧化碳在范德镁氧化物（VMgOx）催化剂上异丁烷脱氢的作用讨论强调了催化剂和高温对于二氧化碳激活的重要性。在低于800-826 K的温度下，二氧化碳表现为惰性气体，仅降低烃类的分压。在高于这个温度时，二氧化碳被激活并消耗，增强烷烃的转化。二氧化碳的存在改变了反应机制，允许从反应混合物中移除氢，并增强异丁烷转化为异丁烯的转化率。催化剂的酸碱性质似乎在这一过程中起着关键作用，影响反应途径和选择性。

结果还表明，尽管氧化还原机制是可能的，但由于二氧化碳的氧化能力不足，它不是首选机制。文献进一步讨论了通过二氧化碳再生催化剂的情况，揭示了虽然二氧化碳自身可能不足以完全再生催化剂，但少量空气足以重新氧化催化剂表面。这一发现支持了结论，即氧化还原循环不是此系统中占主导地位的机制，强调了酸碱相互作用在促进脱氢过程中的重要性。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, the literature does not directly address the ongoing debate regarding which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step in PDH. The uncertainty about this point impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the primary reaction pathway and the factors influencing its kinetics.

5. "On the other hand, at the temperatures higher than 826 K, the apparent activation energy of the reaction in the presence of carbon dioxide is lower than that under helium atmosphere (71 and 84 kJ/mol, respectively). Therefore, the presence of carbon dioxide clearly promotes conversion of isobutane over VMgOx catalyst."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism was initially proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi, who suggested that the β-H atom is extracted from the propane molecule during the dehydrogenation process. However, there is ongoing debate in the scientific community about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty surrounding this debate impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects how the reaction is modeled and optimized in industrial applications. The presence of a catalyst and the temperature play crucial roles in determining the reaction pathway. At lower temperatures, the mechanism proceeds through simple dehydrogenation, while at higher temperatures, the presence of carbon dioxide leads to a reduction in the apparent activation energy, suggesting that the reaction is promoted by the presence of the catalyst and carbon dioxide.
