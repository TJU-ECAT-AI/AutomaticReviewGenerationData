[1] "Our recent experiments over VMgOx catalysts confirmed that reoxidation of the species deeply reduced by hydrogen with pure CO2 at 873 K was very hard and could not restore initial, high oxidation state of vanadium cations."
[2] "Moreover, insufficient oxidizing property of carbon dioxide allows to exclude possibility of the redox-cycle mechanism over VMgOx catalyst."

The role of carbon dioxide in the conversion of isobutane to isobutene over VMgOx catalyst was studied based on catalytic tests and kinetic investigations. It was shown that both the high temperature and the presence of VMgOx catalyst are required for the activation of the CO2 molecule. The activation changes the overall reaction mechanism. At lower temperatures, carbon dioxide behaves as an inert gas, merely decreasing the hydrocarbon partial pressure. Above 826 K, conversion of CO2 over VMgOx catalyst in both the dehydrogenation of isobutane and RWGS reaction becomes measurable. The presence of CO2 removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and enhances isobutane conversion to isobutene, as predicted by thermodynamic calculations for the two-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process.

基于催化测试和动力学研究，二氧化碳在VMgOx催化剂下将异丁烷转化为异丁烯的过程进行了研究。结果显示，高温和VMgOx催化剂的存在对于激活二氧化碳分子是必要的。激活会改变整个反应机制。在较低温度下，二氧化碳表现为惰性气体，仅降低烃类分压。在826 K以上，VMgOx催化剂上的二氧化碳在异丁烷脱氢和水煤气变换反应中可测量地转化。二氧化碳去除反应混合物中的氢，并增强异丁烷转化为异丁烯，这与脱氢过程的两步途径的热力学计算预测相符。
