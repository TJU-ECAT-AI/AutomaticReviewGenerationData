1. "Thus, it can be concluded that both the catalyst and the high temperature are required for the carbon dioxide activation."
2. "At the temperatures below 760 K, the apparent activation energy is 49 kJ/mol both in the presence and the absence of CO2."
3. "At higher temperatures, carbon dioxide is consumed and takes part in the dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall alkane conversion."
4. "The beneficial effect of CO2 can be related to its gasification properties."
5. "Nevertheless, as it was shown in [26], the amount of coke generated during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was always higher than that in helium."
6. "The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at 873 K combined with periodical heating of the catalyst bed under carbon dioxide and oxygen flow at the same temperature was employed for examining the ability of CO2 to regenerate the catalyst."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact rate-controlling step in this process remains uncertain, leading to ongoing debate among researchers. This uncertainty affects our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The literature does not provide a clear consensus on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-determining step.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horwitz-Polanyi机制包含三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。此过程的速率控制步骤的确切确定存在争议，导致研究者之间存在持续的讨论。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。文献没有提供关于离解吸附或β-H提取是决定性步骤的明确共识。
