<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is a current debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-determining step, which influences our comprehension of the PDH process.
