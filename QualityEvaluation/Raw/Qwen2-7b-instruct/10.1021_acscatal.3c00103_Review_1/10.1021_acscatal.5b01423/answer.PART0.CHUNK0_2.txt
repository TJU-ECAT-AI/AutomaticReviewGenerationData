[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process."
[3] "This uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step has significant implications for the optimization of catalysts and the understanding of the PDH mechanism."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The scientific community debates whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process and the optimization of catalysts.
