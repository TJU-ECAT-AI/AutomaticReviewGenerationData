The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Traditionally, the dissociative adsorption step was thought to be the rate-controlling step. However, recent studies propose that the β-H extraction might actually play a more critical role in the reaction process. This ongoing debate about which step is rate-determining affects our understanding of the PDH process, specifically regarding reaction kinetics and efficiency.
