[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step has led to a lively debate within the scientific community."
[3] "This debate impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as the rate-controlling step determines the overall efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate in the scientific community questions whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step, which significantly influences our understanding of the PDH process's efficiency and selectivity.
