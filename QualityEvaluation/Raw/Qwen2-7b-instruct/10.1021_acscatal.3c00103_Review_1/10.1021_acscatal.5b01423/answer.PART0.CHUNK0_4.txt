The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Traditionally, the dissociative adsorption step was thought to be the rate-controlling step. However, recent studies propose that the β-H extraction might actually play a more critical role in the reaction process. This ongoing debate about which step is rate-determining affects our understanding of the PDH process, specifically regarding reaction kinetics and efficiency.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关键步骤，包括三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。传统观点认为，解吸附吸附步骤是控制速率的步骤。然而，最近的研究表明，β-H提取可能在反应过程中扮演更为关键的角色。关于哪一步是决定性步骤的争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，特别是关于反应速率和效率的理解。
