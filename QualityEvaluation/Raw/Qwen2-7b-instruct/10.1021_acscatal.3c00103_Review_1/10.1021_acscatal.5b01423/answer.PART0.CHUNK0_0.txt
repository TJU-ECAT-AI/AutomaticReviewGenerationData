[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "The debate over which step is the rate-controlling one continues, with arguments supporting both the dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction processes."
[3] "This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process and the factors influencing its efficiency."

1. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling factor in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process and its efficiency.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里图-波兰尼机制包含三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪一步是控制速率的因素，存在争论，分别支持离解吸附过程和β-H提取过程。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程及其效率的理解。
