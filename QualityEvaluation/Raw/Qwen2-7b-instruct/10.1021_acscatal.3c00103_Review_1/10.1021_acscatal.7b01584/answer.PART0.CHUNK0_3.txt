1. Hydrogen plays a positive role in the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt(111). The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption.
2. In the PDH process, the rate-controlling step is currently uncertain, with debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the more significant factor.
3. This uncertainty affects our understanding of the PDH process, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic reaction.

1. 氢在丙烷在Pt(111)上的脱氢反应中起着积极的作用。逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。
2. 在PDH过程中，速率控制步骤目前存在不确定性，争论焦点在于解离吸附或β-H提取哪个更为关键。
3. 这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，影响催化反应的效率和选择性。
