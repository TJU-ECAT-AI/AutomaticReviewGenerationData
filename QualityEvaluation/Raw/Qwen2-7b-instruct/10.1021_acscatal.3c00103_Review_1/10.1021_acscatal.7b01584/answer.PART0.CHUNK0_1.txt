The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate about which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty affects our comprehension of the PDH process.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制在丙烷脱氢中起着积极作用，涉及三个主要步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于这三种步骤中的哪一步——解吸附吸附或β-H提取——是速率控制步骤的问题存在争议。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。
