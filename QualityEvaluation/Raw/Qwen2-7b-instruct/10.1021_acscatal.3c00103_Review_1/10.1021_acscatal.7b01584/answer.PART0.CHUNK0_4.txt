The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the dissociative adsorption step, propane molecules are split into fragments, which then undergo β-H extraction, followed by desorption where the resulting products are released from the surface. The current debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying the rate-limiting step among these three processes, either dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction. This uncertainty influences our comprehension of the PDH process by emphasizing the intricate nature of surface chemistry involved.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的关键，包括三个基本步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在离解吸附步骤中，丙烷分子被分解成碎片，然后进行β-H提取，最后是脱附，产物从表面释放。科学界当前的争议在于确定这三个过程中的哪一步是速率限制步骤，是离解吸附还是β-H提取。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，突出了涉及表面化学的复杂性。
