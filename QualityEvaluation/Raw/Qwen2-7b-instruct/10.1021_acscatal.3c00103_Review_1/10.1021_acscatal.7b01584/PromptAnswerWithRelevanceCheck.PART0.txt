The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH on Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption is often regarded as the rate-controlling step. Yet, there is an ongoing debate over whether β-H extraction plays this crucial role instead. This disagreement has implications for our comprehension of the PDH process.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the dissociative adsorption step, propane molecules are split into fragments, which then undergo β-H extraction, followed by desorption where the resulting products are released from the surface. The current debate in the scientific community revolves around identifying the rate-limiting step among these three processes, either dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction. This uncertainty influences our comprehension of the PDH process by emphasizing the intricate nature of surface chemistry involved.
