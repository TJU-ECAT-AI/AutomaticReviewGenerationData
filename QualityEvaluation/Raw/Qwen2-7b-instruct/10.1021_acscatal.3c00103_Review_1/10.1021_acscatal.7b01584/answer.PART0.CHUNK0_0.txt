The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH on Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption is often regarded as the rate-controlling step. Yet, there is an ongoing debate over whether β-H extraction plays this crucial role instead. This disagreement has implications for our comprehension of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢涉及三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在Pt(111)上进行丙烷脱氢时，离解吸附通常被视为控制步骤。然而，关于β-H提取是否是控制步骤存在争议。这种分歧影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。
