1. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate focuses on determining which of these steps controls the reaction rate, with both processes playing crucial roles in the PDH process. This uncertainty complicates the understanding of the PDH mechanism, emphasizing the intricate nature of surface chemistry involved in the reaction.
