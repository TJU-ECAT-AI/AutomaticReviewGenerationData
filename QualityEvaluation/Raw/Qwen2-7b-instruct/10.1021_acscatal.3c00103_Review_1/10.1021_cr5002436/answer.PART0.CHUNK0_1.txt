[1] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar."
[2] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[3] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[4] "A schematic representation of a Catofin dehydrogenation unit is shown in Figure 3."
[5] "A simplified version of the gas separation unit used to separate the olefins from paraffins, cracking products, and residual hydrogen is shown."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a theoretical model that describes the process in three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over which step is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The dissociative adsorption step involves the breaking of the propane molecule into propane radicals on the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane radical, and the desorption step is the release of the resulting propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step affects our ability to optimize the PDH process and understand the reaction mechanisms involved.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a theoretical framework that helps us understand the propane dehydrogenation process. It includes three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is the initial process where propane molecules break down into propane radicals upon contact with the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane radical, while the desorption step is the release of the resulting propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate about which of these steps is the rate-limiting step has significant implications for the optimization of the PDH process and the understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms.
