[1] "For this catalytic system, this represented a great limitation, as the reaction mixtures are believed to reduce chromium oxide species."
[2] "Indeed, both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum."
[3] "This has been attributed to the fact that during this induction period, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states."
[4] "The latter is particularly important, given that the sintering of chromia under dehydrogenation conditions has also been reported to be a contributing factor to the reversible deactivation of chromium-based catalysts."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding which step is rate-controlling remains unresolved, impacting our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty stems from the interplay between the energy barriers associated with these steps and the catalytic sites' accessibility. This ambiguity influences the design and optimization of dehydrogenation catalysts, as it affects the efficiency of the reaction pathway and the catalyst's lifetime. The dissociative adsorption process, where propane molecules attach to the catalyst surface and break apart, could be rate-limiting if it requires significant activation energy. Alternatively, the β-H extraction, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, might control the reaction if it is energetically demanding. The desorption step, where the resulting propylene is released, might not be the bottleneck unless it involves complex interactions with the catalyst surface. The exact role of each step depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions, making it challenging to pinpoint the rate-determining step definitively. This uncertainty guides further research into understanding the detailed mechanisms and optimizing the PDH process.

逆Horwuti-Polanyi机制涉及丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪个步骤是控制步骤的争论仍然存在，这影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性源于与这些步骤相关能量壁垒的相互作用以及催化位点的可接近性。这指导了反应路径效率和催化剂寿命的设计和优化。如果解离吸附过程需要显著激活能，那么它可能是速率限制步骤。相反，如果从吸附的丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子要求高能，那么β-H提取可能是控制反应的步骤。释放步骤，即生成的丙烯从催化剂表面释放，可能不是瓶颈，除非涉及到复杂的催化剂表面交互作用。每个步骤的确切作用取决于特定的催化剂和反应条件，因此很难明确指出决定性速率步骤。这种不确定性引导了进一步研究以理解详细机制并优化PDH过程。
