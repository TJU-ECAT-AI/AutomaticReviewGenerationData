[1] "The CH bonds in paraffins and olefins are considerably more reactive than CC bonds, meaning that catalysts that favor CH over CC bond cleavage are required to avoid side reactions."
[2] "As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions."
[3] "Indeed, it was found that step sites are more reactive, as the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) than on the flat surface (6372 kJ mol1)."
[4] "The balance between dehydrogenation and these side reactions is very complex."
[5] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[7] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."
[8] "Indeed, some studies correlating dehydrogenation activity with Cr-speciation suggested that a vast majority of catalytic activity can be ascribed to the dispersed Cr3+ phase, the role of the other phases being the replenishment of the depleted Cr3+ surface phase during long runs."
[9] "This has been attributed to the fact that during this induction period, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states."
[10] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[11] "Indeed, the use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[12] "For example, when a small amount of La2O3 is added to Al2O3, the transition of θ-alumina to α-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added."
[13] "Indeed, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism begins with the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface in a dissociative manner. Next, a β-H atom is abstracted from the propane molecule, creating a propylidyne intermediate. Finally, the propylene product is desorbed from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the literature revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption step or the β-H extraction step is the rate-limiting step in the reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the need for further investigation into the specific conditions that affect each step. The precise identification of the rate-determining step can guide the optimization of catalyst design and operating conditions for maximizing propylene yield and selectivity.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。机制开始时，丙烷分子以解离方式吸附到催化剂表面。接着，从丙烷分子中提取一个β-H原子，形成丙基二烯中间体。最后，丙烯产物从催化剂表面脱附。关于该反应机制中的限制步骤，文献中存在争议，争议焦点在于解离吸附步骤或β-H提取步骤是否为决定速率的关键步骤。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它揭示了反应机制的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步研究每一步的具体条件。准确识别决定速率的关键步骤可以指导催化剂设计和操作条件的优化，以最大化丙烯产率和选择性。
