[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Several studies have been performed on Pt and PtSn catalysts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the first step, propane molecules dissociate onto the catalyst surface. In the second step, a hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-position of the propane molecule. In the final step, the resulting olefin and hydrogen molecules are desorbed from the catalyst surface. The debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH is ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by making it difficult to precisely predict reaction kinetics and optimize catalyst design. The lack of consensus on the rate-controlling step suggests that multiple factors may influence the PDH reaction rate, necessitating further investigation into the reaction mechanisms on different catalyst surfaces and under varying conditions.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制包括三个步骤：脱附吸附，β-H提取和脱附。第一步，丙烷分子在催化剂表面上脱附。第二步，从丙烷分子的β位置提取一个氢原子。最后一步，产生的烯烃和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。关于脱附吸附过程或β-H提取是否是反应速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，使得难以精确预测反应动力学并优化催化剂设计。缺乏对控制步骤共识表明，多个因素可能影响PDH反应速率，需要进一步研究不同催化剂表面和不同条件下的反应机理。
