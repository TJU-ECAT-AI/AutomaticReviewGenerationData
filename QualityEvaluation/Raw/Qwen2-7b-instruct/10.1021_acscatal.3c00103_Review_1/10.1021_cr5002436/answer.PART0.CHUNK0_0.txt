[1] "For some of the newly announced PDH installations (), the industrial process to be used remains to be announced."
[2] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[3] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[4] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."

The ongoing debate regarding the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves the three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The rate-controlling step is uncertain between these two processes. The dissociative adsorption step involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond in the gas phase, while β-H extraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process, influencing the optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions for maximum efficiency. The lack of precise data on the dispersion of platinum nanoparticles across different references in Table 3 also complicates the determination of turnover frequency (TOF) for the dehydrogenation reaction.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里图-波兰尼机制的争论涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。控制速率的步骤在这些过程中存在不确定性。离解吸附步骤涉及到气相中氢键的断裂，而β-H提取涉及从吸附的丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子。不确定性识别控制速率的步骤影响我们对PDH过程的理解，影响催化剂优化和反应条件的最大效率。铂纳米颗粒在不同参考文献中的精确分布数据缺乏也使得确定脱氢反应的周转频率（TOF）变得复杂。
