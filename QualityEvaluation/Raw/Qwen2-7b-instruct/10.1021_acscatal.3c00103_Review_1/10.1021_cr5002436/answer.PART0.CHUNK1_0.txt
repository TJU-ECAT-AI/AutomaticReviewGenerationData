[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin."
[4] "Both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Isotopic labeling experiments have been used to identify the reaction intermediates."
[6] "Cofeeding D2 during ethane dehydrogenation resulted in a single deuterium being attached to the ethane molecules, suggesting an ethyl reaction intermediate."
[7] "Because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results."
[8] "During the adsorption of ethylene on both Pt and PtSn surfaces at temperatures ranging from 100 to 27 C, several species are detected, including ethylidyne as well as π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene."
[9] "Ethyl groups are only detected at very high hydrogen pressures, as these species readily convert to di-σ-ethylene otherwise."
[10] "On the contrary, DFT calculations showed that propylene is preferentially adsorbed in the disigma mode."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption of the propane molecule, extraction of the β-H atom, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and propylene. The uncertainty surrounding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction process. Both steps have been proposed as the rate-limiting step in dehydrogenation reactions, suggesting that the choice of mechanism may depend on the specific reaction conditions. This ambiguity complicates the detailed elucidation of the PDH mechanism, as it is unclear which step is more critical for the overall reaction rate. The ongoing debate over the rate-controlling step necessitates further experimental and theoretical investigations to resolve this issue and gain a more precise understanding of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个关键步骤：丙烷分子的离散吸附、β-H原子的提取，以及随后氢和丙烯的释放。关于脱氢过程中的速率控制步骤是离散吸附还是β-H提取的不确定性影响了我们对反应过程的理解。两个步骤都被提议为脱氢反应的速率限制步骤，这表明选择的机制可能取决于特定的反应条件。这种不确定性使确定PDH机制的细节变得复杂，因为不清楚哪个步骤对于整体反应速率更为关键。关于速率控制步骤的持续争议需要进一步的实验和理论研究来解决这个问题，并获得对PDH过程更精确的理解。
