[1] "The CH bonds in paraffins and olefins are considerably more reactive than CC bonds, meaning that catalysts that favor CH over CC bond cleavage are required to avoid side reactions."
[2] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[3] "Indeed, it was found that step sites are more reactive, as the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) than on the flat surface (6372 kJ mol1)."
[4] "Cr6+ or Cr5+ have not been observed to be active for the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit Cr6+/Cr5+ species do appear to be the precursor of active Cr3+ sites."
[5] "This has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction is ongoing. The uncertainty around this impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the mechanisms involved and the interplay between different reaction steps. The specific rates and relative importance of these steps can vary depending on factors such as the catalyst type and operating conditions. This variability challenges efforts to precisely model and optimize the PDH process, necessitating further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and identify key rate-determining steps.
