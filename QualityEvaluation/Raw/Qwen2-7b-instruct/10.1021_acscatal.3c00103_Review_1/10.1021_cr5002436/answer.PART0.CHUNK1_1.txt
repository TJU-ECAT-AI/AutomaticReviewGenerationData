[1] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption of the propane molecule, β-H extraction from the propane molecule, and subsequent desorption of hydrogen and olefin products. This mechanism is characterized by Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, implying that all surface sites of the catalyst are assumed to be equivalent. The debate around which step—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step in PDH continues. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by creating ambiguity in the precise sequence of events and the kinetic parameters governing the reaction. The exact rate-controlling step remains unclear, affecting predictions of reaction rates and the optimization of catalysts for PDH.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制涉及丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的三个关键步骤：丙烷分子的离散吸附、从丙烷分子中提取β-H，以及随后氢气和烯烃产品的释放。该机制遵循朗缪尔-希恩伍德动力学，暗示催化剂的所有表面位点被认为是等效的。关于脱氢反应中哪一步——离散吸附还是β-H提取——是决定性步骤的争论持续存在。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它在事件的确切顺序和控制反应速率的参数方面带来了模糊性。确定率控制步骤的具体细节仍然不清楚，这影响了对反应速率的预测和PDH催化剂的优化。
