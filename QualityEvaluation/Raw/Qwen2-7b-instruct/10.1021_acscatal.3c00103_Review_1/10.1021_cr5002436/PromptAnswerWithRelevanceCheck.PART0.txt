The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption of the propane molecule, extraction of the β-H atom, and subsequent desorption of both hydrogen and propylene. The uncertainty surrounding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction process. Both steps have been proposed as the rate-limiting step in dehydrogenation reactions, suggesting that the choice of mechanism may depend on the specific reaction conditions. This ambiguity complicates the detailed elucidation of the PDH mechanism, as it is unclear which step is more critical for the overall reaction rate. The ongoing debate over the rate-controlling step necessitates further experimental and theoretical investigations to resolve this issue and gain a more precise understanding of the PDH process.

The ongoing debate regarding the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves the three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The rate-controlling step is uncertain between these two processes. The dissociative adsorption step involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond in the gas phase, while β-H extraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process, influencing the optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions for maximum efficiency. The lack of precise data on the dispersion of platinum nanoparticles across different references in Table 3 also complicates the determination of turnover frequency (TOF) for the dehydrogenation reaction.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a theoretical model that describes the process in three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over which step is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The dissociative adsorption step involves the breaking of the propane molecule into propane radicals on the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane radical, and the desorption step is the release of the resulting propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step affects our ability to optimize the PDH process and understand the reaction mechanisms involved.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is a theoretical framework that helps us understand the propane dehydrogenation process. It includes three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is the initial process where propane molecules break down into propane radicals upon contact with the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane radical, while the desorption step is the release of the resulting propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate about which of these steps is the rate-limiting step has significant implications for the optimization of the PDH process and the understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the first step, propane molecules dissociate onto the catalyst surface. In the second step, a hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-position of the propane molecule. In the final step, the resulting olefin and hydrogen molecules are desorbed from the catalyst surface. The debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH is ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by making it difficult to precisely predict reaction kinetics and optimize catalyst design. The lack of consensus on the rate-controlling step suggests that multiple factors may influence the PDH reaction rate, necessitating further investigation into the reaction mechanisms on different catalyst surfaces and under varying conditions.

[1] "The CH bonds in paraffins and olefins are considerably more reactive than CC bonds, meaning that catalysts that favor CH over CC bond cleavage are required to avoid side reactions."
[2] "As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions."
[3] "Indeed, it was found that step sites are more reactive, as the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) than on the flat surface (6372 kJ mol1)."
[4] "The balance between dehydrogenation and these side reactions is very complex."
[5] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[7] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."
[8] "Indeed, some studies correlating dehydrogenation activity with Cr-speciation suggested that a vast majority of catalytic activity can be ascribed to the dispersed Cr3+ phase, the role of the other phases being the replenishment of the depleted Cr3+ surface phase during long runs."
[9] "This has been attributed to the fact that during this induction period, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states."
[10] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[11] "Indeed, the use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[12] "For example, when a small amount of La2O3 is added to Al2O3, the transition of θ-alumina to α-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added."
[13] "Indeed, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism begins with the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface in a dissociative manner. Next, a β-H atom is abstracted from the propane molecule, creating a propylidyne intermediate. Finally, the propylene product is desorbed from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the literature revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption step or the β-H extraction step is the rate-limiting step in the reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the need for further investigation into the specific conditions that affect each step. The precise identification of the rate-determining step can guide the optimization of catalyst design and operating conditions for maximizing propylene yield and selectivity.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding which step is rate-controlling remains unresolved, impacting our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty stems from the interplay between the energy barriers associated with these steps and the catalytic sites' accessibility. This ambiguity influences the design and optimization of dehydrogenation catalysts, as it affects the efficiency of the reaction pathway and the catalyst's lifetime. The dissociative adsorption process, where propane molecules attach to the catalyst surface and break apart, could be rate-limiting if it requires significant activation energy. Alternatively, the β-H extraction, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, might control the reaction if it is energetically demanding. The desorption step, where the resulting propylene is released, might not be the bottleneck unless it involves complex interactions with the catalyst surface. The exact role of each step depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions, making it challenging to pinpoint the rate-determining step definitively. This uncertainty guides further research into understanding the detailed mechanisms and optimizing the PDH process.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) includes three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond to release a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the cleavage of a hydrogen bond from a second hydrogen atom, forming a hydrogen molecule. Finally, desorption involves the release of both hydrogen and olefin molecules from the catalyst surface. 

There is ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Both steps have been proposed as rate-limiting, with studies suggesting that the heat of adsorption of the paraffin molecule plays a critical role. The dissociative adsorption process is often characterized by a higher heat of adsorption, which can make it the rate-controlling step. However, the β-H extraction step can also involve a significant energy barrier, potentially making it the rate-limiting step under certain conditions. 

The uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. It influences the choice of catalysts and operating conditions, as well as the development of kinetic models that accurately predict the reaction rate. Determining the precise rate-controlling step would provide insights into optimizing PDH processes for enhanced efficiency and selectivity.
