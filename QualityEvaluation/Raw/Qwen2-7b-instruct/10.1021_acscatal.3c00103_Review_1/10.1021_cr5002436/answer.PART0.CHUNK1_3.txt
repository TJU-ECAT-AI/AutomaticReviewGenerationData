[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Although the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) includes three steps: dissociative adsorption of propane, β-H extraction from the propane molecule, and subsequent desorption of hydrogen and olefin. The debate around which of these steps is the rate-controlling process impacts our understanding of the PDH process. Both the dissociative adsorption and the β-H extraction have been proposed as potential rate-limiting steps, with evidence supporting each. This uncertainty complicates the precise modeling and optimization of the PDH reaction.

PDH的逆霍里图-波兰尼机制包括三个步骤：丙烷的离散吸附、从丙烷分子中提取β-H以及随后氢和烯烃的释放。关于哪一步是控制过程的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。吸附和β-H提取都被认为可能是关键步骤，每种观点都有证据支持。这种不确定性使得精确模拟和优化PDH反应变得更加复杂。
