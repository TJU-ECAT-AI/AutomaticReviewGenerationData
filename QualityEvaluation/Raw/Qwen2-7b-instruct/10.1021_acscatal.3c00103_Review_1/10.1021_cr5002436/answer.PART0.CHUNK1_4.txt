[1] "The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."
[3] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."
[4] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Several studies have been performed on Pt and PtSn catalysts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "First, isotopic labeling experiments have been used to identify the reaction intermediates."
[7] "However, because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results."
[8] "Infrared spectroscopy is another valuable tool to detect intermediates formed during dehydrogenation reactions on Pt-based catalysts."
[9] "These relatively high heat of adsorption values are generally indicative of the dissociative adsorption of a hydrocarbon."
[10] "The dehydrogenation mechanism on chromia-based catalysts is somewhat different, as both the chromium and the oxygen atoms of the oxide are believed to participate in the reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) includes three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond to release a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the cleavage of a hydrogen bond from a second hydrogen atom, forming a hydrogen molecule. Finally, desorption involves the release of both hydrogen and olefin molecules from the catalyst surface. 

There is ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Both steps have been proposed as rate-limiting, with studies suggesting that the heat of adsorption of the paraffin molecule plays a critical role. The dissociative adsorption process is often characterized by a higher heat of adsorption, which can make it the rate-controlling step. However, the β-H extraction step can also involve a significant energy barrier, potentially making it the rate-limiting step under certain conditions. 

The uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. It influences the choice of catalysts and operating conditions, as well as the development of kinetic models that accurately predict the reaction rate. Determining the precise rate-controlling step would provide insights into optimizing PDH processes for enhanced efficiency and selectivity.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及从氢键中释放一个氢原子，将丙烷分子上的氢原子释放到催化剂表面。β-H提取步骤涉及从第二个氢原子的氢键断裂，形成氢分子。最后，脱附涉及从催化剂表面释放氢分子和烯烃分子。

关于PDH过程中哪一步是决定性步骤存在争议，是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取过程。两个步骤都被提出为决定性步骤，研究表明，烷基的吸附热在确定反应速率方面起着关键作用。解离吸附过程通常伴随着较高的吸附热，这可能使其成为决定性步骤。然而，β-H提取步骤也可能涉及显著的能量壁垒，在某些条件下可能成为决定性步骤。

对于决定性步骤的不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解。它影响催化剂的选择和操作条件，以及开发能够准确预测反应速率的热力学模型。确定确切的决定性步骤将提供优化PDH过程以提高效率和选择性的见解。
