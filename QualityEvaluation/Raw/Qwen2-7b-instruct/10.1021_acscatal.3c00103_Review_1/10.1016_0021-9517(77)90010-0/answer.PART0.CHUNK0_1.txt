"Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinum-gold alloys Abstract The rates of dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and very dilute platinumin-gold alloys have been measured."
"For both platinum and the alloys, activation energies of some 29  2 kcal/mole were measured. The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."
"It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."
"The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."
"The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."
"The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. According to the literature, the mechanism occurs as follows:

1. **Dissociative Adsorption**: Propane dissociates upon adsorption onto a single platinum atom, creating a propyl radical and an associated hydrogen atom on the adsorption sites.

2. **β-H Extraction**: The propyl radical undergoes β-hydrogen elimination, converting into π-bonded propene. This step is identified as the rate-determining step in the process.

3. **Desorption**: The π-bonded propene is then desorbed from the surface, completing the PDH process.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step centers on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is more critical. The literature suggests that β-H extraction is the rate-determining step, based on the observed reaction kinetics and activation energies. This implies that the efficiency of β-H extraction significantly influences the overall PDH rate.

The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of catalytic mechanisms. It emphasizes the importance of detailed kinetic analysis and thermodynamic studies to elucidate the specific pathways and factors influencing reaction rates in catalytic systems. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and improving the efficiency of PDH reactions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。根据文献，机制如下：

1. **解离吸附**：丙烷在单个铂原子上解离，形成丙基自由基和一个与吸附位点相关的氢原子。

2. **β-H提取**：丙基自由基经历β-H消除，转化为π键丙烯。这一步被认为是决定性步骤。

3. **脱附**：π键丙烯从表面脱附，完成PDH过程。

对于决定性步骤的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取哪个更为关键。文献表明，β-H提取是决定性步骤，基于观察到的动力学和活化能。这表明β-H提取效率显著影响整体PDH速率。

这种决定性步骤的不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，突出了催化机制的复杂性。它强调了进行详细动力学分析和热力学研究以阐明特定路径和影响反应速率因素的重要性。这些知识对于优化催化剂设计和提高PDH反应效率至关重要。
