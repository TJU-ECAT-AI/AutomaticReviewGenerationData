[1] "The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."
[2] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."
[3] "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."
[4] "The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption of propane onto a single platinum atom, β-H extraction to convert the propyl radical into π-bonded propene, and desorption of the π-bonded propene. The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The difference in the negative reaction order with respect to hydrogen between platinum and its diluted alloys suggests that the presence of gold atoms reduces the steady-state hydrogen coverage on the platinum atoms, affecting the rate-determining step.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制涉及丙烷脱氢反应的三个步骤：单个铂原子上的丙烷的离散吸附、β-H提取将丙基自由基转化为π键丙烯，以及π键丙烯的脱附。关于β-H提取过程和离散吸附过程哪个是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对脱氢反应的理解。铂及其合金中金原子的存在降低了铂原子上的稳态氢覆盖度，从而影响了决定性步骤，这一差异体现在铂与稀释合金在氢反应级数上的负差异上。
