[1] "The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."
[2] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."
[3] "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."
[4] "The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."
[5] "The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism suggests that propane is dissociatively adsorbed onto a single platinum atom, where two adsorption sites are associated, one carrying a hydrogen atom. The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene through β-hydrogen elimination is considered the rate-determining step. The desorption of π-bonded propene has a relatively low activation energy. The observed difference in the negative reaction order towards hydrogen between pure platinum and its diluted alloys indicates a lower steady-state hydrogen coverage on platinum atoms surrounded by gold atoms compared to pure platinum surfaces. This uncertainty about the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences the reaction kinetics and product yield.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制表明，丙烷在单个铂原子上以解离吸附方式吸附，并与两个吸附位点相关联，其中一个携带氢原子。随后将丙基自由基转化为π键丙烯通过β-氢消除被认为是速率决定步骤。π键丙烯的脱附具有相对较低的活化能。纯铂和其稀释合金之间负向氢反应级数的差异反映了周围有金原子的铂原子上的氢稳态覆盖度较低，与纯铂表面相比。这一关于速率决定步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应动力学和产物产率。
