[1] "The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."
[2] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."
[3] "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."
[4] "The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."
[5] "The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules attach to a single platinum atom with two associated adsorption sites, one of which carries a hydrogen atom. The β-H extraction step converts the propyl radical into π-bonded propene through the removal of a hydrogen atom. The final step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a relatively low activation energy. The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. This uncertainty highlights the complexity of the catalytic mechanism and the importance of further research to elucidate the precise role of each step in the overall reaction pathway.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子与单个铂原子结合，形成两个吸附位点，其中一个携带氢原子。β-H提取步骤通过去除氢原子将丙基自由基转化为π键合丙烯。最后一步，π键合丙烯的脱附具有相对较低的活化能。关于是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和动力学。这种不确定性凸显了催化机制的复杂性以及进一步研究以阐明每个步骤在整体反应途径中精确作用的重要性。
