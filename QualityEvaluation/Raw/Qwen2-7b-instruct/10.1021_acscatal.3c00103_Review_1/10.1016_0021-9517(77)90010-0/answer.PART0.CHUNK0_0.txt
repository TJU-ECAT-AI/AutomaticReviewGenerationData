"Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinum-gold alloys Abstract The rates of dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and very dilute platinumin-gold alloys have been measured."
"For both platinum and the alloys, activation energies of some 29  2 kcal/mole were measured."
"The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different. It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."
"The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."
"The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."
"The difference in negative reaction order, with respect to hydrogen, between platinum and its diluted alloys reflects a lower steady-state θH on Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms vis--vis Pt atoms on a Pt surface."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step involves the chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom with two associated adsorption sites, one of which carries a hydrogen atom. The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene through β-hydrogen elimination is considered the rate-determining step. Desorption of π-bonded propene has a comparably low activation energy. The observed difference in the negative reaction order towards hydrogen between pure platinum and its diluted alloys suggests a lower hydrogen coverage (θH) on platinum atoms surrounded by gold atoms compared to pure platinum surfaces.

The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH primarily revolves around understanding the specific kinetics of these steps on the surface of platinum and its alloys. The uncertainty in this debate impacts our understanding of the PDH process by influencing the interpretation of catalytic activity and efficiency, as well as the potential for modifying catalyst properties to optimize the reaction pathway.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附步骤涉及在单个铂原子上通过两个相关吸附位点的化学吸附，其中一个携带氢原子。随后将丙基自由基转化为π键丙烯通过β-氢消除被认为是决定性的步骤。π键丙烯的脱附具有相对较低的活化能。纯铂与稀释合金之间观察到的氢负反应顺序差异反映了铂原子周围有金原子的表面与纯铂表面相比，氢覆盖（θH）更低。

关于PDH过程中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是控制步骤的持续争论主要围绕理解这些步骤在纯铂和其合金表面上的具体动力学。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了催化活性和效率的解释，以及可能通过调整催化剂性质来优化反应途径的可能性。
