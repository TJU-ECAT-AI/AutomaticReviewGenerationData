The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is a widely recognized explanation for the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process (PDH). This mechanism is divided into three steps: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. There is an ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating efforts to optimize reaction conditions and catalyst design. The complexity of the PDH process includes side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, polymerization, isomerization, and coke formation. Coke deposition is identified as the dominant cause of deactivation in PDH catalysts, posing a significant challenge for further industrial application. Understanding the kinetics of coke formation is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate its effects. The rate of coke formation is influenced by the number of free active sites on the catalyst surface, and the process involves complex surface reactions and various intermediates. The high temperature required for PDH and subsequent generation processes can lead to the volatilization and leaching of catalytic components, particularly when the temperature exceeds the Tammann temperature. In the case of a PtZn/MFI zeolite catalytic system, deep dehydrogenation and coke formation were suppressed, and a detailed study revealed the loss of Zn as the key reason for deactivation, not coke formation. This highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism of sintering and the loss of active components in PDH catalysts.

逆转霍里图-波兰尼机制，于1934年由提出，是描述丙烷脱氢过程动力学的广泛认可机制。这一机制分为三个步骤：（i）烷基的离散吸附，其中一个氢原子被消除；（ii）从吸附物种中提取β-H，同时形成H2和CC双键；（iii）烯烃和H2的脱附。PDH过程中离散吸附过程或β-H提取是否为控制速率步骤的争论尚未得到确认。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为这使得优化反应条件和催化剂设计的努力变得更加复杂。PDH过程包括副反应如氢解、深度脱氢、聚合、异构化和焦炭形成。焦炭沉积被认为是PDH催化剂失效的主要原因，这对进一步的工业应用构成了重大挑战。理解焦炭形成的动力学对于开发减少其影响的策略至关重要。焦炭生成的速度受到催化剂表面自由活性位点数量的影响，并涉及复杂的表面反应和各种中间体。PDH和随后的生成过程所需的高温可能导致催化成分的挥发和流失，特别是当温度超过塔曼温度时。在以PtZn/MFI沸石催化系统的案例中，深脱氢和焦炭形成被抑制，详细研究揭示了锌的损失作为失效的关键原因，而不是焦炭形成。这突出了理解PDH催化剂的烧结和活性成分丧失机制的重要性。
