[1] "ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."
[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."
[3] "With regard to the thermodynamics, the PDH reaction is a catalytic dehydrogenation process to convert propane to propylene, as shown in reaction 1:"
[4] "To have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process, the main endothermic side reactions that may happen are also listed as follows:"

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: 
1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated.
2. Extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, accompanied by the formation of H2 and a CC double bond.
3. Desorption of the alkene and H2.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the most critical reaction phase.

The PDH reaction is thermodynamically favored as an endothermic process, converting propane to propylene. This requires high temperatures (823-973 K) and moderate pressures (1 bar) to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程分为三个部分：
1. 烷烃的解离吸附，一个氢原子被消除。
2. 从吸附物种中提取β-H，同时形成H2和一个CC双键。
3. 乙烯和H2的脱附。

PDH过程中，解离吸附步骤或β-H提取步骤哪个是速率控制步骤仍有争议。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定最关键的反应阶段变得复杂。

PDH反应在热力学上是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯。这需要高温（823-973 K）和适度压力（1巴）以达到理想的热力学平衡。

Despite being commercially available for decades, the PDH technique exhibits desirable catalytic activity with high propylene selectivity. However, coke deposition serves as the primary reason for the deactivation of PDH catalysts, posing a significant challenge for further industrial applications. The formation of coke is a complex process, involving intricate surface reactions and multiple intermediates within the PDH process. Various models have been developed to elucidate the kinetics of coke formation.

This complexity in coke formation not only leads to catalyst deactivation but also affects the catalytic stability and activity by covering or poisoning active sites and obstructing the pore structure. The accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface can lead to changes in electronic structure and increased energy barriers for deep dehydrogenation, potentially improving propylene selectivity to some extent.

Understanding the kinetics of coke formation is essential for developing strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation and enhance the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

尽管PDH技术已经商业化几十年，并显示出高丙烯选择性的理想催化活性，但焦炭沉积作为PDH催化剂失活的主要原因仍然是进一步工业应用中的重大挑战。焦炭形成的复杂性涉及PDH过程中的复杂表面反应和各种中间体。已建立多种模型来描述焦炭形成的动力学。

焦炭形成不仅导致催化剂失活，还通过覆盖或毒化活性位点和阻塞孔结构影响催化稳定性和活性。催化剂表面焦炭的积累可能导致电子结构变化和深脱氢能量壁垒增加，可能在一定程度上改善丙烯选择性。

理解焦炭形成动力学对于开发减少催化剂失活并提高PDH过程整体效率的策略至关重要。
