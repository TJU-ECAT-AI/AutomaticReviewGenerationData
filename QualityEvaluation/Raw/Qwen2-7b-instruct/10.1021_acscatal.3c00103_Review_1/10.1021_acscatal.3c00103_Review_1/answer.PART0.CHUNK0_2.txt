2. The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2.
However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed.
With regard to the thermodynamics, the PDH reaction is a catalytic dehydrogenation process to convert propane to propylene, as shown in reaction 1:

It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption of the alkane, extraction of the β-H, and desorption of the alkene and H2. The debate around which step is the rate-controlling factor in the PDH process is ongoing. The primary reaction, converting propane to propylene, is thermodynamically limited and endothermic, requiring high temperatures and moderate pressures. Understanding the mechanism helps in optimizing the process parameters for better efficiency.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over whether the dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction step is the rate-limiting factor continues. The primary reaction, converting propane to propylene, is thermodynamically controlled and endothermic, necessitating high temperatures and moderate pressures for optimal operation.

Answer: The exact step in the PDH process that controls the rate, either the dissociative adsorption of the alkane or the extraction of the β-H, is yet to be definitively determined. The thermodynamics of the PDH reaction, which converts propane to propylene, is endothermic and thermally controlled, as illustrated by reaction 1. This highlights the necessity of high temperatures and moderate pressures for achieving thermodynamic equilibrium.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Whether the dissociative adsorption of the alkane or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-determining step in the PDH process is uncertain. The thermodynamics of the PDH reaction, converting propane to propylene, is endothermic and thermally regulated, as shown in reaction 1. This emphasizes the requirement for high temperatures and moderate pressures to attain thermodynamic equilibrium.

在PDH过程中，是烷基的离解吸附还是β-H提取决定速率这一问题尚无定论。PDH反应，将丙烷转化为丙烯，具有吸热性和热力学控制性，如反应1所示。这表明在高温和适度压力下实现热力学平衡的必要性。
