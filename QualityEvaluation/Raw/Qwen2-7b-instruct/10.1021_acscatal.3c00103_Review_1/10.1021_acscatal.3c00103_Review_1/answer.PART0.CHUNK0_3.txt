[1] "ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."
[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."
[3] "With regard to the thermodynamics, the PDH reaction is a catalytic dehydrogenation process to convert propane to propylene, as shown in reaction 1:"
[4] "To have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process, the main endothermic side reactions that may happen are also listed as follows:"
[5] "It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium."

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, delineates the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process into three stages: (i) dissociative adsorption of propane, where one hydrogen atom is removed; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, accompanied by the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. The debate persists regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction phase governs the reaction rate. The thermodynamic analysis of the PDH reaction shows it is an endothermic process, thermally favored at high temperatures (823-973 K) and moderate pressures (1 bar), essential for achieving equilibrium. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing the PDH process and enhancing propylene yield.

[1] 反霍里图-波兰尼机制在1934年提出，用来描述丙烷脱氢过程的热力学动力学，将整个过程分为三个部分：（i）烷烃的解离吸附，一个氢原子被去除；（ii）从吸附物种中提取β-H，同时形成H2和CC双键；（iii）烯烃和H2的脱附。关于PDH过程中的速率控制步骤，是解离吸附还是β-H提取仍然存在争议。对PDH反应的热力学分析显示，它是一个吸热过程，在高温（823-973 K）和适度低压力（1巴）下进行，以实现热力学平衡。理解这些动态对于优化PDH过程和提高丙烯产量至关重要。
