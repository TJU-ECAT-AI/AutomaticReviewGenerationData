[1] "ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."
[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."
[3] "With regard to the thermodynamics, the PDH reaction is a catalytic dehydrogenation process to convert propane to propylene, as shown in reaction 1:"

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: 
1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated.
2. Extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species, resulting in the formation of H2 and a CC double bond.
3. Desorption of the alkene and H2. 
The debate continues regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences the kinetic behavior and efficiency of the conversion from propane to propylene.

反转霍里图-波拉尼机制描述了丙烷脱氢过程的动力学，分为三个步骤：
1. 分离吸附的烷烃，消除一个氢原子。
2. 从吸附物种中提取β-H，形成H2和CC双键。
3. 脱附烯烃和H2。 
关于PDH过程中决定速率的关键步骤是分离吸附过程还是β-H提取过程的问题仍有争议。这一不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了从丙烷转化为丙烯的反应动力学和效率。
