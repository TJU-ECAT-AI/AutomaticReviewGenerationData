[1] "Two types of catalysts, i.e. Pt/γ Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5, were used to investigate the catalyst activity and amount of coke formation on the spent catalysts."
[2] "The reactions of particular interest were the hydrocarbon oxidation and the SCR of NO with and without O2."
[3] "Propane and propene were used as the hydrocarbon sources."
[4] "In the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % coke selectivity."
[5] "With the presence of NOx, the percent conversion of both propane and propene decreased and that the % coke selectivity of propane decreased, whereas that of in propene increased."

The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature highlights the role of oxygen in affecting the selectivity of coke formation during PDH. In the absence of oxygen, propene showed higher selectivity for coke formation compared to propane. Conversely, in the presence of oxygen, propane's coke selectivity decreased while propene's increased. This indicates that oxygen influences the rate-controlling step of the PDH process, potentially shifting the balance towards either dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction based on the presence of oxygen. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-controlling remains unresolved, with oxygen's impact suggesting complexity in the mechanism.

逆霍尔维茨-波拉尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献强调了氧气在PDH过程中对焦炭选择性的影响。在无氧条件下，丙烯比丙烷显示出更高的焦炭形成选择性。相反，在有氧存在下，丙烷的焦炭选择性降低而丙烯的增加。这表明氧气影响PDH过程中的控制速率步骤，可能根据氧气的存在改变机制的平衡点。关于哪一步是控制步骤的持续争议仍未解决，氧气的影响暗示了机制的复杂性。
