[1] "Two types of catalysts, i.e. Pt/γ Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5, were used to investigate the catalyst activity and amount of coke formation on the spent catalysts."
[2] "The reactions of particular interest were the hydrocarbon oxidation and the SCR of NO with and without O2."
[3] "Propane and propene were used as the hydrocarbon sources."
[4] "For Pt/γ Al2O3 catalyst, in case of the absence of oxygen reactions, the propene conversion dropped more rapidly than the propane conversion."
[5] "Additionally, propene had a higher percent selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the absence of oxygen, but propane had a higher percent selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the presence of oxygen."
[6] "With the presence of NOx, the percent conversion of both propane and propene decreased and that the % coke selectivity of propane decreased, whereas that of in propene increased."

The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism explains how propane molecules are transformed into propylene through a series of reactions on a catalyst surface. The ongoing debate surrounds which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the conversion. In the presence of oxygen, propene showed a higher tendency for coke formation compared to propane, while in the absence of oxygen, propane exhibited a higher coke formation propensity. Moreover, the addition of nitrogen oxides (NOx) led to a decrease in the conversion of both propane and propene, with a reduced coke selectivity for propane and an increased one for propene.

逆霍尔维茨-波拉尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。这个机制解释了丙烷分子如何通过一系列反应在催化剂表面上转化为丙烯。关于哪个步骤，即解离吸附或β-H提取，在PDH过程中起决定性作用的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了转化的效率和选择性。在有氧的情况下，丙烯比丙烷更倾向于形成焦炭，而在没有氧气的情况下，丙烷显示出了更高的焦炭形成倾向。此外，氮氧化物（NOx）的加入导致了丙烷和丙烯的转化率降低，并且丙烷的焦炭选择性降低，而丙烯的焦炭选择性增加。
