[1] "Two types of catalysts, i.e. Pt/γ Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5, were used to investigate the catalyst activity and amount of coke formation on the spent catalysts."
[2] "The reactions of particular interest were the hydrocarbon oxidation and the SCR of NO with and without O2."
[3] "Propane and propene were used as the hydrocarbon sources."
[4] "In the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % coke selectivity."
[5] "With the presence of NOx, the percent conversion of both propane and propene decreased and that the % coke selectivity of propane decreased, whereas that of in propene increased."

The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature highlights the role of oxygen in affecting the selectivity of coke formation during PDH. In the absence of oxygen, propene showed higher selectivity for coke formation compared to propane. Conversely, in the presence of oxygen, propane's coke selectivity decreased while propene's increased. This indicates that oxygen influences the rate-controlling step of the PDH process, potentially shifting the balance towards either dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction based on the presence of oxygen. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-controlling remains unresolved, with oxygen's impact suggesting complexity in the mechanism.

逆霍尔维茨-波拉尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献强调了氧气在PDH过程中对焦炭选择性的影响。在无氧条件下，丙烯比丙烷显示出更高的焦炭形成选择性。相反，在有氧存在下，丙烷的焦炭选择性降低而丙烯的增加。这表明氧气影响PDH过程中的控制速率步骤，可能根据氧气的存在改变机制的平衡点。关于哪一步是控制步骤的持续争议仍未解决，氧气的影响暗示了机制的复杂性。

The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism suggests that during PDH, propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface, followed by the removal of a hydrogen atom (β-H extraction), leading to the formation of propene. However, the literature does not explicitly discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty about which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. Oxygen addition significantly changes the coke selectivity in the presence of NOx, affecting the conversion percentages of both propane and propene differently.

逆霍尔维茨-波拉尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制表明，在PDH过程中，丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附，随后去除一个氢原子（β-H提取），形成丙烯。然而，文献没有明确讨论关于PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论。关于哪个步骤是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和动力学。氧气的添加在含有NOx的情况下显著改变了焦炭选择性，不同地影响了丙烷和丙烯的转化百分比。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, there is ongoing debate within the scientific community about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in this process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of PDH because it influences how efficiently propane is converted to propene under various conditions. In the context of the study, the addition of oxygen significantly altered the coke selectivity, demonstrating that the presence of oxygen can influence the mechanism's efficiency and the selectivity of the products formed during PDH.

The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism explains how propane molecules are transformed into propylene through a series of reactions on a catalyst surface. The ongoing debate surrounds which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the conversion. In the presence of oxygen, propene showed a higher tendency for coke formation compared to propane, while in the absence of oxygen, propane exhibited a higher coke formation propensity. Moreover, the addition of nitrogen oxides (NOx) led to a decrease in the conversion of both propane and propene, with a reduced coke selectivity for propane and an increased one for propene.

逆霍尔维茨-波拉尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。这个机制解释了丙烷分子如何通过一系列反应在催化剂表面上转化为丙烯。关于哪个步骤，即解离吸附或β-H提取，在PDH过程中起决定性作用的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了转化的效率和选择性。在有氧的情况下，丙烯比丙烷更倾向于形成焦炭，而在没有氧气的情况下，丙烷显示出了更高的焦炭形成倾向。此外，氮氧化物（NOx）的加入导致了丙烷和丙烯的转化率降低，并且丙烷的焦炭选择性降低，而丙烯的焦炭选择性增加。
