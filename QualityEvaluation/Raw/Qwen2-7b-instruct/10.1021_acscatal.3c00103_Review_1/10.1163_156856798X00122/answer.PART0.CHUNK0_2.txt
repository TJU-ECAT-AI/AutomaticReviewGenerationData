[1] "Two types of catalysts, i.e. Pt/γ Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5, were used to investigate the catalyst activity and amount of coke formation on the spent catalysts."
[2] "The reactions of particular interest were the hydrocarbon oxidation and the SCR of NO with and without O2."
[3] "Propane and propene were used as the hydrocarbon sources."
[4] "In the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % coke selectivity."
[5] "With the presence of NOx, the percent conversion of both propane and propene decreased and that the % coke selectivity of propane decreased, whereas that of in propene increased."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, there is ongoing debate within the scientific community about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in this process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of PDH because it influences how efficiently propane is converted to propene under various conditions. In the context of the study, the addition of oxygen significantly altered the coke selectivity, demonstrating that the presence of oxygen can influence the mechanism's efficiency and the selectivity of the products formed during PDH.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个关键步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。然而，科学界对此机制中哪一步，解吸附吸附或β-H提取，作为速率控制步骤存在争议。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH的理解，因为它影响了在不同条件下丙烷转化为丙烯的效率。在研究背景下，氧气的添加显著改变了焦炭选择性，这表明氧气的存在可以影响机制的效率及其形成的产品的选择性。
