[1] "Two types of catalysts, i.e. Pt/γ Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5, were used to investigate the catalyst activity and amount of coke formation on the spent catalysts."
[2] "The reactions of particular interest were the hydrocarbon oxidation and the SCR of NO with and without O2."
[3] "Propane and propene were used as the hydrocarbon sources."
[4] "In the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % coke selectivity."
[5] "With the presence of NOx, the percent conversion of both propane and propene decreased and that the % coke selectivity of propane decreased, whereas that of in propene increased."

The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism suggests that during PDH, propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface, followed by the removal of a hydrogen atom (β-H extraction), leading to the formation of propene. However, the literature does not explicitly discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty about which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. Oxygen addition significantly changes the coke selectivity in the presence of NOx, affecting the conversion percentages of both propane and propene differently.

逆霍尔维茨-波拉尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制表明，在PDH过程中，丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附，随后去除一个氢原子（β-H提取），形成丙烯。然而，文献没有明确讨论关于PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论。关于哪个步骤是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和动力学。氧气的添加在含有NOx的情况下显著改变了焦炭选择性，不同地影响了丙烷和丙烯的转化百分比。
