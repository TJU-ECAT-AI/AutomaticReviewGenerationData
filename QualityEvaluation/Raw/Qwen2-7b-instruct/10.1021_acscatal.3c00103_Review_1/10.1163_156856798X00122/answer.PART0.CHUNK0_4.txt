[1] "Two types of catalysts, i.e. Pt/γ Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5, were used to investigate the catalyst activity and amount of coke formation on the spent catalysts."
[2] "The reactions of particular interest were the hydrocarbon oxidation and the SCR of NO with and without O2."
[3] "Propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of O2 and/or NO."
[4] "For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, in the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % coke selectivity."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, there is ongoing debate within the scientific community regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The document highlights that propene provides higher conversion and coke deposition compared to propane under various conditions. For the Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst, the addition of oxygen significantly changes the coke selectivity, indicating the importance of oxygen in controlling the PDH reaction.

逆霍里图-波拉尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。然而，科学界内部存在争议，争论是在这个反应中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是决定性步骤。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。文献指出，丙烯在各种条件下提供的转化率和焦炭沉积量高于丙烷。对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂，氧气的添加显著改变了焦炭选择性，表明氧气在控制PDH反应中的重要性。
