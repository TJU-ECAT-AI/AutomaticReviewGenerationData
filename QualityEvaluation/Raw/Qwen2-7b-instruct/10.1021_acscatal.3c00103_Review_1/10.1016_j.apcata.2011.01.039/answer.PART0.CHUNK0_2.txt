The kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments.

The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step.

The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen.

A complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism is often debated in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling factor. The uncertainty around this mechanism impacts our understanding of PDH as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The kinetic model established in the study identifies the first CH cleavage in propane as the rate-determining step, aligning with both experimental data and quantum chemistry calculations. The model also integrates a coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, accounting for the effects of propene and hydrogen on the rate of coke formation. This approach avoids the need for in situ measurement of coke content, simplifying the modeling process while maintaining predictive capability.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。关于哪个步骤是控制速率的因素，这个机制在科学界经常被辩论。对这个机制的不确定性影响我们对PDH的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。研究中建立的模型将一步或两步脱氢考虑在内，并通过实验数据评估了反应机理。该模型确定了丙烷分子中的第一个CH键断裂为决定速率的步骤，与实验数据和量子化学计算的结果一致。该模型还整合了焦化形成动力学模型到失活模型中，考虑丙烯和氢气对焦化速率的影响。这种方法避免了原位测量焦炭含量的需求，简化了建模过程，同时保持了预测能力。
