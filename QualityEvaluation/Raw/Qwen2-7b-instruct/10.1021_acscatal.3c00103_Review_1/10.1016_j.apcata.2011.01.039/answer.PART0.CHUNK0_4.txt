2.2. Propane cracking
In preliminary propane dehydrogenation experiments on the PtSn catalyst, only methane and ethene were detected as cracking products, which is in good agreement with the results reported by Wu et al.
[28] . Therefore in addition to propane dehydrogenation, the side reaction considered is the cracking of propane to methane and ethylene, i.e.

The propane cracking reaction, considered in addition to dehydrogenation, involves the conversion of propane to methane and ethylene. The rate of this reaction is assumed to be directly proportional to the concentration of propane present, following a first-order reaction kinetics.

4.2. Effects of mass and heat transports on the reactions
Catalysts with four different averaged diameters were used to investigate the influences of internal mass diffusion. The experiments were carried out at 600 C, the highest temperature in the interested temperature region. The W/F was kept 30 g min/mol constant.
Fig. 1 shows that the initial propane conversions of propane did not change remarkably when the size of the catalyst was smaller than 0.3 mm. Therefore, catalyst with an averaged size of 0.15 mm was employed in the experiments to eliminate the influences of pore diffusion.

To examine the impact of internal mass diffusion, catalysts with varying average diameters were utilized in experiments conducted at 600°C, the highest temperature within the targeted temperature range. Maintaining the weight-to-flow rate (W/F) constant at 30 g min/mol, Figure 1 demonstrates that the initial conversion of propane was not notably affected when the catalyst size was below 0.3 mm. Consequently, a catalyst with an average diameter of 0.15 mm was selected for the experiments to mitigate the effects of pore diffusion.

为了研究内部质量扩散的影响，使用了不同平均直径的催化剂，在600°C下进行实验，这是感兴趣的温度范围内的最高温度。保持重量对流量率（W/F）恒定在30 g min/mol，图1表明，当催化剂尺寸低于0.3 mm时，初始丙烷转化率并没有明显变化。因此，选择了一个平均直径为0.15 mm的催化剂用于实验，以消除孔扩散的影响。

4.3. Propane conversions at different conditions
The effects of temperature, propane, propene and hydrogen pressures on propane dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. 3 (ad), respectively. Propane conversion increases remarkably with temperature ( Fig. 3 (a)) as expected. The conversion decreases with time on stream and more rapidly at higher temperatures owing to faster catalyst deactivation. The propane conversion decreases with increasing propene concentration ( Fig. 3 (c)), but is only slightly influenced by hydrogen concentration ( Fig. 3 (d)). It indicates a strong adsorption of propene, which occupies most of the surfaces. High propene concentration decreases the free site for adsorption of the reactant molecules, and thus lowers the reaction rate. Although no significant effect of hydrogen on propane dehydrogenation is observed, the deactivation rate is lower at higher hydrogen concentration. It indicates an inhibition of coke formation by hydrogen. The deactivation rate depends more strongly on propene ( Fig. 3 (c)) than on propane ( Fig. 3 (b)). It implies that propene instead of propane is possibly the coking precursor.

The impacts of temperature, propane, propene, and hydrogen pressures on propane dehydrogenation are illustrated in Figure 3 (ad). As expected, propane conversion significantly increases with temperature (Figure 3(a)). The conversion decreases over time due to catalyst deactivation, which accelerates at higher temperatures. The propane conversion decreases with an increase in propene concentration (Figure 3(c)), whereas it is only slightly affected by hydrogen concentration (Figure 3(d)). This suggests that propene exhibits a strong adsorption capacity, occupying most of the surface sites. A higher propene concentration reduces the available sites for adsorption of reactant molecules, consequently decreasing the reaction rate. Although hydrogen does not show a significant effect on propane dehydrogenation, a lower deactivation rate is observed at higher hydrogen concentrations, indicating that hydrogen inhibits coke formation. The deactivation rate is more closely linked to propene (Figure 3(c)) than to propane (Figure 3(b)), suggesting that propene might be the primary precursor for coke formation rather than propane.

丙烷脱氢过程中，温度、丙烷、丙烯以及氢气压力的影响分别如图3(ad)所示。如预期的那样，随着温度的升高，丙烷转化率显著增加（图3(a)）。随时间延长，转化率降低，尤其是在较高温度下更为迅速，这是由于催化剂活性的加速衰减。丙烷转化率随丙烯浓度的增加而降低（图3(c)），但受氢气浓度的影响较小（图3(d)）。这表明丙烯具有较强的吸附能力，占据大部分表面。较高的丙烯浓度减少了可供吸附反应分子的活性位点，从而降低了反应速率。尽管氢气对丙烷脱氢影响不大，但在高氢气浓度下，脱活速率较低，这表明氢气抑制了焦炭形成。脱活速率与丙烯（图3(c)）的关系比与丙烷（图3(b)）更为紧密，暗示丙烯可能是焦炭形成的主要前体，而不是丙烷。
