The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism has been widely debated in the scientific community. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-controlling step, while others believe that the β-H extraction is more critical. The uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects how we interpret the reaction kinetics and the factors influencing the reaction rate. If the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-controlling step, then the adsorption of propane molecules plays a crucial role in determining the overall reaction rate. Conversely, if β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, then the removal of hydrogen atoms from propane molecules becomes the key factor in controlling the reaction rate. This debate highlights the complexity of PDH and the need for further research to clarify the underlying mechanisms and to develop more accurate kinetic models.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷裂解（PDH）的三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。这种机制在科学界引起了广泛的争论。一些研究人员认为解离吸附过程是决定性步骤，而其他人则认为β-H提取更为关键。不确定性关于决定性步骤影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响我们如何解释反应动力学以及影响反应速率的因素。如果解离吸附过程是决定性步骤，则丙烷分子的吸附在确定整体反应速率方面起着关键作用。相反，如果β-H提取是决定性步骤，则从丙烷分子中去除氢原子成为控制反应速率的关键因素。这场辩论凸显了PDH的复杂性和进一步研究澄清基本机制并开发更准确的动力学模型的必要性。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption of propane onto the surface, extraction of a β-H atom, and subsequent desorption of propene. There is a current debate about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction constitutes the rate-determining step. This ambiguity complicates the elucidation of the PDH process's rate-limiting step and overall mechanism.

The kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments.

The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step.

The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen.

A complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism is often debated in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling factor. The uncertainty around this mechanism impacts our understanding of PDH as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The kinetic model established in the study identifies the first CH cleavage in propane as the rate-determining step, aligning with both experimental data and quantum chemistry calculations. The model also integrates a coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, accounting for the effects of propene and hydrogen on the rate of coke formation. This approach avoids the need for in situ measurement of coke content, simplifying the modeling process while maintaining predictive capability.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。关于哪个步骤是控制速率的因素，这个机制在科学界经常被辩论。对这个机制的不确定性影响我们对PDH的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。研究中建立的模型将一步或两步脱氢考虑在内，并通过实验数据评估了反应机理。该模型确定了丙烷分子中的第一个CH键断裂为决定速率的步骤，与实验数据和量子化学计算的结果一致。该模型还整合了焦化形成动力学模型到失活模型中，考虑丙烯和氢气对焦化速率的影响。这种方法避免了原位测量焦炭含量的需求，简化了建模过程，同时保持了预测能力。

4.2. Effects of mass and heat transports on the reactions
Catalysts with four different averaged diameters were used to investigate the influences of internal mass diffusion. The experiments were carried out at 600 C, the highest temperature in the interested temperature region. The W/F was kept 30 g min/mol constant.
Fig. 1 shows that the initial propane conversions of propane did not change remarkably when the size of the catalyst was smaller than 0.3 mm. Therefore, catalyst with an averaged size of 0.15 mm was employed in the experiments to eliminate the influences of pore diffusion.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To examine the impact of internal mass diffusion, catalysts with varying average diameters were utilized in experiments conducted at 600°C, the highest temperature within the targeted temperature range. Maintaining the weight-to-flow rate (W/F) constant at 30 g min/mol, Figure 1 demonstrates that the initial conversion of propane was not notably affected when the catalyst size was below 0.3 mm. Consequently, a catalyst with an average diameter of 0.15 mm was selected for the experiments to mitigate the effects of pore diffusion.

为了研究内部质量扩散的影响，使用了不同平均直径的催化剂，在600°C下进行实验，这是感兴趣的温度范围内的最高温度。保持重量对流量率（W/F）恒定在30 g min/mol，图1表明，当催化剂尺寸低于0.3 mm时，初始丙烷转化率并没有明显变化。因此，选择了一个平均直径为0.15 mm的催化剂用于实验，以消除孔扩散的影响。

4.3. Propane conversions at different conditions
The effects of temperature, propane, propene and hydrogen pressures on propane dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. 3 (ad), respectively. Propane conversion increases remarkably with temperature ( Fig. 3 (a)) as expected. The conversion decreases with time on stream and more rapidly at higher temperatures owing to faster catalyst deactivation. The propane conversion decreases with increasing propene concentration ( Fig. 3 (c)), but is only slightly influenced by hydrogen concentration ( Fig. 3 (d)). It indicates a strong adsorption of propene, which occupies most of the surfaces. High propene concentration decreases the free site for adsorption of the reactant molecules, and thus lowers the reaction rate. Although no significant effect of hydrogen on propane dehydrogenation is observed, the deactivation rate is lower at higher hydrogen concentration. It indicates an inhibition of coke formation by hydrogen. The deactivation rate depends more strongly on propene ( Fig. 3 (c)) than on propane ( Fig. 3 (b)). It implies that propene instead of propane is possibly the coking precursor.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The impacts of temperature, propane, propene, and hydrogen pressures on propane dehydrogenation are illustrated in Figure 3 (ad). As expected, propane conversion significantly increases with temperature (Figure 3(a)). The conversion decreases over time due to catalyst deactivation, which accelerates at higher temperatures. The propane conversion decreases with an increase in propene concentration (Figure 3(c)), whereas it is only slightly affected by hydrogen concentration (Figure 3(d)). This suggests that propene exhibits a strong adsorption capacity, occupying most of the surface sites. A higher propene concentration reduces the available sites for adsorption of reactant molecules, consequently decreasing the reaction rate. Although hydrogen does not show a significant effect on propane dehydrogenation, a lower deactivation rate is observed at higher hydrogen concentrations, indicating that hydrogen inhibits coke formation. The deactivation rate is more closely linked to propene (Figure 3(c)) than to propane (Figure 3(b)), suggesting that propene might be the primary precursor for coke formation rather than propane.

丙烷脱氢过程中，温度、丙烷、丙烯以及氢气压力的影响分别如图3(ad)所示。如预期的那样，随着温度的升高，丙烷转化率显著增加（图3(a)）。随时间延长，转化率降低，尤其是在较高温度下更为迅速，这是由于催化剂活性的加速衰减。丙烷转化率随丙烯浓度的增加而降低（图3(c)），但受氢气浓度的影响较小（图3(d)）。这表明丙烯具有较强的吸附能力，占据大部分表面。较高的丙烯浓度减少了可供吸附反应分子的活性位点，从而降低了反应速率。尽管氢气对丙烷脱氢影响不大，但在高氢气浓度下，脱活速率较低，这表明氢气抑制了焦炭形成。脱活速率与丙烯（图3(c)）的关系比与丙烷（图3(b)）更为紧密，暗示丙烯可能是焦炭形成的主要前体，而不是丙烷。
