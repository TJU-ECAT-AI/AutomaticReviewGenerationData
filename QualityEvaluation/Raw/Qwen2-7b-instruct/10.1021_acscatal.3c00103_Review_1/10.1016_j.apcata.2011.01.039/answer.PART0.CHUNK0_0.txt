The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism has been widely debated in the scientific community. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-controlling step, while others believe that the β-H extraction is more critical. The uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects how we interpret the reaction kinetics and the factors influencing the reaction rate. If the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-controlling step, then the adsorption of propane molecules plays a crucial role in determining the overall reaction rate. Conversely, if β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, then the removal of hydrogen atoms from propane molecules becomes the key factor in controlling the reaction rate. This debate highlights the complexity of PDH and the need for further research to clarify the underlying mechanisms and to develop more accurate kinetic models.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷裂解（PDH）的三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。这种机制在科学界引起了广泛的争论。一些研究人员认为解离吸附过程是决定性步骤，而其他人则认为β-H提取更为关键。不确定性关于决定性步骤影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响我们如何解释反应动力学以及影响反应速率的因素。如果解离吸附过程是决定性步骤，则丙烷分子的吸附在确定整体反应速率方面起着关键作用。相反，如果β-H提取是决定性步骤，则从丙烷分子中去除氢原子成为控制反应速率的关键因素。这场辩论凸显了PDH的复杂性和进一步研究澄清基本机制并开发更准确的动力学模型的必要性。
