[1] "The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of propane onto the surface is followed by the β-H extraction, and finally the desorption of propene."
[3] "There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction."
[4] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the rate-limiting step and the overall reaction mechanism."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption of propane onto the surface, extraction of a β-H atom, and subsequent desorption of propene. There is a current debate about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction constitutes the rate-determining step. This ambiguity complicates the elucidation of the PDH process's rate-limiting step and overall mechanism.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应包含三个连续步骤：丙烷在表面的离解吸附、β-H原子提取，以及随后丙烯的脱附。目前关于该步骤是离解吸附还是β-H提取决定速率的问题存在争议。这种不确定性使确定速率限制步骤和整体反应机制变得复杂。
