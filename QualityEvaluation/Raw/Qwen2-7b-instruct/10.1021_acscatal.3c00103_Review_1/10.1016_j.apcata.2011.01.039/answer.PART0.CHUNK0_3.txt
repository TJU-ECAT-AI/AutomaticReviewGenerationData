The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty surrounding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction has led to ongoing debate. This ambiguity impacts our understanding of the PDH process because the rate-controlling step directly influences the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. The kinetic model established for propane dehydrogenation identifies the first CH cleavage in the propane molecule as the rate-determining step. This conclusion aligns with experimental observations and quantum chemistry calculations, providing a clearer picture of the PDH mechanism.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于该反应中离解吸附或β-H提取是控制速率步骤的争论持续存在，这影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。因为控制速率的步骤直接影响反应的效率和动力学。建立的丙烷脱氢动力学模型将第一个CH键断裂的丙烷分子确定为决定性步骤。这一结论与实验观察和量子化学计算相一致，为理解PDH机制提供了更清晰的画面。
