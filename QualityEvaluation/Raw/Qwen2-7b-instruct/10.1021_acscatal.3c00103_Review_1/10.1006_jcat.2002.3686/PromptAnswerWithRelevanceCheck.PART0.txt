Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not directly discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. However, it does provide insights into the deactivation of catalysts containing chromium and alumina, which could be related to the PDH process. The deactivation mechanisms involve entrapment of Cr3+ ions within the alumina support and migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support. The presence of γ-alumina hinders the migration of Cr3+ ions, and the phase of the alumina support does not significantly affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species. The turnover frequency is higher for multinuclear Cr3+ sites compared to isolated Cr3+ sites.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献没有直接讨论关于是否解吸附吸附或β-H提取是控制速率步骤的争论。然而，它提供了有关含铬和氧化铝催化剂的不可逆失活的信息，这可能与PDH过程相关。失活机制包括铬3+离子在氧化铝支撑体内的捕获以及铬3+离子进入氧化铝支撑体。γ-氧化铝的存在阻碍了铬3+离子的迁移，且氧化铝支撑体的相对其表面铬3+物种的活性影响不大。多核铬3+位点的周转频率高于孤立的铬3+位点。

The literature does not provide details on the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. However, it does state that the presence of γ-alumina inhibits the migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support, which could imply that the rate of β-H extraction might be influenced by the phase transformation of alumina. Furthermore, the literature mentions that the turnover frequency is higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+ sites, suggesting that the arrangement of Cr3+ ions might affect the reaction kinetics. Lastly, the phase of the alumina support does not appear to affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species, indicating that other factors might be more critical in determining the reaction rate.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。文献没有提供关于在该反应中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续辩论的详细信息。然而，它确实指出γ-Al2O3的存在抑制了Cr3+离子进入Al2O3支持体，这可能意味着α-Al2O3相的形成可能影响β-H提取的速率。此外，文献提到多核Cr3+的转速频率高于孤立Cr3+位点，表明Cr3+离子的排列可能会影响反应动力学。最后，Al2O3支持体的相似乎不影响表面Cr3+物种的活性，这表明其他因素可能更关键于确定反应速率。

The study investigates the irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts subjected to prolonged calcination in air at temperatures up to 1200°C. Two mechanisms are identified for the formation of inactive alumina-incorporated Cr3+ species: (i) Cr3+ ions being trapped inside the alumina support during sintering, and (ii) Cr3+ ions migrating into the alumina support. The presence of γ-alumina inhibits the transformation to α-alumina and hinders the migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina. Multinuclear Cr3+ sites have a higher turnover frequency compared to isolated Cr3+ sites. The alumina phase does not seem to influence the activity of surface Cr3+ species.
