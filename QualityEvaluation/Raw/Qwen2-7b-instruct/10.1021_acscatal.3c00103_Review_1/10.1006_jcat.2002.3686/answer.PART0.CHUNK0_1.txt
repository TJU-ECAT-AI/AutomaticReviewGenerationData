[1] "Irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts was investigated by deactivating the catalysts (4 wt% Cr) through prolonged calcination in air at temperatures up to 1200C."
[2] "Two deactivation mechanisms were responsible for the formation of catalytically inactive alumina-incorporated Cr3+ species: (i) entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the alumina support during sintering of the alumina support and (ii) migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support."
[3] "Chromia that had been impregnated on alumina inhibited the phase transformation from γ- to α-alumina."
[4] "The presence of γ-alumina, in turn, hindered the migration of Cr3+ ions into alumina."
[5] "The turnover frequency was higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+ sites."
[6] "The phase of the alumina support did not appear to affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not provide details on the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. However, it does state that the presence of γ-alumina inhibits the migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support, which could imply that the rate of β-H extraction might be influenced by the phase transformation of alumina. Furthermore, the literature mentions that the turnover frequency is higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+ sites, suggesting that the arrangement of Cr3+ ions might affect the reaction kinetics. Lastly, the phase of the alumina support does not appear to affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species, indicating that other factors might be more critical in determining the reaction rate.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。文献没有提供关于在该反应中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续辩论的详细信息。然而，它确实指出γ-Al2O3的存在抑制了Cr3+离子进入Al2O3支持体，这可能意味着α-Al2O3相的形成可能影响β-H提取的速率。此外，文献提到多核Cr3+的转速频率高于孤立Cr3+位点，表明Cr3+离子的排列可能会影响反应动力学。最后，Al2O3支持体的相似乎不影响表面Cr3+物种的活性，这表明其他因素可能更关键于确定反应速率。
