The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not directly discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. However, it does provide insights into the deactivation of catalysts containing chromium and alumina, which could be related to the PDH process. The deactivation mechanisms involve entrapment of Cr3+ ions within the alumina support and migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support. The presence of γ-alumina hinders the migration of Cr3+ ions, and the phase of the alumina support does not significantly affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species. The turnover frequency is higher for multinuclear Cr3+ sites compared to isolated Cr3+ sites.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献没有直接讨论关于是否解吸附吸附或β-H提取是控制速率步骤的争论。然而，它提供了有关含铬和氧化铝催化剂的不可逆失活的信息，这可能与PDH过程相关。失活机制包括铬3+离子在氧化铝支撑体内的捕获以及铬3+离子进入氧化铝支撑体。γ-氧化铝的存在阻碍了铬3+离子的迁移，且氧化铝支撑体的相对其表面铬3+物种的活性影响不大。多核铬3+位点的周转频率高于孤立的铬3+位点。
