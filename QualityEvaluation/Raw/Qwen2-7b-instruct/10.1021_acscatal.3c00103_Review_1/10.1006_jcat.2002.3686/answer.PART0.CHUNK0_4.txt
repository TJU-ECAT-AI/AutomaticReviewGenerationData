<i>Regular Article Spectroscopic Study on the Irreversible Deactivation of Chromia/Alumina Dehydrogenation Catalysts</i> - Abstract
<p>Irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts was investigated by deactivating the catalysts (4 wt% Cr) through prolonged calcination in air at temperatures up to 1200C.</p>
<p>Nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the UV-visible region, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and catalytic measurements revealed that two deactivation mechanisms were responsible for the formation of catalytically inactive alumina-incorporated Cr3+ species:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the alumina support during sintering of the alumina support</li>
<li>(ii) migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromia that had been impregnated on alumina inhibited the phase transformation from γ- to α-alumina. The presence of γ-alumina, in turn, hindered the migration of Cr3+ ions into alumina.</p>
<p>The turnover frequency was higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+ sites. The phase of the alumina support did not appear to affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species.</p>

The study investigates the irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, focusing on two deactivation mechanisms: entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the alumina support during sintering and migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support. These mechanisms lead to the formation of catalytically inactive alumina-incorporated Cr3+ species. The presence of γ-alumina inhibits the migration of Cr3+ ions, affecting the activity of the surface Cr3+ species.

研究探讨了氧化铬/氧化铝脱氢催化剂的不可逆失活，关注两种失活机制：在氧化铝支撑体烧结过程中Cr3+离子的捕获和Cr3+离子向氧化铝支撑体的迁移。这些机制导致形成催化活性降低的氧化铝嵌入的Cr3+物种。γ-氧化铝的存在抑制了Cr3+离子的迁移，影响表面Cr3+物种的活性。
