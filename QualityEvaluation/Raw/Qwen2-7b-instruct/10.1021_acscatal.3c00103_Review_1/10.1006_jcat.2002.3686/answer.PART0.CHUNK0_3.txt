The study investigates the irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts subjected to prolonged calcination in air at temperatures up to 1200°C. Two mechanisms are identified for the formation of inactive alumina-incorporated Cr3+ species: (i) Cr3+ ions being trapped inside the alumina support during sintering, and (ii) Cr3+ ions migrating into the alumina support. The presence of γ-alumina inhibits the transformation to α-alumina and hinders the migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina. Multinuclear Cr3+ sites have a higher turnover frequency compared to isolated Cr3+ sites. The alumina phase does not seem to influence the activity of surface Cr3+ species.

研究考察了在空气气氛下进行长达1200°C的长时间煅烧对氧化铬/氧化铝脱氢催化剂不可逆失活的影响。发现两种机制导致形成含有活性降低的氧化铝掺杂Cr3+物种：（i）在氧化铝支撑体烧结过程中Cr3+离子被捕获在支撑体内部，（ii）Cr3+离子迁移到氧化铝支撑体中。γ-氧化铝的存在抑制了向α-氧化铝的相变，并阻碍了Cr3+离子进入氧化铝。多核Cr3+位点的周转频率高于孤立的Cr3+位点。氧化铝相似乎不影响表面Cr3+物种的活性。
