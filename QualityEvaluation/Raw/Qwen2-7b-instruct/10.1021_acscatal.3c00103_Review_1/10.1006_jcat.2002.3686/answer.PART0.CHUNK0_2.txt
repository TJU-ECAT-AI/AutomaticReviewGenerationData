The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not directly address the ongoing debate over which step is rate-controlling, as it focuses on the irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts. However, it does reveal that two deactivation mechanisms are responsible for the formation of catalytically inactive alumina-incorporated Cr3+ species. These mechanisms involve entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the alumina support during sintering and migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support. The presence of γ-alumina inhibits the migration of Cr3+ ions into alumina, while the phase of the alumina support does not affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species. The turnover frequency is higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+ sites.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及丙烷脱氢（PDH）的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献没有直接讨论争论中的哪个步骤是控制速率的，因为它专注于铬氧化铝脱氢催化剂的不可逆失活。然而，它揭示了两种失活机制负责形成催化活性的氧化铝掺杂Cr3+物种。这些机制涉及在氧化铝支持材料烧结过程中捕获Cr3+离子和Cr3+离子进入氧化铝支持材料。γ-氧化铝的存在阻碍了Cr3+离子进入氧化铝。氧化铝的相态似乎不影响表面Cr3+物种的活性。多核Cr3+的周转频率高于孤立的Cr3+位点。
