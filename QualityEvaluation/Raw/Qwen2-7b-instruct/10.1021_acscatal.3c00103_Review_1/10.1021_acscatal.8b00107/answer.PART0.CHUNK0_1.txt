<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty influences our comprehension of the PDH process.
