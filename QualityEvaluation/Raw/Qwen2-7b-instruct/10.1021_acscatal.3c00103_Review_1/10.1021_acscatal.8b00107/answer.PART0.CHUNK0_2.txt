1. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ambiguity concerning whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction governs the reaction rate affects our comprehension of the PDH process.
