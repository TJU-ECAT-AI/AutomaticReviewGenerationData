1. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate continues over which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-determining step in this reaction. This ambiguity influences our comprehension of the PDH process.
