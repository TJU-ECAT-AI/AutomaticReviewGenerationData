The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step influences our comprehension of the PDH process.
