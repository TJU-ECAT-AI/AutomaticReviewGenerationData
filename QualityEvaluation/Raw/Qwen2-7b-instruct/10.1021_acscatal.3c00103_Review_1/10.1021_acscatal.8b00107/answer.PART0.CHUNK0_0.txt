Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three essential stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The process features an unresolved debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-determining step. This ambiguity affects our comprehension of the PDH process, influencing approaches to catalyst design and optimization.
