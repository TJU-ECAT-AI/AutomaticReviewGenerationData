<p>It should be pointed hear that the promoting effect observed in the case of Cr2.0SiBeta is similar to those observed on Cr-based catalysts supported on ordered or unordered mesoporous silicas.</p>
<p>In the latter case, CO2 addition enhance only partially propene formation (10-25%).</p>
<p>Comparing to others catalytic systems, for instance palladium supported on Ce-based supports the promoting the effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is moderate.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules break apart upon contacting the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule. Desorption follows, where the resulting alkene molecule is released from the catalyst surface. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH is ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The literature indicates that in Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, the presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture enhances propene formation to a similar extent as observed in other Cr-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas. However, this enhancing effect is generally moderate compared to other catalytic systems, such as palladium supported on ceria-based supports, where CO2 has a more pronounced effect on propene formation. The specific contribution of the dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction steps to the overall reaction rate varies among different catalyst systems, influencing the overall catalytic performance and the efficiency of propene production.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时破裂的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从吸附的丙烷分子中抽象出一个氢原子。脱附随之而来，释放出从催化剂表面释放的烯烃分子。关于PDH过程中解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的辩论正在进行中。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。文献表明，在Cr含有的Beta沸石催化剂中，在反应混合物中添加CO2可以增强丙烯形成，类似于其他Cr基催化剂支持在微孔硅上的情况。然而，这种增强效果通常比其他催化系统（例如，钯支持在铈基支持上）的丙烯形成作用要温和。不同催化剂系统中解离吸附和β-H提取步骤对整体反应速率的贡献各不相同，影响总体催化性能和丙烯生产的效率。
