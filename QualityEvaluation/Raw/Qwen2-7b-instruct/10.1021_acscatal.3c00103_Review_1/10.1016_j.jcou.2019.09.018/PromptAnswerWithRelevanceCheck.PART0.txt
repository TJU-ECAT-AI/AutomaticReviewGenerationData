<p>It should be pointed hear that the promoting effect observed in the case of Cr2.0SiBeta is similar to those observed on Cr-based catalysts supported on ordered or unordered mesoporous silicas.</p>
<p>In the latter case, CO2 addition enhance only partially propene formation (10-25%).</p>
<p>Comparing to others catalytic systems, for instance palladium supported on Ce-based supports the promoting the effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is moderate.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules break apart upon contacting the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule. Desorption follows, where the resulting alkene molecule is released from the catalyst surface. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH is ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The literature indicates that in Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, the presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture enhances propene formation to a similar extent as observed in other Cr-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas. However, this enhancing effect is generally moderate compared to other catalytic systems, such as palladium supported on ceria-based supports, where CO2 has a more pronounced effect on propene formation. The specific contribution of the dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction steps to the overall reaction rate varies among different catalyst systems, influencing the overall catalytic performance and the efficiency of propene production.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时破裂的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从吸附的丙烷分子中抽象出一个氢原子。脱附随之而来，释放出从催化剂表面释放的烯烃分子。关于PDH过程中解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的辩论正在进行中。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。文献表明，在Cr含有的Beta沸石催化剂中，在反应混合物中添加CO2可以增强丙烯形成，类似于其他Cr基催化剂支持在微孔硅上的情况。然而，这种增强效果通常比其他催化系统（例如，钯支持在铈基支持上）的丙烯形成作用要温和。不同催化剂系统中解离吸附和β-H提取步骤对整体反应速率的贡献各不相同，影响总体催化性能和丙烯生产的效率。

[1] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed."
[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are split into fragments before being adsorbed onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the step where a hydrogen atom is removed from one fragment to form propene. Desorption is the final step where the propene is released from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate centers on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of propene production. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the process enhances propene formation over chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts, suggesting that CO2 facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane through the PDH pathway rather than an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway involving direct oxidation of chromium species.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附前被分裂成片段的过程。β-H提取是步骤，其中从一个片段中移除一个氢原子形成丙烯。脱附是最后一步，从催化剂表面释放出丙烯。争论的焦点在于解离吸附或β-H提取是否是控制速率的步骤。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响丙烯生产的效率和选择性。二氧化碳（CO2）的存在增强了丙烯的形成，表明CO2通过PDH途径促进丙烷脱氢，而不是涉及直接氧化铬物种的氧化脱氢途径。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is a contentious debate in the scientific community about which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-determining step in the reaction. This ambiguity has implications for our understanding of the PDH process, influencing how reaction kinetics are modeled and affecting the design of catalysts for effective propane dehydrogenation.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate about which step is the rate-controlling factor in this reaction remains unresolved. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the key catalytic steps. The literature suggests that the presence of redox chromium species is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Additionally, the study indicates that the promoting effect of CO2 on propylene formation is observed specifically on dealuminated Beta zeolite catalysts, enhancing both yield and selectivity to propene. Furthermore, a correlation is found between the number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance in a series of CrxSiBeta catalysts.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪个步骤是控制速率的关键，在这个反应中仍然存在争议。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定关键催化步骤变得复杂。文献表明，氧化还原铬物种的存在对于实现CO2-PDH过程的高催化性能至关重要。此外，研究指出，二氧化碳促进丙烯形成的效果仅在去铝化后的Beta沸石催化剂上观察到，这提高了丙烯的产率和选择性。进一步的研究发现，红氧化铬物种的数量与催化剂性能之间存在相关性，在一系列CrxSiBeta催化剂中。

<p>It is clear that dealumination significantly improve both activity and selectivity. In the case of Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst, the low selectivity to propylene is due to high concentration of strong acid sites over AlBeta support which prefer cracking of propane.</p>
<p>In series of CrxSiBeta catalysts a correlation between number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance was found.</p>
<p>Typically, the yield rises with the increase of total Cr content up to the maximum value (monolayer coverage). After exceeding the monolayer coverage of support the redox Cr species are no longer stabilized (attached directly with support) and during the preparation there are decompose to less active and non-redox Cr2O3 particles.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The dealumination process leads to improved activity and selectivity in the CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation process. The Cr2.0AlBeta catalyst, with a high concentration of strong acid sites, has low selectivity towards propylene due to its preference for propane cracking.

2. There is a correlation between the number of redox chromium species and the catalytic performance in the CrxSiBeta catalyst series. The yield increases with the total chromium content until reaching a maximum (monolayer coverage). Beyond this point, the redox chromium species become unstable and decompose into less active and non-redox chromium oxide particles.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 去铝化过程能显著提高活性和选择性，特别是在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢过程中。Cr2.0AlBeta催化剂具有高浓度强酸位点，因此其丙烯选择性低，因为它更倾向于丙烷裂解。

2. 在CrxSiBeta催化剂系列中，红氧化铬物种的数量与催化性能之间存在相关性。随着总铬含量的增加，产率会上升，直到达到最大值（单层覆盖率）。超过这一点后，红氧化铬物种变得不稳定并分解成活性较低且非红氧化铬氧化物颗粒。
