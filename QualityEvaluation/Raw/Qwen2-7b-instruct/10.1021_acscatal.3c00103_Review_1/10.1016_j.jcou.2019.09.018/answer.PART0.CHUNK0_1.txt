[1] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed."
[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are split into fragments before being adsorbed onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the step where a hydrogen atom is removed from one fragment to form propene. Desorption is the final step where the propene is released from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate centers on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of propene production. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the process enhances propene formation over chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts, suggesting that CO2 facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane through the PDH pathway rather than an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway involving direct oxidation of chromium species.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附前被分裂成片段的过程。β-H提取是步骤，其中从一个片段中移除一个氢原子形成丙烯。脱附是最后一步，从催化剂表面释放出丙烯。争论的焦点在于解离吸附或β-H提取是否是控制速率的步骤。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响丙烯生产的效率和选择性。二氧化碳（CO2）的存在增强了丙烯的形成，表明CO2通过PDH途径促进丙烷脱氢，而不是涉及直接氧化铬物种的氧化脱氢途径。
