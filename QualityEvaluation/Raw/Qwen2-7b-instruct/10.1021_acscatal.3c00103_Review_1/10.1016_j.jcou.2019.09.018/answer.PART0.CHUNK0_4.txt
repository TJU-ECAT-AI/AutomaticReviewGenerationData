1. The dealumination process leads to improved activity and selectivity in the CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation process. The Cr2.0AlBeta catalyst, with a high concentration of strong acid sites, has low selectivity towards propylene due to its preference for propane cracking.

2. There is a correlation between the number of redox chromium species and the catalytic performance in the CrxSiBeta catalyst series. The yield increases with the total chromium content until reaching a maximum (monolayer coverage). Beyond this point, the redox chromium species become unstable and decompose into less active and non-redox chromium oxide particles.

1. 去铝化过程能显著提高活性和选择性，特别是在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢过程中。Cr2.0AlBeta催化剂具有高浓度强酸位点，因此其丙烯选择性低，因为它更倾向于丙烷裂解。

2. 在CrxSiBeta催化剂系列中，红氧化铬物种的数量与催化性能之间存在相关性。随着总铬含量的增加，产率会上升，直到达到最大值（单层覆盖率）。超过这一点后，红氧化铬物种变得不稳定并分解成活性较低且非红氧化铬氧化物颗粒。
