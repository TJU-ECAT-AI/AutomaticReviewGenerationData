The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is a contentious debate in the scientific community about which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-determining step in the reaction. This ambiguity has implications for our understanding of the PDH process, influencing how reaction kinetics are modeled and affecting the design of catalysts for effective propane dehydrogenation.
