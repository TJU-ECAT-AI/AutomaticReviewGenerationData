<p>The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed.</p>
<p>In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.</p>
<p>Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air.</p>
<p>A comparative catalytic results indicate that the promoting effect of CO2 propylene formation was observed on Cr2.0SiBeta. On this dealuminated form of Beta zeolite both the yield and selectivity to propene rise in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>Moreover, in series of CrxSiBeta catalysts a correlation between number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance was found.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate about which step is the rate-controlling factor in this reaction remains unresolved. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the key catalytic steps. The literature suggests that the presence of redox chromium species is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Additionally, the study indicates that the promoting effect of CO2 on propylene formation is observed specifically on dealuminated Beta zeolite catalysts, enhancing both yield and selectivity to propene. Furthermore, a correlation is found between the number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance in a series of CrxSiBeta catalysts.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪个步骤是控制速率的关键，在这个反应中仍然存在争议。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定关键催化步骤变得复杂。文献表明，氧化还原铬物种的存在对于实现CO2-PDH过程的高催化性能至关重要。此外，研究指出，二氧化碳促进丙烯形成的效果仅在去铝化后的Beta沸石催化剂上观察到，这提高了丙烯的产率和选择性。进一步的研究发现，红氧化铬物种的数量与催化剂性能之间存在相关性，在一系列CrxSiBeta催化剂中。
