The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Researchers are currently divided on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-determining step in this reaction. This ambiguity affects our comprehension of the PDH process.
