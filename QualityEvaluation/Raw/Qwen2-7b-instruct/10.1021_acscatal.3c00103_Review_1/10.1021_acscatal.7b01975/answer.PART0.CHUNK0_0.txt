[1] "Reflecting morphological changes at the nanoscale, sintering will usually manifest itself in decreased catalytic activity or selectivity. Sintering is particularly detrimental for nanostructured catalysts because:(i) available active surface area decreases, thus reducing the overall active site density, which is crucial especially when utilizing expensive materials (e.g., noble metals, engineered nanostructures);(ii) small particles may contain large fractions of specific active sites, such as undercoordinated atoms at edges, corners, and vertices, (11) that are lost if particles change morphology and/or size;(iii) electronic properties may change, as those of small particles are different from larger ones, which could provide very different adsorption energies of reactants on the catalytic active phase (12) and thus very different reactivity."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty affects how the reaction is modeled and optimized in industrial settings. The debate over the rate-controlling step influences the selection of catalysts and reaction conditions, as each step has implications for the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process. The choice of the rate-controlling step can lead to different insights into the reaction mechanisms and guide the development of more effective catalysts and process conditions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性影响了工业设置中反应的建模和优化。关于速率控制步骤的争论影响了催化剂的选择和反应条件，因为每个步骤都对PDH过程的整体效率和选择性有影响。选择速率控制步骤可以导致对反应机制的不同见解，并指导开发更有效的催化剂和工艺条件。
