<p>Unfortunately, the literature provided does not contain any information that is relevant to the questions asked about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the rate-controlling step in this reaction, or the ongoing debate regarding the dissociative adsorption process versus β-H extraction. Therefore, there are no relevant quotes to extract.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature for the questions regarding the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation, the debate over the rate-controlling step, and the dissociative adsorption versus β-H extraction processes. The literature focuses on catalyst sintering and strategies to prevent it, not on PDH or the related catalytic mechanisms.

没有在提供的文献中找到与问题有关的引文，这些问题涉及反霍里图蒂-波兰尼机制、丙烷脱氢反应的速率控制步骤以及离解吸附与β-H提取过程之间的争论。文献主要关注催化剂结块的问题及其预防策略，而不是PDH或相关催化机制。
