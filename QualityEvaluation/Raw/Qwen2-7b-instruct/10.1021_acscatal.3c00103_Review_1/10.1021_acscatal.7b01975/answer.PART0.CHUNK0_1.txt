The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a bond in propane upon its adsorption onto a catalyst surface, forming a reactive intermediate. The β-H extraction step removes a hydrogen atom from this intermediate, leading to the formation of propylene. The desorption step releases the propylene product from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate in the field revolves around which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the need for further research to elucidate the kinetic details of each step. The lack of consensus on the rate-controlling step also underscores the importance of developing strategies that can effectively address the limitations posed by the current understanding of the PDH mechanism.

The uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step in the PDH process has significant implications for the development of more stable and efficient catalysts. Addressing this uncertainty requires a deeper understanding of the underlying sintering mechanisms, the ability to distinguish between different sintering processes, and the implementation of techniques that can characterize these processes under realistic conditions. By improving our understanding of the PDH mechanism and the factors that contribute to catalyst instability, researchers can design more effective antisintering strategies that not only mitigate the root cause of sintering but also enhance the overall performance and longevity of the catalysts used in PDH reactions.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个连续步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指在催化剂表面吸附丙烷时，丙烷分子内部的键被断裂，形成一个活性中间体。β-H提取步骤从这个中间体中移除一个氢原子，产生丙烯。脱附步骤则将丙烯产物从催化剂表面释放出来。在PDH过程中，解离吸附步骤还是β-H提取步骤是控制速率步骤的问题一直存在争议。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它强调了反应机制的复杂性，并且需要进一步的研究来阐明每个步骤的热力学细节。对控制速率步骤的不确定性的存在也凸显出开发能够有效解决当前PDH机制理解限制的策略的重要性。

PDH过程中的催化剂不稳定性的根本原因不确定性对催化剂的稳定性和效率的提升具有重要意义。要解决这一不确定性，需要更深入地了解底层的烧结机制、区分不同的烧结过程，并实施能够在实际条件下表征这些过程的技术。通过改善对PDH机制和导致催化剂不稳定因素的理解，研究人员可以设计出更有效的抗烧结策略，这些策略不仅能够缓解烧结的根本原因，还能增强用于PDH反应的催化剂的整体性能和使用寿命。
