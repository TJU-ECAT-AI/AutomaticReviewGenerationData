The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the surface of the catalyst in a partially dissociated state, where the hydrogen atoms are not fully attached to the carbon atoms. β-H extraction is the process of extracting hydrogen atoms from the dissociated propane molecule. Desorption is the final step where the resulting products, such as propylene, are released from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the more critical process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the precise identification of the reaction pathways and rate-determining steps. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations can help elucidate the structure-function relationship and catalytic mechanism, thereby guiding the design of more efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

The uncertainty about the rate-controlling step in the PDH process affects our understanding of the reaction dynamics. It is essential for developing more efficient catalysts and optimizing the PDH process. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical models can help clarify the structure-function relationship and catalytic mechanism, which are crucial for the design of high-performance catalysts. The complexity of the PDH mechanism underscores the importance of detailed studies on the reaction pathways and the roles of different catalyst properties.

In the PDH process, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism includes three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the partial dissociation of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction follows, where hydrogen atoms are extracted from the dissociated propane molecule. The final step is desorption, where the resulting products, such as propylene, are released from the catalyst surface. The debate about the rate-controlling step in PDH focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction drives the reaction more significantly. This uncertainty influences our understanding of the PDH process, as it complicates the identification of the reaction pathways and rate-limiting stages. To address this, advanced characterization methods and theoretical analyses can help elucidate the structure-function relationship and catalytic mechanism, providing insights into designing more efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）中涉及的三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面以部分离解状态吸附，氢原子未完全与碳原子相连。β-H提取是指从离解的丙烷分子中提取氢原子的过程。脱附是最后一步，产物如丙烯从催化剂表面释放出来。关于PDH过程中控制速率的步骤的争论集中在离解吸附或β-H提取是否更为关键。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使精确识别反应途径和速率决定步骤变得复杂。高级表征技术以及理论计算可以帮助阐明结构-功能关系和催化机制，从而指导设计更高效的催化剂。
