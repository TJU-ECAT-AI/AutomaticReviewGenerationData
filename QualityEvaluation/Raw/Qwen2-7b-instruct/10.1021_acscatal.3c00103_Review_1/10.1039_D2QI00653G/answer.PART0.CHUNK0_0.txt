[1] "Zeolite-supported metal catalysts have exhibited excellent activity and superhigh stability in PDH reactions, which even exceed that of industrial catalysts, suggesting their great application prospects."
[2] "The performances of monometallic Pt catalysts are far from satisfactory in most cases."
[3] "The large ensembles of monometal Pt surface atoms are active for the deep dehydrogenation of propane, causing the formation of coke and undesirable byproducts, resulting in fast deactivation and low selectivity for propylene."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond between propane molecules, allowing them to attach to the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the process where a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule is abstracted, leading to the formation of propylene and hydrogen. Desorption is the final step where the propylene molecule is released from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in the PDH process centers on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the bottleneck. Some studies suggest that dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, while others argue that β-H extraction controls the overall reaction rate. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the development of catalysts with enhanced performance. Determining the rate-controlling step would allow for targeted improvements in catalyst design and synthesis to optimize the PDH reaction efficiency.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及丙烷分子之间氢键的断裂，使它们能够附着到催化剂表面。β-H提取过程涉及从丙烷分子中抽取一个氢原子，形成丙烯和氢气。最后一步是脱附，丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放出来。

PDH过程中的速率控制步骤的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取是否是控制整体反应速率的关键。一些研究认为解离吸附是限制步骤，而其他研究则认为β-H提取控制了整个反应速率。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，复杂化了催化剂性能优化的工作。确定速率控制步骤将允许针对目标改进催化剂设计和合成，以优化PDH反应效率。
