The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-limiting process in PDH. This uncertainty affects our comprehension of the PDH process, guiding the selection of catalysts and operational parameters.
