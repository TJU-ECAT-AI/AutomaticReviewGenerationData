The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond between propane molecules, allowing them to attach to the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the process where a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule is abstracted, leading to the formation of propylene and hydrogen. Desorption is the final step where the propylene molecule is released from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in the PDH process centers on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the bottleneck. Some studies suggest that dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, while others argue that β-H extraction controls the overall reaction rate. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the development of catalysts with enhanced performance. Determining the rate-controlling step would allow for targeted improvements in catalyst design and synthesis to optimize the PDH reaction efficiency.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及丙烷分子之间氢键的断裂，使它们能够附着到催化剂表面。β-H提取过程涉及从丙烷分子中抽取一个氢原子，形成丙烯和氢气。最后一步是脱附，丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放出来。

PDH过程中的速率控制步骤的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取是否是控制整体反应速率的关键。一些研究认为解离吸附是限制步骤，而其他研究则认为β-H提取控制了整个反应速率。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，复杂化了催化剂性能优化的工作。确定速率控制步骤将允许针对目标改进催化剂设计和合成，以优化PDH反应效率。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the surface of the catalyst in a partially dissociated state, where the hydrogen atoms are not fully attached to the carbon atoms. β-H extraction is the process of extracting hydrogen atoms from the dissociated propane molecule. Desorption is the final step where the resulting products, such as propylene, are released from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the more critical process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the precise identification of the reaction pathways and rate-determining steps. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations can help elucidate the structure-function relationship and catalytic mechanism, thereby guiding the design of more efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

The uncertainty about the rate-controlling step in the PDH process affects our understanding of the reaction dynamics. It is essential for developing more efficient catalysts and optimizing the PDH process. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical models can help clarify the structure-function relationship and catalytic mechanism, which are crucial for the design of high-performance catalysts. The complexity of the PDH mechanism underscores the importance of detailed studies on the reaction pathways and the roles of different catalyst properties.

In the PDH process, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism includes three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the partial dissociation of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction follows, where hydrogen atoms are extracted from the dissociated propane molecule. The final step is desorption, where the resulting products, such as propylene, are released from the catalyst surface. The debate about the rate-controlling step in PDH focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction drives the reaction more significantly. This uncertainty influences our understanding of the PDH process, as it complicates the identification of the reaction pathways and rate-limiting stages. To address this, advanced characterization methods and theoretical analyses can help elucidate the structure-function relationship and catalytic mechanism, providing insights into designing more efficient catalysts for PDH reactions.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface in a manner that breaks the C-C bonds, allowing for β-H extraction. This step is often debated in the literature regarding whether it or the β-H extraction step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. The uncertainty about which step controls the reaction rate impacts our understanding of the PDH mechanism. The strong interaction between Pt species and the framework Sn species in the PtSn catalysts inhibits aggregation and coke deposition, enhancing the catalyst's stability. The PtZn catalysts, particularly those with intermetallic compounds, demonstrate high propylene selectivity due to the facilitation of propylene desorption. The introduction of K+ ions in the PtSn catalyst enhances stability, and the high-entropy alloy PtZn-DeAlBEA shows remarkable long-term stability, with only a 10% loss of its initial activity after 160 hours on stream.

The high stability of the PtZn catalysts, attributed to the strong interaction of Pt atoms with SiOZnOH groups, prevents sintering and promotes high selectivity for propylene. The optimization of synthetic conditions and the selection of suitable metal precursors, along with the introduction of heteroatoms and defects, can improve the dispersion and stability of metal species, affecting the catalytic activity. The development of novel synthesis strategies to prepare zeolite-supported metal catalysts with high PDH performance is essential for advancing the field.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制的丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附是指以断裂C-C键的方式将丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面，允许β-H提取。关于该步骤还是β-H提取步骤是反应速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH机制的理解。关于哪个步骤控制反应速率的不确定性影响了对PDH过程的理解。在PtSn催化剂中，Pt物种与框架Sn物种之间的强相互作用抑制了聚合和焦炭沉积，提高了催化剂稳定性。PtZn催化剂，特别是那些具有互金属化合物的，由于促进了丙烯的脱附而表现出高丙烯选择性。引入K+离子在PtSn催化剂中显著增强了稳定性，而高熵合金PtZn-DeAlBEA则显示出出色的长寿命稳定性，在连续反应160小时后，其初始活性仅损失了10%。

PtZn催化剂的高稳定性归因于Pt原子与SiOZnOH基团的强相互作用，防止了聚集并促进了丙烯的选择性。优化合成条件以及选择合适的金属前体，结合异质原子和缺陷的引入，可以改善金属物种的分散性和稳定性，影响催化活性。开发新型合成策略，以制备具有高PDH性能的沸石支持金属催化剂对于推进该领域的发展至关重要。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step is ongoing. The uncertainty around this impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects how we interpret the kinetics and mechanisms involved in the reaction. The presence of K+ ions in the zeolite structure is known to enhance the dispersion of metal species and reduce their size, which is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH reaction. The size difference between the metal nanoparticles in the calcination-reduction method (around 2.7 nm) and impregnation method (around 6.4 nm) highlights the importance of synthesis method in controlling particle size. The PtSn4@S-1-H catalyst, optimized for the PDH reaction, demonstrated a remarkable propylene selectivity of 99.3% with a high initial propane conversion of 47.4% at 550 C. The use of Cs+ ions in the catalyst helped maintain its activity during thermal regeneration processes, preventing the aggregation and leaching of metal species. This indicates that the stabilization of metal species within zeolite structures plays a significant role in the catalytic activity of PDH reactions.
