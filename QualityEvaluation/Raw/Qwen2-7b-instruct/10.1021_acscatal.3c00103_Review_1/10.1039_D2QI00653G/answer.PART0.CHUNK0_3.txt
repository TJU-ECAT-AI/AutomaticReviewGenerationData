[1] "Zeolite-supported metal catalysts have exhibited excellent activity and superhigh stability in PDH reactions, which even exceed that of industrial catalysts, suggesting their great application prospects."
[2] "The large ensembles of monometal Pt surface atoms are active for the deep dehydrogenation of propane, causing the formation of coke and undesirable byproducts, resulting in fast deactivation and low selectivity for propylene."
[3] "Zeolite-supported PtSn catalysts have shown excellent catalytic performances in PDH reactions."
[4] "The introduction of K+ ions in the zeolites was conducive to the dispersion of metal species and reducing the metal size."
[5] "In contrast, the size of the metal nanoparticles in Pt@S-1-C synthesized via the calcination-reduction method and Pt/S-1 catalyst prepared via the impregnation method was around 2.7 and 6.4 nm, respectively."
[6] "The optimized PtSn4@S-1-H exhibited superhigh propylene selectivity of 99.3% with 47.4% initial propane conversion at 550 C."
[7] "This could be mainly attributed to the fact that the Cs+ ions were located inside the zeolite channels, preventing the migration of the metal species during the thermal regeneration processes under high temperatures and avoiding their aggregation and/or leaching."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step is ongoing. The uncertainty around this impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects how we interpret the kinetics and mechanisms involved in the reaction. The presence of K+ ions in the zeolite structure is known to enhance the dispersion of metal species and reduce their size, which is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH reaction. The size difference between the metal nanoparticles in the calcination-reduction method (around 2.7 nm) and impregnation method (around 6.4 nm) highlights the importance of synthesis method in controlling particle size. The PtSn4@S-1-H catalyst, optimized for the PDH reaction, demonstrated a remarkable propylene selectivity of 99.3% with a high initial propane conversion of 47.4% at 550 C. The use of Cs+ ions in the catalyst helped maintain its activity during thermal regeneration processes, preventing the aggregation and leaching of metal species. This indicates that the stabilization of metal species within zeolite structures plays a significant role in the catalytic activity of PDH reactions.

逆Horita-Polanyi机制包括三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于离解吸附或β-H提取是否是速率控制步骤的争论仍在进行中。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了我们对反应动力学和机制的解释。钾离子在沸石结构中的存在已知可以增强金属物种的分散并减小它们的尺寸，这对于PDH反应的效率至关重要。通过比较热解还原法（约2.7 nm）和浸渍法（约6.4 nm）得到的金属纳米颗粒的尺寸差异，突出了合成方法在控制颗粒尺寸方面的重要性。优化后的PtSn4@S-1-H催化剂，在550°C下实现了高达99.3%的丙烯选择性和47.4%的初始丙烷转化率。使用Cs+离子有助于催化剂在其热再生过程中保持其活性，防止金属物种的聚集和泄漏。这表明，将金属物种稳定在沸石结构中对于PDH反应的催化活性具有重要意义。
