[1] "Zeolite-supported metal catalysts have exhibited excellent activity and superhigh stability in PDH reactions, which even exceed that of industrial catalysts."
[2] "The performances of monometallic Pt catalysts are far from satisfactory in most cases."
[3] "The large ensembles of monometal Pt surface atoms are active for the deep dehydrogenation of propane, causing the formation of coke and undesirable byproducts, resulting in fast deactivation and low selectivity for propylene."
[4] "Constructing a bimetal system not only can modify the electronic structure state of the Pt species, but also be beneficial to increase the dispersion of Pt species, resulting in improved selectivity for propylene and conversion of propane."
[5] "The introduction of another metal into Pt species can also remarkably enhance their long-term stability in PDH reactions by preventing coking and sintering of the catalyst."
[6] "The PDH tests showed that the optimized PtSn catalyst achieved 65% propane conversion and over 95% propylene selectivity."
[7] "The optimized PtSn catalyst also exhibited outstanding long-term stability, maintaining nearly half of its initial propane conversion even after 20 days on stream."
[8] "The strong interaction between Pt species and framework Sn species largely inhibited the aggregation of Pt species and retarded the coke deposition rate, and the synergy of bimetallic PtSn was responsible for the high propylene selectivity."
[9] "The introduction of K+ ions could remarkably enhance the stability during the PDH reaction, where more than 40% propane conversion was maintained with a slight decrease in propylene selectivity even after 65 h on stream over K-PtSn@S-1."
[10] "The high stability in PDH reactions of the PtZn-DeAlBEA catalyst was attributed to the strong interaction of Pt atoms with multiple SiOZnOH groups, which could remarkably inhibit the sintering of the Pt atoms."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface in a manner that breaks the C-C bonds, allowing for β-H extraction. This step is often debated in the literature regarding whether it or the β-H extraction step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. The uncertainty about which step controls the reaction rate impacts our understanding of the PDH mechanism. The strong interaction between Pt species and the framework Sn species in the PtSn catalysts inhibits aggregation and coke deposition, enhancing the catalyst's stability. The PtZn catalysts, particularly those with intermetallic compounds, demonstrate high propylene selectivity due to the facilitation of propylene desorption. The introduction of K+ ions in the PtSn catalyst enhances stability, and the high-entropy alloy PtZn-DeAlBEA shows remarkable long-term stability, with only a 10% loss of its initial activity after 160 hours on stream.

The high stability of the PtZn catalysts, attributed to the strong interaction of Pt atoms with SiOZnOH groups, prevents sintering and promotes high selectivity for propylene. The optimization of synthetic conditions and the selection of suitable metal precursors, along with the introduction of heteroatoms and defects, can improve the dispersion and stability of metal species, affecting the catalytic activity. The development of novel synthesis strategies to prepare zeolite-supported metal catalysts with high PDH performance is essential for advancing the field.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制的丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附是指以断裂C-C键的方式将丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面，允许β-H提取。关于该步骤还是β-H提取步骤是反应速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH机制的理解。关于哪个步骤控制反应速率的不确定性影响了对PDH过程的理解。在PtSn催化剂中，Pt物种与框架Sn物种之间的强相互作用抑制了聚合和焦炭沉积，提高了催化剂稳定性。PtZn催化剂，特别是那些具有互金属化合物的，由于促进了丙烯的脱附而表现出高丙烯选择性。引入K+离子在PtSn催化剂中显著增强了稳定性，而高熵合金PtZn-DeAlBEA则显示出出色的长寿命稳定性，在连续反应160小时后，其初始活性仅损失了10%。

PtZn催化剂的高稳定性归因于Pt原子与SiOZnOH基团的强相互作用，防止了聚集并促进了丙烯的选择性。优化合成条件以及选择合适的金属前体，结合异质原子和缺陷的引入，可以改善金属物种的分散性和稳定性，影响催化活性。开发新型合成策略，以制备具有高PDH性能的沸石支持金属催化剂对于推进该领域的发展至关重要。
