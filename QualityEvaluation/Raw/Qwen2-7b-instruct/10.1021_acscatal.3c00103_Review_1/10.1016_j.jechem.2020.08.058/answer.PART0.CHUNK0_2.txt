The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is a persistent discussion in the scientific community about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction phase governs the reaction rate. This ambiguity affects our comprehension of the PDH process.
