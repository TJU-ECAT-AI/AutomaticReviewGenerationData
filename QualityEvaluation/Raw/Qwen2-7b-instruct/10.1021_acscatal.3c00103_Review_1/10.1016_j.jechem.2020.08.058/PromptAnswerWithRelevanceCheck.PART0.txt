The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of the C-H bond of propane on the catalyst surface, forming an adsorbed alkyl radical and a hydrogen atom. The β-H extraction step removes the hydrogen atom from the surface, and the final desorption step releases the product propylene from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty affects the design and optimization of catalysts for efficient propane conversion to propylene. The catalysts optimized for each step may exhibit different activities and stability characteristics, influencing the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波纳伊机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附涉及在催化剂表面破坏丙烷中的C-H键，形成吸附的烷基自由基和一个氢原子。β-H提取步骤从表面移除氢原子，最终脱附步骤从表面释放产物丙烯。关于离解吸附或β-H提取是否是控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性影响了对高效丙烷转化为丙烯过程的设计和优化。针对每个步骤优化的催化剂可能表现出不同的活性和稳定性特征，这将影响PDH过程的整体效率。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption process involves the breaking of the C-H bond in propane to form a propylene molecule and a hydrogen atom adsorbed onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step removes the hydrogen atom from the surface, forming propylene. The desorption step allows the propylene molecule to leave the surface and enter the gas phase.

The ongoing debate in the PDH process revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty about this impacts our understanding of the PDH process because the rate-controlling step determines the overall efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. If dissociative adsorption is the rate-controlling step, then improving the adsorption ability of the catalyst would enhance the reaction rate. Conversely, if β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, then improving the catalyst's ability to efficiently remove hydrogen atoms would lead to increased propylene production rates.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step influences our understanding of the PDH process, as it determines the overall efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. Improving the adsorption ability or hydrogen atom removal capability of the catalyst could enhance propylene production rates.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附过程涉及丙烷中C-H键的断裂，形成丙烯分子和吸附在催化剂表面的氢原子。β-H提取步骤从表面移除氢原子，形成丙烯。脱附步骤允许丙烯分子离开表面并进入气相。

PDH过程中关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。因为它决定了反应的整体效率和动力学。如果解离吸附是控制步骤，则提高催化剂的吸附能力会增强反应速率。相反，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，则提高催化剂有效移除氢原子的能力会导致更高的丙烯生成速率。

答案：逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附三个步骤。关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的争论影响了对PDH过程的理解，因为它决定了反应的整体效率和动力学。提高催化剂的吸附能力或氢原子移除能力可以增强丙烯生成速率。

Optimizing zeolite stabilized Pt-Zn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene. The Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts are constructed with Zn species stabilized by silanols from the zeolite framework dealumination, acting as anchoring sites for Pt species. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and electronic interaction thereof make the catalysts robust for PDH. Under optimized conditions, a high propylene production rate of 4.11, high propylene selectivity of 98%, and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h\(^{-1}\) can be achieved at 823 K. Coke deposition is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation; rather, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species under high temperatures are responsible for the irreversible deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reaction.
