[1] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction."
[2] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation."
[3] "On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH is ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the most influential reaction pathway and the factors affecting reaction kinetics. The mechanism's complexity suggests that multiple steps may contribute to the overall reaction rate, necessitating a comprehensive approach to elucidating the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于PDH中离解吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的争论仍然存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定最影响力的反应途径和影响反应动力学的因素变得复杂。该机制的复杂性表明，多个步骤可能共同决定整体反应速率，需要采取全面的方法来阐明PDH过程。
