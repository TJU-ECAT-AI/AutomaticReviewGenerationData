Optimizing zeolite stabilized Pt-Zn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene. The Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts are constructed with Zn species stabilized by silanols from the zeolite framework dealumination, acting as anchoring sites for Pt species. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and electronic interaction thereof make the catalysts robust for PDH. Under optimized conditions, a high propylene production rate of 4.11, high propylene selectivity of 98%, and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h\(^{-1}\) can be achieved at 823 K. Coke deposition is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation; rather, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species under high temperatures are responsible for the irreversible deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reaction.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate surrounding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty in this mechanism highlights the complexity of the reaction pathway and the interplay between adsorption and desorption processes. The choice between these two steps as the rate-determining factor can influence the efficiency and kinetics of the PDH reaction, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于解吸附吸附或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的辩论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这个机制中的不确定性凸显了反应途径的复杂性和吸附与脱附过程之间的相互作用。选择这两个步骤中哪一个作为决定性步骤会影响PDH反应的效率和动力学，从而影响整个催化剂性能。
