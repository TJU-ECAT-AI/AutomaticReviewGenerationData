[1] "Propane, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates [1] , is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
[2] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] ."
[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
[4] "The good catalytic performance of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta in the reaction is well explained [26] , and the deactivation mechanism is finally discussed."
[5] "The aggregation of Pt species indicates the spatial separation of Pt and Zn species and the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction [49] ,[50] ,[51] , which is not good for PDH reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of the C-H bond of propane on the catalyst surface, forming an adsorbed alkyl radical and a hydrogen atom. The β-H extraction step removes the hydrogen atom from the surface, and the final desorption step releases the product propylene from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty affects the design and optimization of catalysts for efficient propane conversion to propylene. The catalysts optimized for each step may exhibit different activities and stability characteristics, influencing the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波纳伊机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附涉及在催化剂表面破坏丙烷中的C-H键，形成吸附的烷基自由基和一个氢原子。β-H提取步骤从表面移除氢原子，最终脱附步骤从表面释放产物丙烯。关于离解吸附或β-H提取是否是控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性影响了对高效丙烷转化为丙烯过程的设计和优化。针对每个步骤优化的催化剂可能表现出不同的活性和稳定性特征，这将影响PDH过程的整体效率。
