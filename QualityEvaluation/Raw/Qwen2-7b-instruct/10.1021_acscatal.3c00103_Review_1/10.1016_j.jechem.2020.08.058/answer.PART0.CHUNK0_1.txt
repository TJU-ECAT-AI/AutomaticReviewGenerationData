[1] "Propene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates [1] , is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
[2] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] ."
[3] "That is, Zn species could disperse well on Si-Beta zeolite support and the aggregation of Zn species to bulky ZnO particles could be significantly suppressed [14] ."
[4] "The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support."
[5] "Generally, 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates of below 100 nm."
[6] "With the introduction of Pt into 2Zn/Si-Beta, an ammonia desorption peak centered at 443 K with much higher intensity could be observed on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta."
[7] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof."
[8] "Interestingly, upon the addition of trace Pt into 2Zn/Si-Beta zeolite, significant improvement in propane conversion and propylene selectivity can be simultaneously obtained."
[9] "In order to obtain an optimal PDH catalyst, the effects of Pt and Zn loadings in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts on PDH performance were further investigated."
[10] "Typically, stable propylene selectivity of 98% and high propylene yield of 63% are achieved on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst at 823 K."
[11] "A very high initial propylene production rate of 1.89 with propylene selectivity of 98% is achieved for 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[12] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 with an acceptable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption process involves the breaking of the C-H bond in propane to form a propylene molecule and a hydrogen atom adsorbed onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step removes the hydrogen atom from the surface, forming propylene. The desorption step allows the propylene molecule to leave the surface and enter the gas phase.

The ongoing debate in the PDH process revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty about this impacts our understanding of the PDH process because the rate-controlling step determines the overall efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. If dissociative adsorption is the rate-controlling step, then improving the adsorption ability of the catalyst would enhance the reaction rate. Conversely, if β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, then improving the catalyst's ability to efficiently remove hydrogen atoms would lead to increased propylene production rates.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step influences our understanding of the PDH process, as it determines the overall efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. Improving the adsorption ability or hydrogen atom removal capability of the catalyst could enhance propylene production rates.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附过程涉及丙烷中C-H键的断裂，形成丙烯分子和吸附在催化剂表面的氢原子。β-H提取步骤从表面移除氢原子，形成丙烯。脱附步骤允许丙烯分子离开表面并进入气相。

PDH过程中关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。因为它决定了反应的整体效率和动力学。如果解离吸附是控制步骤，则提高催化剂的吸附能力会增强反应速率。相反，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，则提高催化剂有效移除氢原子的能力会导致更高的丙烯生成速率。

答案：逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附三个步骤。关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的争论影响了对PDH过程的理解，因为它决定了反应的整体效率和动力学。提高催化剂的吸附能力或氢原子移除能力可以增强丙烯生成速率。
