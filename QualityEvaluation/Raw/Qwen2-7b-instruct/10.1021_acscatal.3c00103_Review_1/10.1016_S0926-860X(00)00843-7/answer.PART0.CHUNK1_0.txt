[1] "There are a number of different models of sintering and redispersion which can be classified as empirical, phenomenological, probabilistic, and mechanistic."
[2] "Mechanistically, poisoning is a complex process involving some or all of the following: (a) physical blockage of one or more catalytic sites by the strongly adsorbed poison, (b) electronic modification of nearest neighbor atoms and sometimes even next-nearest neighbor atoms, (c) restructuring of the adsorbent surface, and (d) hindering surface diffusion of adsorbed reactants, thereby preventing reaction."
[3] "For example, hydrothermal degradation of cobalt/alumina and cobalt/silica catalysts to form aluminates and silicates is a serious problem in FT synthesis at the high-pressure, high-conversion conditions typical of commercial operation."
[4] "The ability to quantitatively model at the molecular level (a) poison-surface atom binding energies and effects of poison adsorption on the binding energies of adjacent adsorbed reactants or (b) restructuring of surfaces due to adsorbed poisons is lacking."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption involves the separation of propane into hydrogen and propylene molecules. The β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propylene molecule. Desorption is the release of the resulting propylene molecule. 

Regarding the debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, the literature indicates that there is ongoing uncertainty. The lack of clarity in this matter impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as the precise rate-controlling step determines the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. Without a clear understanding of the rate-controlling step, it is challenging to optimize the PDH process and predict its performance accurately.

This uncertainty underscores the need for further research to elucidate the details of the mechanism and identify the rate-controlling step. This would facilitate the development of more efficient and optimized PDH processes.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解吸附吸附涉及将丙烷分解为氢气和丙烯分子。β-H提取是从丙烯分子中移除一个氢原子。脱附是释放产生的丙烯分子的过程。

关于解吸附吸附或β-H提取是否是速率控制步骤的争论，文献表明存在持续的不确定性。这种不明确性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为确定的速率控制步骤决定了反应的效率和动力学。没有明确理解速率控制步骤，很难优化PDH过程并准确预测其性能。

这种不确定性强调了进一步研究以阐明机制细节并识别速率控制步骤的必要性。这将有助于开发更有效且优化的PDH过程。
