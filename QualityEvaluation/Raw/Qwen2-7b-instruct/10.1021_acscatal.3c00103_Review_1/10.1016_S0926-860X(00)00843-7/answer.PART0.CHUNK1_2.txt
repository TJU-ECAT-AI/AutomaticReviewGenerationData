[1] "There is direct evidence from the previous studies of model-supported catalysts [86] ,[89] for the occurrence of crystallite migration (mainly in well-dispersed systems early in the sintering process), atomic migration (mainly at longer sintering times) and spreading of metal crystallites (mainly in oxygen atmosphere)."
[2] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[3] "There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH."
[4] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact step that governs the reaction rate remains uncertain, leading to ambiguity in understanding the PDH process. This ambiguity affects the theoretical and practical approaches to PDH, necessitating further research to clarify the rate-determining step.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于决定反应速率的步骤仍然存在争议，导致对PDH的理解存在不确定性。这种不确定性影响了PDH的理论和实践方法，需要进一步的研究来澄清决定性步骤。
