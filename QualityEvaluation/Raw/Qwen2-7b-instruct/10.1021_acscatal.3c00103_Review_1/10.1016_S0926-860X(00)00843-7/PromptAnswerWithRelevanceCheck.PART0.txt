[1] "There are a number of different models of sintering and redispersion which can be classified as empirical, phenomenological, probabilistic, and mechanistic."
[2] "Mechanistically, poisoning is a complex process involving some or all of the following: (a) physical blockage of one or more catalytic sites by the strongly adsorbed poison, (b) electronic modification of nearest neighbor atoms and sometimes even next-nearest neighbor atoms, (c) restructuring of the adsorbent surface, and (d) hindering surface diffusion of adsorbed reactants, thereby preventing reaction."
[3] "For example, hydrothermal degradation of cobalt/alumina and cobalt/silica catalysts to form aluminates and silicates is a serious problem in FT synthesis at the high-pressure, high-conversion conditions typical of commercial operation."
[4] "The ability to quantitatively model at the molecular level (a) poison-surface atom binding energies and effects of poison adsorption on the binding energies of adjacent adsorbed reactants or (b) restructuring of surfaces due to adsorbed poisons is lacking."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption involves the separation of propane into hydrogen and propylene molecules. The β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propylene molecule. Desorption is the release of the resulting propylene molecule. 

Regarding the debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, the literature indicates that there is ongoing uncertainty. The lack of clarity in this matter impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as the precise rate-controlling step determines the efficiency and kinetics of the reaction. Without a clear understanding of the rate-controlling step, it is challenging to optimize the PDH process and predict its performance accurately.

This uncertainty underscores the need for further research to elucidate the details of the mechanism and identify the rate-controlling step. This would facilitate the development of more efficient and optimized PDH processes.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解吸附吸附涉及将丙烷分解为氢气和丙烯分子。β-H提取是从丙烯分子中移除一个氢原子。脱附是释放产生的丙烯分子的过程。

关于解吸附吸附或β-H提取是否是速率控制步骤的争论，文献表明存在持续的不确定性。这种不明确性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为确定的速率控制步骤决定了反应的效率和动力学。没有明确理解速率控制步骤，很难优化PDH过程并准确预测其性能。

这种不确定性强调了进一步研究以阐明机制细节并识别速率控制步骤的必要性。这将有助于开发更有效且优化的PDH过程。

[1] "Mechanisms by which a poison may affect catalytic activity are multifold as illustrated by a conceptual two-dimensional model of sulfur poisoning of ethylene hydrogenation on a metal surface shown in Fig. 1 ."
[2] "To begin with, a strongly adsorbed atom of sulfur physically blocks at least one three- or four-fold adsorption/reaction site (projecting into three dimensions) and three or four topside sites on the metal surface."
[3] "Second, by virtue of its strong chemical bond, it electronically modifies its nearest neighbor metal atoms and possibly its next nearest neighbor atoms, thereby modifying their abilities to adsorb and/or dissociate reactant molecules (in this case H2 and ethylene molecules), although these effects do not extend beyond about 5 a.u."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The ways in which a poison can influence catalytic activity are diverse, as exemplified by a conceptual two-dimensional model of sulfur poisoning in ethylene hydrogenation depicted in Figure 1. Initially, a strongly adsorbed sulfur atom physically obstructs at least one three- or four-fold adsorption/reaction site on the metal surface, along with three or four top sites. Secondly, due to its strong chemical bond, sulfur alters the electronic properties of neighboring metal atoms, potentially influencing their capacity to adsorb and/or dissociate reactant molecules (here, hydrogen and ethylene), though these effects do not surpass approximately 5 atomic units.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Carbon can (1) chemisorb strongly as a single layer or physically adsorb in multiple layers, thereby blocking reactants' access to metal surface sites, (2) fully encapsulate a metal particle, rendering it completely inactive, and (3) obstruct micro- and mesopores so that reactants cannot reach many crystallites within these pores. For instance, carbon monoxide (CO) dissociates on metals to form Cα, an adsorbed atomic carbon; Cα can then react to form Cβ, a polymeric carbon film.

[1] "For example, at temperatures below 600 K (1/T>1.66×103 K1) the rate of Cα gasification exceeds that of Cα formation, no carbon is deposited. However above 600 K, Cα accumulates on the surface since the rate of Cα formation exceeds that of Cα gasification."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
For instance, below 600 K (1/T>1.66×103 K1), the rate of Cα gasification is greater than its formation, preventing carbon deposition. Conversely, above 600 K, Cα accumulates on the surface because the rate of Cα formation surpasses its gasification rate.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
例如，在温度低于600 K（1/T>1.66×103 K1）时，Cα的气化速率超过其形成速率，从而阻止了碳沉积。然而，在600 K以上，由于Cα的形成速率超过了其气化速率，因此Cα在表面上积累。

Answer: 
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a theoretical explanation for the process. It comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the propane molecule breaking apart upon contact with the catalyst surface. β-H extraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom from the molecule, resulting in a double bond. Finally, desorption is the release of the newly formed product from the catalyst surface. 

The ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of PDH. If dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, it implies that the reaction is primarily controlled by the efficiency of the adsorption process. Conversely, if β-H extraction is the rate-limiting step, it suggests that the reaction is governed by the rate of hydrogen atom removal. This uncertainty influences the design and optimization of PDH catalysts, as understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for improving catalyst performance and efficiency.

In summary, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism elucidates the sequence of events in PDH, but the debate over the rate-controlling step complicates the precise control and optimization of the process.

回答：丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是一个理论解释，包括三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解吸附吸附涉及丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时断裂。β-H提取指的是从分子中移除一个氢原子，形成双键。最后，脱附是产物从催化剂表面释放的过程。

PDH过程中解吸附吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH的理解。如果解吸附吸附是控制步骤，这表明反应主要由吸附过程的效率决定。相反，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，则表明反应受氢原子去除速率的控制。这种不确定性影响了PDH催化剂的设计和优化，因为理解控制步骤对于改进催化剂性能和效率至关重要。

简而言之，逆霍里图-波兰尼机制揭示了PDH的事件序列，但关于控制步骤的争论复杂化了过程的精确控制和优化。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. During dissociative adsorption, propane molecules are broken down into individual atoms or molecules on the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the resulting alkene or alkene molecule. Desorption is the final step, where the dehydrogenated products leave the catalyst surface. The debate around which step is rate-controlling is due to the intricate interplay between these processes. The uncertainty impacts our understanding of PDH by highlighting the complexity of surface reactions and the need for precise control over reaction conditions to optimize efficiency and selectivity.
