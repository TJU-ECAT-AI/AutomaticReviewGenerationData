Answer: 
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a theoretical explanation for the process. It comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the propane molecule breaking apart upon contact with the catalyst surface. β-H extraction refers to the removal of a hydrogen atom from the molecule, resulting in a double bond. Finally, desorption is the release of the newly formed product from the catalyst surface. 

The ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of PDH. If dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, it implies that the reaction is primarily controlled by the efficiency of the adsorption process. Conversely, if β-H extraction is the rate-limiting step, it suggests that the reaction is governed by the rate of hydrogen atom removal. This uncertainty influences the design and optimization of PDH catalysts, as understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for improving catalyst performance and efficiency.

In summary, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism elucidates the sequence of events in PDH, but the debate over the rate-controlling step complicates the precise control and optimization of the process.

回答：丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是一个理论解释，包括三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解吸附吸附涉及丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时断裂。β-H提取指的是从分子中移除一个氢原子，形成双键。最后，脱附是产物从催化剂表面释放的过程。

PDH过程中解吸附吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH的理解。如果解吸附吸附是控制步骤，这表明反应主要由吸附过程的效率决定。相反，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，则表明反应受氢原子去除速率的控制。这种不确定性影响了PDH催化剂的设计和优化，因为理解控制步骤对于改进催化剂性能和效率至关重要。

简而言之，逆霍里图-波兰尼机制揭示了PDH的事件序列，但关于控制步骤的争论复杂化了过程的精确控制和优化。
