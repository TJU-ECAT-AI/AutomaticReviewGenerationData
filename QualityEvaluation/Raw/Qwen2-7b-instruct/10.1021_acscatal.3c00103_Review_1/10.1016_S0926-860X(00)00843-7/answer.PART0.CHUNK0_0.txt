Deactivation mechanisms of catalysts are comprehensively reviewed in the literature. It summarizes the current understanding and identifies areas needing further investigation for each type of deactivation mechanism. Advancements in surface spectroscopy and computational technologies over the past two decades have enhanced our ability to comprehend deactivation mechanisms and construct models for catalyst design and optimization.

[1] "Mechanisms by which a poison may affect catalytic activity are multifold as illustrated by a conceptual two-dimensional model of sulfur poisoning of ethylene hydrogenation on a metal surface shown in Fig. 1 ."
[2] "To begin with, a strongly adsorbed atom of sulfur physically blocks at least one three- or four-fold adsorption/reaction site (projecting into three dimensions) and three or four topside sites on the metal surface."
[3] "Second, by virtue of its strong chemical bond, it electronically modifies its nearest neighbor metal atoms and possibly its next nearest neighbor atoms, thereby modifying their abilities to adsorb and/or dissociate reactant molecules (in this case H2 and ethylene molecules), although these effects do not extend beyond about 5 a.u."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The ways in which a poison can influence catalytic activity are diverse, as exemplified by a conceptual two-dimensional model of sulfur poisoning in ethylene hydrogenation depicted in Figure 1. Initially, a strongly adsorbed sulfur atom physically obstructs at least one three- or four-fold adsorption/reaction site on the metal surface, along with three or four top sites. Secondly, due to its strong chemical bond, sulfur alters the electronic properties of neighboring metal atoms, potentially influencing their capacity to adsorb and/or dissociate reactant molecules (here, hydrogen and ethylene), though these effects do not surpass approximately 5 atomic units.

毒剂影响催化活性的方式多种多样，如图1所示，通过硫在金属表面氢化乙烯中毒的二维概念模型进行说明。首先，一个强吸附的硫原子物理上阻塞至少一个三或四个吸附/反应位点（三维投影）以及金属表面的三个或四个顶部位点。其次，由于其强大的化学键，硫改变相邻金属原子的电子性质，可能影响它们吸附和/或解离反应分子的能力（在此情况下为氢和乙烷分子），这些效应通常不超过大约5个原子单位。

[1] "Carbon may (1) chemisorb strongly as a monolayer or physically adsorb in multilayers and in either case block access of reactants to metal surface sites, (2) totally encapsulate a metal particle and thereby completely deactivate that particle, and (3) plug micro- and mesopores such that access of reactants is denied to many crystallites inside these pores."
[2] "For example, CO dissociates on metals to form Cα, an adsorbed atomic carbon; Cα can react to Cβ, a polymeric carbon film."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Carbon can (1) chemisorb strongly as a single layer or physically adsorb in multiple layers, thereby blocking reactants' access to metal surface sites, (2) fully encapsulate a metal particle, rendering it completely inactive, and (3) obstruct micro- and mesopores so that reactants cannot reach many crystallites within these pores. For instance, carbon monoxide (CO) dissociates on metals to form Cα, an adsorbed atomic carbon; Cα can then react to form Cβ, a polymeric carbon film.

碳可以（1）以单层强吸附或物理吸附在多层中，从而阻止反应物到达金属表面位点，（2）完全包覆金属颗粒，使其完全失效，以及（3）堵塞微孔和介孔，使反应物无法到达这些孔内部的许多晶粒。例如，一氧化碳（CO）在金属上分解形成Cα，一个吸附的原子碳；Cα可以进一步反应形成Cβ，一个聚集体碳膜。

[1] "For example, at temperatures below 600 K (1/T>1.66×103 K1) the rate of Cα gasification exceeds that of Cα formation, no carbon is deposited. However above 600 K, Cα accumulates on the surface since the rate of Cα formation exceeds that of Cα gasification."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
For instance, below 600 K (1/T>1.66×103 K1), the rate of Cα gasification is greater than its formation, preventing carbon deposition. Conversely, above 600 K, Cα accumulates on the surface because the rate of Cα formation surpasses its gasification rate.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
例如，在温度低于600 K（1/T>1.66×103 K1）时，Cα的气化速率超过其形成速率，从而阻止了碳沉积。然而，在600 K以上，由于Cα的形成速率超过了其气化速率，因此Cα在表面上积累。

Fuentes [90] and Bartholomew and colleagues [85] - [88] have demonstrated that the effects of temperature, atmosphere, metal, promoter, and support can be quantitatively assessed by fitting sintering kinetics data to the general power law expression (GPLE) (2). This expression incorporates a term Deq/D0 to address the observed tendency of the typical dispersion over time curve to approach a limiting dispersion Deq indefinitely. The sintering order, m, is determined to be either 1 or 2.
