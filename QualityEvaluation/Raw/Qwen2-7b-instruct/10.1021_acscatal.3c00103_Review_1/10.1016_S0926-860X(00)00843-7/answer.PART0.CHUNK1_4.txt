[1] "Mechanical stresses leading to fracture or erosion in fluidized or slurry beds may result from (1) collisions of particles with each other or with reactor walls or (2) shear forces created by turbulent eddies or collapsing bubbles (cavitation) at high fluid velocities."
[2] "There are a number of different models of sintering and redispersion which can be classified as empirical, phenomenological, probabilistic, and mechanistic."
[3] "Sintering processes generally take place at high reaction temperatures (e.g. >500C) and are generally accelerated by the presence of water vapor."
[4] "The ability of a material to resist fracture is termed fracture toughness."
[5] "Agglomerate strength would depend greatly on the preparation of the compact."
[6] "The mechanism by which attrition occurs (erosion or fracture) can vary with catalyst or support preparation, crush strength and with reactor environment; it can also vary with the mechanical test method."
[7] "While realistic lab-scale tests have been developed for simulating attrition in large moving-bed and fluidized-bed reactors, no such laboratory test has been developed and demonstrated yet for simulation of large-scale SBCR reactors."

1. Fracture and erosion in fluidized or slurry beds can occur due to collisions of particles with each other or reactor walls, or shear forces from turbulent eddies or collapsing bubbles at high fluid velocities.
2. Models of sintering and redispersion fall into categories such as empirical, phenomenological, probabilistic, and mechanistic.
3. Sintering processes typically occur at high temperatures, often over 500°C, and are sped up by the presence of water vapor.
4. The toughness of a material's ability to resist fracture is a measure of its fracture toughness.
5. The strength of agglomerates depends largely on the method of compact preparation.
6. The mechanism of attrition (erosion or fracture) can differ based on catalyst or support preparation, crush strength, and reactor environment, as well as the mechanical test method used.
7. While laboratory tests have been developed for simulating attrition in large moving-bed and fluidized-bed reactors, no equivalent test exists yet for simulating large-scale SBCR reactors.

1. 在流化床或悬浮床中，裂纹和磨损可能由颗粒之间的碰撞或与反应器壁的碰撞引起，或者由高流速下湍流涡旋或气泡塌陷产生的剪切力引起。
2. 烧结和再分散的过程可以分为经验型、现象学型、概率型和机制型模型。
3. 烧结过程通常在高温下进行，例如超过500°C，并且水蒸气的存在会加速这一过程。
4. 材料抵抗断裂的能力被称作其断裂韧度。
5. 结合体的强度很大程度上取决于结合体的准备方法。
6. 磨损（侵蚀或断裂）的机制可以根据催化剂或支撑材料的准备、破碎强度以及反应器环境的不同而不同，也依赖于所使用的机械测试方法。
7. 虽然已经开发出模拟大型移动床和流化床反应器磨损的实验室测试，但对于模拟大型SBCR反应器来说，尚没有相应的实验室测试方法。
