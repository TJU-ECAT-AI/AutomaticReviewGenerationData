The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. During dissociative adsorption, propane molecules are broken down into individual atoms or molecules on the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the resulting alkene or alkene molecule. Desorption is the final step, where the dehydrogenated products leave the catalyst surface. The debate around which step is rate-controlling is due to the intricate interplay between these processes. The uncertainty impacts our understanding of PDH by highlighting the complexity of surface reactions and the need for precise control over reaction conditions to optimize efficiency and selectivity.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个关键步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。在解离吸附阶段，丙烷分子在催化剂表面上被分解为原子或分子。β-H提取步骤涉及从形成的烯烃或烯烃分子中移除一个氢原子。脱附是最后一步，脱氢产物从催化剂表面离开。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论是因为这些过程之间的复杂相互作用。不确定性影响我们对PDH的理解，突出了表面反应的复杂性以及优化效率和选择性的需要。
