<p>It should be emphasized, that some forms of carbon result in loss of catalytic activity and some do not.</p>
<p>Deactivation of steam reforming catalysts at high reaction temperatures (500900C) may be caused by precipitation of atomic (carbidic) carbon dissolved in the Ni-surface layers to a depth of more than 5070 nm.</p>
<p>The rate at which a carbon or coke is accumulated in a given reaction under given conditions can vary significantly with catalyst structure, including metal type, metal crystallite size, promoter, and catalyst support.</p>
<p>Carbon may (1) chemisorb strongly as a monolayer or physically adsorb in multilayers and in either case block access of reactants to metal surface sites, (2) totally encapsulate a metal particle and thereby completely deactivate that particle, and (3) plug micro- and mesopores such that access of reactants is denied to many crystallites inside these pores.</p>
<p>Crystallite migration involves the migration of entire crystallites over the support surface followed by collision and coalescence. Atomic migration involves detachment of metal atoms from crystallites, migration of these atoms over the support surface and ultimately, capture by larger crystallites.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a complex process involving three key steps. First, dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface occurs. Next, β-H extraction takes place, removing a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule. Finally, the resulting species is desorbed from the surface. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step is ongoing due to uncertainties in the mechanism. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the need for further research to clarify the precise sequence and kinetics of these steps. The exact order of these steps can influence the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction, making it crucial to determine the rate-controlling step to optimize the process.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是一个复杂的过程，涉及三个关键步骤。首先，丙烷分子在催化剂表面进行离解吸附。接着，进行β-H提取，从丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子。最后，生成物从表面脱附。关于是离解吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论正在进行，因为对此机制的不确定性。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它强调了需要进一步研究以澄清这些步骤的确切顺序和动力学的必要性。这些步骤的精确顺序可以影响PDH反应的效率和选择性，因此确定速率控制步骤对于优化过程至关重要。
