The CoSiBeta catalysts are highly effective for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, showing state-of-the-art productivity. These catalysts, whether pre-reduced or not, demonstrate comparable catalytic performance. The CoOx species confined within the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles, which are actively involved in the PDH process.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism suggests that propane molecules dissociate upon adsorption, allowing β-hydrogen extraction, followed by desorption of the resulting olefin. The ongoing debate surrounds whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction step is the rate-limiting factor in the reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the importance of surface chemistry and the role of catalyst structure in controlling reaction kinetics.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over which step is rate-limiting affects our understanding of the PDH process by emphasizing the critical role of surface chemistry and catalyst structure in determining reaction kinetics.
