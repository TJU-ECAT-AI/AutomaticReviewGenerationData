[1] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[2] "The catalytic ability of Co2+ for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
[3] "Metallic Co was considered as the active site for cracking and coking reactions, which are responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[4] "By combining activity test and characterization results, the nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed."
[5] "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption process refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface in a partially dissociated state. The β-H extraction step involves the extraction of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, creating a propylene molecule. The final step is the desorption of the propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate over which of these steps is rate-controlling remains ongoing, impacting our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty around this mechanism affects how we optimize the catalysts and operating conditions for PDH reactions.

逆霍里图-波纳尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关键步骤，包括吸附、β-H提取和脱附三个主要过程。吸附过程是指丙烷分子以部分离解状态吸附到催化剂表面。β-H提取步骤涉及从吸附的丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子，形成丙烯分子。最后一步是从催化剂表面脱附丙烯分子。关于哪一步是决定性的步骤的争论仍在继续，这影响着我们对PDH过程的理解。对这一机制的不确定性影响了我们如何优化催化剂和操作条件以进行PDH反应。
