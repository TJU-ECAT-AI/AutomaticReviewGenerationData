• "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
• "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
• "The 57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity were achieved over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst after prereduction treatment at 600 C, and this catalyst exhibited superior reuse performance with the removal of coke by facile calcination."
• "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact role of each step in the mechanism is a subject of ongoing debate. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-limiting step, while others suggest that the β-H extraction plays a more critical role. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process. The literature does not directly address the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the debate around the rate-controlling step. However, it highlights the use of cobalt catalysts in the PDH process and their ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. The presence of CoOx species confined in the SiBeta zeolite and their reduction to metallic Co particles during the reaction are discussed, but these do not directly relate to the mechanism or the debate about the rate-controlling step in PDH.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及丙烷脱氢（PDH）的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。机制中每个步骤的作用是一个持续争议的话题。一些研究人员认为解离吸附过程是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为β-H提取扮演着更为关键的角色。这种不确定性使我们对PDH过程的理解变得复杂。文献没有直接讨论反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制或关于PDH过程速率控制步骤的争论。然而，它强调了在PDH过程中使用钴催化剂的能力，并实现了高丙烯选择性。在SiBeta沸石中存在CoOx物种及其在反应过程中被还原为金属Co颗粒的事实被讨论，但这与机制或关于PDH过程速率控制步骤的争论并不直接相关。

The CoSiBeta catalysts are highly effective for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, showing state-of-the-art productivity. These catalysts, whether pre-reduced or not, demonstrate comparable catalytic performance. The CoOx species confined within the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles, which are actively involved in the PDH process.

CoSiBeta催化剂对于丙烷直接脱氢成丙烯具有极高的活性和选择性。这些催化剂，无论是否预还原，都表现出相似的催化性能。在SiBeta的硅烷醇中被限制的CoOx物种可以被还原为小颗粒金属Co，这些颗粒在PDH过程中起着催化作用。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism suggests that propane molecules dissociate upon adsorption, allowing β-hydrogen extraction, followed by desorption of the resulting olefin. The ongoing debate surrounds whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction step is the rate-limiting factor in the reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the importance of surface chemistry and the role of catalyst structure in controlling reaction kinetics.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over which step is rate-limiting affects our understanding of the PDH process by emphasizing the critical role of surface chemistry and catalyst structure in determining reaction kinetics.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface in a partially dissociated state. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propane molecule, typically from the β-position of the propane ring. Desorption is the final step where the resulting propylene molecule is released from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-limiting process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the importance of the surface chemistry and structure of the catalyst in controlling the reaction kinetics. The precise role of the catalyst surface in facilitating these steps is crucial for optimizing the efficiency and selectivity of PDH catalysts. The discovery of small confined Co particles as active sites in the PDH process offers new insights into the catalytic mechanism, particularly in terms of how the size of metallic Co particles affects the reaction outcome. Smaller Co particles are found to enhance propylene selectivity by potentially promoting propylene desorption, indicating a structure-sensitive nature of the PDH reaction.

逆霍里图-波兰斯基机制（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指丙烷分子以部分解离的状态吸附到催化剂表面的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从丙烷分子的β位置去除一个氢原子，通常是丙烷环上的氢原子。脱附是最后一步，即将生成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放出来。关于PDH过程中的速率控制步骤的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取是否是速率限制步骤。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，强调了催化剂表面化学和结构在控制反应动力学中的重要性。精确理解催化剂表面如何促进这些步骤对于优化PDH催化剂的效率和选择性至关重要。发现小而受限的Co粒子作为活性位点为PDH过程提供了新的见解，特别是在金属Co颗粒尺寸如何影响反应结果方面。较小的Co颗粒被发现通过可能促进丙烯脱附来增强丙烯选择性，这表明PDH反应具有结构敏感性质。这一发现揭示了在催化机制中，金属Co颗粒尺寸如何影响反应产物的选择性和产率的重要性。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption process refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface in a partially dissociated state. The β-H extraction step involves the extraction of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, creating a propylene molecule. The final step is the desorption of the propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate over which of these steps is rate-controlling remains ongoing, impacting our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty around this mechanism affects how we optimize the catalysts and operating conditions for PDH reactions.
