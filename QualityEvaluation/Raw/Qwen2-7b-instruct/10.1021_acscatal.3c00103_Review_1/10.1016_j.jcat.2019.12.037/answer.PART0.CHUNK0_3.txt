Ultrasmall Co confined in the silanols of dealuminated beta zeolite: A highly active and selective catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene Highlights • CoSiBeta catalysts have state-of-the-art productivity for direct dehydrogenation of propane. • CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance. • The CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles. • The confined small metallic Co particles are catalytically active for PDH.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty regarding which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process, potentially influencing catalyst design and optimization.
