• "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
• "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
• "The 57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity were achieved over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst after prereduction treatment at 600 C, and this catalyst exhibited superior reuse performance with the removal of coke by facile calcination."
• "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact role of each step in the mechanism is a subject of ongoing debate. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-limiting step, while others suggest that the β-H extraction plays a more critical role. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process. The literature does not directly address the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the debate around the rate-controlling step. However, it highlights the use of cobalt catalysts in the PDH process and their ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. The presence of CoOx species confined in the SiBeta zeolite and their reduction to metallic Co particles during the reaction are discussed, but these do not directly relate to the mechanism or the debate about the rate-controlling step in PDH.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及丙烷脱氢（PDH）的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。机制中每个步骤的作用是一个持续争议的话题。一些研究人员认为解离吸附过程是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为β-H提取扮演着更为关键的角色。这种不确定性使我们对PDH过程的理解变得复杂。文献没有直接讨论反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制或关于PDH过程速率控制步骤的争论。然而，它强调了在PDH过程中使用钴催化剂的能力，并实现了高丙烯选择性。在SiBeta沸石中存在CoOx物种及其在反应过程中被还原为金属Co颗粒的事实被讨论，但这与机制或关于PDH过程速率控制步骤的争论并不直接相关。
