[1] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[2] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
[3] "This work proves the high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles, as well as providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, eco-friendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH."
[4] "The 57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity were achieved over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst after prereduction treatment at 600 C, and this catalyst exhibited superior reuse performance with the removal of coke by facile calcination."
[5] "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."
[6] "Also, the PDH reaction over the metallic Co is likely a structure-sensitive reaction, the target reactivity of which seems to be determined by the metallic Co sizes: small metallic Co leads to high propylene selectivity, possibly by boosting propylene desorption."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface in a partially dissociated state. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propane molecule, typically from the β-position of the propane ring. Desorption is the final step where the resulting propylene molecule is released from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-limiting process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the importance of the surface chemistry and structure of the catalyst in controlling the reaction kinetics. The precise role of the catalyst surface in facilitating these steps is crucial for optimizing the efficiency and selectivity of PDH catalysts. The discovery of small confined Co particles as active sites in the PDH process offers new insights into the catalytic mechanism, particularly in terms of how the size of metallic Co particles affects the reaction outcome. Smaller Co particles are found to enhance propylene selectivity by potentially promoting propylene desorption, indicating a structure-sensitive nature of the PDH reaction.

逆霍里图-波兰斯基机制（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指丙烷分子以部分解离的状态吸附到催化剂表面的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从丙烷分子的β位置去除一个氢原子，通常是丙烷环上的氢原子。脱附是最后一步，即将生成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放出来。关于PDH过程中的速率控制步骤的争论集中在解离吸附或β-H提取是否是速率限制步骤。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，强调了催化剂表面化学和结构在控制反应动力学中的重要性。精确理解催化剂表面如何促进这些步骤对于优化PDH催化剂的效率和选择性至关重要。发现小而受限的Co粒子作为活性位点为PDH过程提供了新的见解，特别是在金属Co颗粒尺寸如何影响反应结果方面。较小的Co颗粒被发现通过可能促进丙烯脱附来增强丙烯选择性，这表明PDH反应具有结构敏感性质。这一发现揭示了在催化机制中，金属Co颗粒尺寸如何影响反应产物的选择性和产率的重要性。
