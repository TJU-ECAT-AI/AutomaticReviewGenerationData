[1] "Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
[2] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."
[3] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion."
[4] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation. We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[5] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The process begins with the dissociative adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface. The second step involves the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H) from the adsorbed propane molecule. Finally, the adsorbed alkene molecule is desorbed from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty in this area complicates the optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里图-波纳尼机制包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该过程以丙烷在催化剂表面的解离吸附开始。第二步涉及从吸附的丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子（β-H）。最后，吸附的烯烃分子从催化剂表面脱附。关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这一领域的不确定性使催化剂优化和反应条件优化变得复杂。
