<p>The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen [54] .</p>
<p>In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen [55] compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O. The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage.</p>
<p>A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations [56] .</p>
<p>High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart [53] .</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves two platinum atoms and is the rate-limiting step. The β-H extraction is followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule. The debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the process. This uncertainty complicates the optimization of catalyst performance and selectivity in PDH reactions. The elucidation of the rate-controlling step would guide the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions for PDH.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiiuti-Polanyi机制包含三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及两个铂原子，是限速步骤。β-H提取后，烯烃被释放，氢原子重新组合并以氢分子形式脱附。关于PDH中是否是解离吸附或β-H提取是决定性步骤的争议影响了我们对这一过程的理解。这一不确定性使优化催化剂性能和选择性变得复杂。明确决定性步骤将指导开发更高效的催化剂和反应条件。
