The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The process begins with the dissociative adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface. The second step involves the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H) from the adsorbed propane molecule. Finally, the adsorbed alkene molecule is desorbed from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty in this area complicates the optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves two platinum atoms and is the rate-limiting step. The β-H extraction is followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule. The debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the process. This uncertainty complicates the optimization of catalyst performance and selectivity in PDH reactions. The elucidation of the rate-controlling step would guide the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions for PDH.

[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."
[2] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[3] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
[4] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
[5] "There are reported density functional theory (DFT) calculations, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and spectroscopic evidences that support an electronic interaction between platinum and tin."
[6] "Sequential impregnation with tin added first results in a strong interaction with the support material, and the tin-support material interaction can influence the surface acidity of the catalyst."
[7] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
[8] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps:

1. **Dissociative Adsorption**: The propane molecule is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface in a manner that breaks the C-H bonds, allowing for the formation of a hydrogen atom and an alkyl group.

2. **β-H Extraction**: The hydrogen atom is extracted from the alkyl group through a β-H elimination process, resulting in the formation of an alkene.

3. **Desorption**: The alkene is then desorbed from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

Regarding the debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH, the uncertainty arises from the complexity of the mechanism and the difficulty in accurately determining which step limits the overall reaction rate. The rate of dissociative adsorption is influenced by factors such as the strength of the adsorption energy and the stability of the adsorbed species. On the other hand, the rate of β-H extraction depends on the ease of hydrogen abstraction and the stability of the resulting alkene species.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the specific conditions under which each step is rate-limiting. Understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for optimizing the catalyst design and reaction conditions to enhance the efficiency of the PDH process.

The ongoing debate emphasizes the importance of considering kinetic and thermodynamic factors that govern each step of the mechanism. It suggests that achieving a more precise control over the PDH process might require developing catalysts with tailored properties that optimize both adsorption and hydrogen abstraction rates. Additionally, the investigation of the role of surface species and their interactions with the propane molecule could provide insights into the mechanism and potentially guide the development of more effective PDH catalysts.

In summary, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption steps. The debate over which step is rate-controlling adds to the complexity of the process and underscores the need for further research to optimize the PDH process for industrial applications.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three sequential steps:

1. **Dissociative Adsorption**: Propane molecules are absorbed onto the surface of the catalyst in a manner that breaks the CH bonds, leading to the formation of a dissociated propane complex.

2. **β-H Extraction**: The hydrogen atom (β-H) is extracted from the adsorbed propane complex, typically from the methyl group (CH3) bonded to the central carbon atom of the propane molecule.

3. **Desorption**: The resulting propene molecule is released from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

The ongoing debate about which of these steps is the rate-limiting factor in PDH complicates the design and optimization of catalysts and operational parameters for achieving high efficiency and selectivity. This uncertainty necessitates further research to elucidate the precise kinetics and mechanisms involved in each step, thereby guiding the development of more effective catalysts and process conditions.

<p>Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.</p>
<p>The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding.</p>
<p>Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity.</p>
<p>Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not explicitly discuss the rate-controlling step between these three processes. However, it does suggest that the stability of the catalyst and the incorporation of a redox-active adatom in a zeolite framework can enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the need for further investigation into the rate-controlling step. The autothermal dehydrogenation approach aims to reduce the energy input required for dehydrogenation but faces challenges due to complex reactor design and operational requirements. VOx-based catalysts, especially those with specific phases, show promise for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase significantly influences catalyst performance. In contrast, NiOx, Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts demonstrate electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The electrophilic mechanism occurs in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while the nucleophilic mechanism is observed in catalysts containing halide ions or Li doping.

The uncertainty around the rate-controlling step in PDH and the complexity of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach highlight areas that require further research. The promise of VOx-based catalysts and the identification of active sites in NiOx, Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts offer potential solutions to improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。文献没有明确讨论这三个过程中的速率控制步骤。然而，它确实建议通过Lewis基辅助去质子化机制增强催化剂稳定性并利用红氧化合物在沸石框架中的集成可以增强CH活化活性。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它强调了需要进一步研究确定速率控制步骤的必要性。自动热脱氢方法旨在降低脱氢所需的能量输入，但由于复杂的反应器设计和操作要求，这种方法受到行业较少青睐。基于VOx的催化剂，特别是具有特定相位的催化剂，在氧化脱氢C3烷烃方面显示出潜力。催化剂相态显著影响催化剂性能。相比之下，NiOx、Li掺杂MgO和卤素包含催化剂显示出亲电性和亲核性CH活化机制。在NiOLiCl/SZ催化剂中观察到亲电机制，而在含卤素离子或Li掺杂的催化剂中观察到亲核机制。

PDH过程中的速率控制步骤的不确定性以及自动热脱氢方法的复杂性突出了需要进一步研究的领域。基于VOx的催化剂和在NiOx、Li掺杂MgO和卤素包含催化剂中识别活性位点提供了解决脱氢过程效率问题的潜在解决方案。
