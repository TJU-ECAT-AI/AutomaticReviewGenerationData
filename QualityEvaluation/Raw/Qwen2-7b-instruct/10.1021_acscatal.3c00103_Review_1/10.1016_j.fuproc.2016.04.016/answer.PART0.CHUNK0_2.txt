[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."
[2] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[3] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
[4] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
[5] "There are reported density functional theory (DFT) calculations, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and spectroscopic evidences that support an electronic interaction between platinum and tin."
[6] "Sequential impregnation with tin added first results in a strong interaction with the support material, and the tin-support material interaction can influence the surface acidity of the catalyst."
[7] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
[8] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps:

1. **Dissociative Adsorption**: The propane molecule is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface in a manner that breaks the C-H bonds, allowing for the formation of a hydrogen atom and an alkyl group.

2. **β-H Extraction**: The hydrogen atom is extracted from the alkyl group through a β-H elimination process, resulting in the formation of an alkene.

3. **Desorption**: The alkene is then desorbed from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

Regarding the debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH, the uncertainty arises from the complexity of the mechanism and the difficulty in accurately determining which step limits the overall reaction rate. The rate of dissociative adsorption is influenced by factors such as the strength of the adsorption energy and the stability of the adsorbed species. On the other hand, the rate of β-H extraction depends on the ease of hydrogen abstraction and the stability of the resulting alkene species.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the specific conditions under which each step is rate-limiting. Understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for optimizing the catalyst design and reaction conditions to enhance the efficiency of the PDH process.

The ongoing debate emphasizes the importance of considering kinetic and thermodynamic factors that govern each step of the mechanism. It suggests that achieving a more precise control over the PDH process might require developing catalysts with tailored properties that optimize both adsorption and hydrogen abstraction rates. Additionally, the investigation of the role of surface species and their interactions with the propane molecule could provide insights into the mechanism and potentially guide the development of more effective PDH catalysts.

In summary, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption steps. The debate over which step is rate-controlling adds to the complexity of the process and underscores the need for further research to optimize the PDH process for industrial applications.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的逆向过程，包括三个连续步骤：

1. **离解吸附**：丙烷分子在催化剂表面以断开C-H键的方式被吸附，形成一个氢原子和一个烷基团。

2. **β-H提取**：从烷基团中提取氢原子，通过β-H消除过程，产生一种烯烃。

3. **脱附**：然后将烯烃从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

关于在PDH中哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论，其不确定性源自机制的复杂性和确定哪个步骤限制总体反应速率的困难。离解吸附的速度受到吸附能强度和吸附物种稳定性等因素的影响。另一方面，β-H提取的速度依赖于氢抽象的容易程度和生成的烯烃物种的稳定性。

这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，表明需要进一步研究来阐明每一步何时成为速率限制步骤。理解速率控制步骤对于优化催化剂设计和反应条件以提高PDH过程的效率至关重要。

持续的争论强调了考虑控制每个步骤的热力学和动力学因素的重要性。它表明，为了实现PDH过程的更精确控制，可能需要开发具有定制属性的催化剂，以优化吸附和氢提取速率。此外，研究表面物种及其与丙烷分子的相互作用，可以为机制提供见解，并有可能指导PDH催化剂的开发。

总之，PDH的反霍里图-波兰尼机制涉及离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附步骤。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论增加了过程的复杂性，并强调了进一步研究以优化PDH过程用于工业应用的必要性。
