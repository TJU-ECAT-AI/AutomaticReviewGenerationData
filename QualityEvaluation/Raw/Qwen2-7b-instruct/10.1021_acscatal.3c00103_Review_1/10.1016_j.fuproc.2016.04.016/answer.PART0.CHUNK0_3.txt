Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three steps:
1. Dissociative adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface.
2. β-H extraction from the adsorbed propane molecule.
3. Desorption of the resulting propene molecule from the catalyst surface.

The uncertainty regarding which step is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the optimization of catalysts and operating conditions for maximum efficiency and selectivity.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three sequential steps:

1. **Dissociative Adsorption**: Propane molecules are absorbed onto the surface of the catalyst in a manner that breaks the CH bonds, leading to the formation of a dissociated propane complex.

2. **β-H Extraction**: The hydrogen atom (β-H) is extracted from the adsorbed propane complex, typically from the methyl group (CH3) bonded to the central carbon atom of the propane molecule.

3. **Desorption**: The resulting propene molecule is released from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

The ongoing debate about which of these steps is the rate-limiting factor in PDH complicates the design and optimization of catalysts and operational parameters for achieving high efficiency and selectivity. This uncertainty necessitates further research to elucidate the precise kinetics and mechanisms involved in each step, thereby guiding the development of more effective catalysts and process conditions.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里图-波兰尼机制包含三个连续步骤：

1. **解离吸附**：丙烷分子在催化剂表面以破坏CH键的方式被吸附，形成一个解离的丙烷复合物。

2. **β-H提取**：从吸附的丙烷复合物中提取氢原子（β-H），通常是从连接到丙烷分子中央碳原子的甲基（CH3）。

3. **脱附**：生成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放出来，完成脱氢过程。

关于这些步骤中哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论，使得对PDH过程的理解复杂化，因为这影响着催化剂设计和操作条件的优化以实现高效率和选择性。这种不确定性需要进一步研究来阐明每个步骤的确切动力学和机制，从而指导更有效的催化剂和工艺条件的发展。
