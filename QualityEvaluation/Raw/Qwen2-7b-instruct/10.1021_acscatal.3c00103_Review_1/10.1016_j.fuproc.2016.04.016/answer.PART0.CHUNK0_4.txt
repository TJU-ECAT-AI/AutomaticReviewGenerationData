<p>Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.</p>
<p>The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding.</p>
<p>Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity.</p>
<p>Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not explicitly discuss the rate-controlling step between these three processes. However, it does suggest that the stability of the catalyst and the incorporation of a redox-active adatom in a zeolite framework can enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the need for further investigation into the rate-controlling step. The autothermal dehydrogenation approach aims to reduce the energy input required for dehydrogenation but faces challenges due to complex reactor design and operational requirements. VOx-based catalysts, especially those with specific phases, show promise for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase significantly influences catalyst performance. In contrast, NiOx, Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts demonstrate electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The electrophilic mechanism occurs in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while the nucleophilic mechanism is observed in catalysts containing halide ions or Li doping.

The uncertainty around the rate-controlling step in PDH and the complexity of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach highlight areas that require further research. The promise of VOx-based catalysts and the identification of active sites in NiOx, Li-doped MgO, and halide-containing catalysts offer potential solutions to improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。文献没有明确讨论这三个过程中的速率控制步骤。然而，它确实建议通过Lewis基辅助去质子化机制增强催化剂稳定性并利用红氧化合物在沸石框架中的集成可以增强CH活化活性。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它强调了需要进一步研究确定速率控制步骤的必要性。自动热脱氢方法旨在降低脱氢所需的能量输入，但由于复杂的反应器设计和操作要求，这种方法受到行业较少青睐。基于VOx的催化剂，特别是具有特定相位的催化剂，在氧化脱氢C3烷烃方面显示出潜力。催化剂相态显著影响催化剂性能。相比之下，NiOx、Li掺杂MgO和卤素包含催化剂显示出亲电性和亲核性CH活化机制。在NiOLiCl/SZ催化剂中观察到亲电机制，而在含卤素离子或Li掺杂的催化剂中观察到亲核机制。

PDH过程中的速率控制步骤的不确定性以及自动热脱氢方法的复杂性突出了需要进一步研究的领域。基于VOx的催化剂和在NiOx、Li掺杂MgO和卤素包含催化剂中识别活性位点提供了解决脱氢过程效率问题的潜在解决方案。
