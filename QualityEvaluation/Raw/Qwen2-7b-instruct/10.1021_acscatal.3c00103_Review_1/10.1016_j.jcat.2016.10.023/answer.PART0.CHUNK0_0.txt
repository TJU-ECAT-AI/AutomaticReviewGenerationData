[1] "Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments."
[2] "Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes."
[3] "DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process of propane molecules breaking apart upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, forming a carbocation. Desorption is the final step where the resulting species is released from the surface as propylene. The uncertainty regarding which of these steps is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the efficiency of the reaction and the selectivity towards propylene. The precise identification of the rate-determining step is crucial for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design.

逆Horita-Polanyi机制涉及丙烷脱氢化（PDH）的三个步骤：离解吸附，β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附时分解的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从吸附的丙烷分子中抽象出一个氢原子，形成碳正离子。脱附是最后一步，其中产生的物种从表面释放为丙烯。关于这些步骤中哪一个是控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和丙烯的选择性。准确识别决定性步骤对于优化反应条件和催化剂设计至关重要。
