<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a reaction that transforms propane into propylene. It involves three main steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface.</li>
<li>β-H extraction, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule.</li>
<li>Desorption of the resulting propylene molecule from the catalyst surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rate-controlling step in PDH is a matter of ongoing debate. Some studies suggest that dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that β-H extraction might be more critical. The uncertainty around this issue impacts our understanding of the PDH process, influencing the design of catalysts and reaction conditions.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface, β-H extraction from the adsorbed propane molecule, and subsequent desorption of the resulting propylene molecule. There is a debate in the literature about which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty affects our comprehension of the PDH process, guiding the development of catalysts and operational parameters.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horita-Polanyi机制包含三个关键步骤：丙烷分子在催化剂表面的离解吸附、从吸附的丙烷分子中提取β-H以及随后将生成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放。关于这三步中哪一步，离解吸附还是β-H提取，是决定性步骤的争议持续存在。这一不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，指导着催化剂的设计和操作条件的设定。
