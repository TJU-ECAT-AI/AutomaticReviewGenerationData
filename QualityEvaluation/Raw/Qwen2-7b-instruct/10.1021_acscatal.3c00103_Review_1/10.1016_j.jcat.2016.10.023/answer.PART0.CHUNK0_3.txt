[1] "Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments."
[2] "Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes."
[3] "DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption is the process by which propane molecules break apart upon contact with the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step follows, during which a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the propane molecule, leading to the formation of a propylidyne species. Finally, the propylidyne species desorbs from the surface. The ongoing debate is whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Uncertainty in this regard impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the kinetics and mechanism of the reaction. The rate-controlling step determines the overall speed at which the reaction proceeds and influences the efficiency of the process.

逆Horiiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附过程是丙烷分子在催化剂表面断裂的过程。随后进行β-H提取步骤，在此过程中，从丙烷分子中抽取一个氢原子，形成一个丙基二烯物种。最后，丙基二烯物种从表面脱附。关于PDH反应中解离吸附或β-H提取是控制速率的关键步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的热力学和机制。控制速率的步骤决定了反应的总体速度，并影响了过程的效率。
