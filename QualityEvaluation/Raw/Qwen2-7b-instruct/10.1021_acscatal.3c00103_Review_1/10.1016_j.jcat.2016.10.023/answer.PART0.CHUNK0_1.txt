[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a proposed pathway that involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "Critically discussing the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction, it appears that the uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process."
[3] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism suggests that propane molecules first dissociatively adsorb onto the catalyst surface, then undergo β-H extraction to form propylidyne, and finally, the propylidyne is desorbed as propylene."
[4] "The debate about which step controls the reaction rate highlights the complexity of the PDH process. While the dissociative adsorption step is essential for the initiation of the reaction, the β-H extraction step might be the rate-determining step due to its potential to efficiently convert the adsorbed species into the desired product."
[5] "This uncertainty affects our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the most efficient catalysts and reaction conditions. Determining the rate-controlling step can lead to improvements in the design of catalysts and reactors for PDH processes."
