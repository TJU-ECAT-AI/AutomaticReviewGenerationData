[1] "Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments."
[2] "Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes."
[3] "DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites."
[4] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."
[5] "Most of the coke deposits blocking the active sites on small nanoparticles can be removed and a significant portion of the initial catalytic activity can be restored by partial oxidation at relatively mild conditions (up to 700 K), without burning off all of the carbon deposits from larger particles and support."
[6] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."
[7] "The involvement of surface transport can explain the presence of two CO2 peaks that are often observed during TPO experiments with coked metal catalysts. In fact, both of those peaks may contain the coke located on the support material, but some of these coke deposits may be more accessible for the oxidizing species due to additional transport processes on the surface."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This debate affects the interpretation of kinetic data and the development of catalytic models. The involvement of surface transport processes on the support material complicates the characterization of coke deposits' oxidation behavior, making it crucial to consider the interplay between chemical reactions and surface transport mechanisms. Time-resolved kinetic characterization techniques, such as transient absorption spectroscopy or temperature-programmed oxidation, can offer insights into these dynamics by tracking the subtle changes in the system over time.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH is a well-established process that describes the conversion of propane (C3H8) into propylene (C3H6) and hydrogen (H2) through a series of steps. However, the exact sequence of events, particularly the rate-controlling step, remains a topic of ongoing debate among researchers. This uncertainty has implications for the optimization of catalytic processes and the design of efficient catalysts for PDH. The debate centers on the efficiency of dissociative adsorption versus β-H extraction, which are competing pathways for the activation of propane molecules on the catalyst surface.

DFT calculations and experimental observations suggest that the initial stages of coke formation involve the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites towards the sites of graphene assembly. This process is coupled with the restructuring of Pt nanoparticles, which leads to the formation of new active sites. This dynamic interplay between the carbon deposition process and the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst surface is crucial for understanding the overall catalytic activity and selectivity.

The morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits, as observed through TEM, reveals the formation of extended graphene sheets originating from small Pt nanoparticles and spreading onto the support surface. These graphene sheets undergo deformation, forming entangled conglomerates on the support, possibly incorporating carbon nanotubes. The encapsulation of larger Pt nanoparticles with graphitic layers indicates a preference for carbon deposition on these sites. The ability to restore a significant portion of the initial catalytic activity by partial oxidation suggests that the carbon deposits, primarily consisting of graphene, can be selectively removed without compromising the structural integrity of the catalyst.

The oxidation of coke deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts is a complex process influenced by both chemical reactions and surface transport mechanisms. The presence of two CO2 peaks during TPO experiments highlights the importance of considering surface transport processes in understanding the behavior of coke deposits. These peaks may contain coke located on the support material, and the accessibility of these deposits for oxidation depends on additional transport processes on the surface. Time-resolved isothermal oxidation techniques, alongside temperature-resolved oxidation, provide valuable insights into the intricate interactions between chemical reactions and surface transport during the oxidation process.

In summary, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH is a fundamental process in the field of catalysis, and the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step underscores the complexity of the PDH process. The role of surface transport mechanisms in the oxidation of coke deposits further complicates the characterization of these processes. Time-resolved kinetic characterization techniques offer a powerful tool for elucidating the subtle dynamics of surface-mediated reactions, providing insights into the intricate interplay between chemical reactions and surface transport.
