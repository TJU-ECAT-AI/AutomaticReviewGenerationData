[1] "Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments."
[2] "Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes."
[3] "DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process of propane molecules breaking apart upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, forming a carbocation. Desorption is the final step where the resulting species is released from the surface as propylene. The uncertainty regarding which of these steps is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the efficiency of the reaction and the selectivity towards propylene. The precise identification of the rate-determining step is crucial for optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design.

[5] "Most of the coke deposits blocking the active sites on small nanoparticles can be removed and a significant portion of the initial catalytic activity can be restored by partial oxidation at relatively mild conditions (up to 700 K), without burning off all of the carbon deposits from larger particles and support."
[6] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."
[7] "The involvement of surface transport can explain the presence of two CO2 peaks that are often observed during TPO experiments with coked metal catalysts. In fact, both of those peaks may contain the coke located on the support material, but some of these coke deposits may be more accessible for the oxidizing species due to additional transport processes on the surface."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This debate affects the interpretation of kinetic data and the development of catalytic models. The involvement of surface transport processes on the support material complicates the characterization of coke deposits' oxidation behavior, making it crucial to consider the interplay between chemical reactions and surface transport mechanisms. Time-resolved kinetic characterization techniques, such as transient absorption spectroscopy or temperature-programmed oxidation, can offer insights into these dynamics by tracking the subtle changes in the system over time.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH is a well-established process that describes the conversion of propane (C3H8) into propylene (C3H6) and hydrogen (H2) through a series of steps. However, the exact sequence of events, particularly the rate-controlling step, remains a topic of ongoing debate among researchers. This uncertainty has implications for the optimization of catalytic processes and the design of efficient catalysts for PDH. The debate centers on the efficiency of dissociative adsorption versus β-H extraction, which are competing pathways for the activation of propane molecules on the catalyst surface.

DFT calculations and experimental observations suggest that the initial stages of coke formation involve the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites towards the sites of graphene assembly. This process is coupled with the restructuring of Pt nanoparticles, which leads to the formation of new active sites. This dynamic interplay between the carbon deposition process and the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst surface is crucial for understanding the overall catalytic activity and selectivity.

The morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits, as observed through TEM, reveals the formation of extended graphene sheets originating from small Pt nanoparticles and spreading onto the support surface. These graphene sheets undergo deformation, forming entangled conglomerates on the support, possibly incorporating carbon nanotubes. The encapsulation of larger Pt nanoparticles with graphitic layers indicates a preference for carbon deposition on these sites. The ability to restore a significant portion of the initial catalytic activity by partial oxidation suggests that the carbon deposits, primarily consisting of graphene, can be selectively removed without compromising the structural integrity of the catalyst.

The oxidation of coke deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts is a complex process influenced by both chemical reactions and surface transport mechanisms. The presence of two CO2 peaks during TPO experiments highlights the importance of considering surface transport processes in understanding the behavior of coke deposits. These peaks may contain coke located on the support material, and the accessibility of these deposits for oxidation depends on additional transport processes on the surface. Time-resolved isothermal oxidation techniques, alongside temperature-resolved oxidation, provide valuable insights into the intricate interactions between chemical reactions and surface transport during the oxidation process.

In summary, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH is a fundamental process in the field of catalysis, and the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step underscores the complexity of the PDH process. The role of surface transport mechanisms in the oxidation of coke deposits further complicates the characterization of these processes. Time-resolved kinetic characterization techniques offer a powerful tool for elucidating the subtle dynamics of surface-mediated reactions, providing insights into the intricate interplay between chemical reactions and surface transport.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的一个已确立的步骤，涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于解离吸附或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这一辩论对于优化催化过程和设计高效的PDH催化剂具有重要影响。解离吸附与β-H提取之间的效率差异是争论的核心，这影响了动力学数据的解释以及催化模型的发展。

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述了丙烷（C3H8）通过一系列步骤转化为丙烯（C3H6）和氢气（H2）。然而，具体事件的顺序，特别是速率控制步骤，仍然是研究人员讨论的焦点。这场辩论集中在解离吸附与β-H提取这两种激活丙烷分子在催化剂表面的途径的竞争性。

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和实验观察表明，在初始阶段的焦炭形成过程中，焦炭前体从脱氢化位点迁移至石墨烯组装区域。这个过程与铂纳米颗粒的重构相耦合，导致新活性位点的形成。这种在碳沉积过程与催化剂表面物理和化学性质之间动态相互作用对于理解整体催化活性和选择性的关键作用至关重要。

通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）观察到的成熟碳沉积物形态揭示了源自小铂纳米颗粒的延伸石墨烯层，并向支撑表面扩散。这些石墨烯层在支撑表面发生变形，形成缠结的集合体，可能包含碳纳米管。较大铂纳米颗粒被石墨层包覆，表明碳沉积倾向于这些位点。通过部分氧化恢复初始催化活性的大部分说明，主要由石墨组成的碳沉积物可以被选择性地去除，而不会损害催化剂结构完整性。

在Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上焦炭沉积的氧化是一个复杂的过程，受到化学反应和支撑表面传输机制的影响。TPO实验中观察到的两个CO2峰的存在强调了考虑表面传输过程的重要性，以理解焦炭沉积物的行为。这些峰可能包含位于支撑材料上的焦炭，但这些焦炭沉积物的可氧化性取决于表面上的额外传输过程。时间分辨等温氧化技术与温度分辨氧化结合提供了深入了解化学反应和表面传输之间复杂交互的宝贵见解。

综上所述，逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是催化领域的基础过程，关于速率控制步骤的争议凸显了PDH过程的复杂性。表面传输机制在焦炭沉积物氧化过程中的作用进一步复杂化了这些过程的表征。时间分辨的动能表征技术提供了一种强大的工具来阐明表面介导反应的微妙动态，提供了化学反应与表面传输之间微妙互动的深入见解。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption is the process by which propane molecules break apart upon contact with the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step follows, during which a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the propane molecule, leading to the formation of a propylidyne species. Finally, the propylidyne species desorbs from the surface. The ongoing debate is whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Uncertainty in this regard impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the kinetics and mechanism of the reaction. The rate-controlling step determines the overall speed at which the reaction proceeds and influences the efficiency of the process.
