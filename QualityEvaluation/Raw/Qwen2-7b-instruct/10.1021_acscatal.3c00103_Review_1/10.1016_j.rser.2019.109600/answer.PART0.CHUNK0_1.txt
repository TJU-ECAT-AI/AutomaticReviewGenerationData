[1] "However, the catalyst used in the reforming step undergoes a rapid and severe deactivation by means of a series of physicochemical phenomena, including metal sintering, metallic phase oxidation, thermal degradation of the support and, more notoriously, coke deposition."
[2] "An emphasis is placed on coke deposition and its influence on deactivation, which depends on its location, chemical nature, morphology, precursors or formation mechanism, among others."
[3] "We also discuss the challenges for increasing the value of the carbon materials formed and therefore, enhance process viability."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not provide a definitive conclusion on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved and the need for further research to clarify these details. Increasing the value of the carbon materials formed through coke deposition is considered a challenge for enhancing the overall process viability.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献没有明确指出在该反应中，解离吸附过程或β-H提取是控制速率的步骤。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，表明反应机制的复杂性，并强调需要进一步研究来澄清这些细节的必要性。通过增加形成碳材料的价值，尤其是焦炭沉积，被认为是提高整个过程可行性的挑战。
