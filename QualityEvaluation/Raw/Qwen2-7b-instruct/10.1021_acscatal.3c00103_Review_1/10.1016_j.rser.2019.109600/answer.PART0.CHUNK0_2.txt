[1] "The catalyst used in the reforming step undergoes a rapid and severe deactivation by means of a series of physicochemical phenomena, including metal sintering, metallic phase oxidation, thermal degradation of the support and, more notoriously, coke deposition."
[2] "An emphasis is placed on coke deposition and its influence on deactivation, which depends on its location, chemical nature, morphology, precursors or formation mechanism, among others."
[3] "We also discuss the challenges for increasing the value of the carbon materials formed and therefore, enhance process viability."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact sequence of these steps is debated, with uncertainty surrounding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step. This ambiguity impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the development of efficient catalysts and optimization strategies. To address this challenge, researchers aim to increase the value of carbon materials produced through the process, enhancing overall process viability.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。这些步骤的顺序存在争议，不确定解离吸附或β-H提取是否为控制步骤。这种不确定性影响了对PDH过程的理解，因为它使开发高效催化剂和优化策略变得复杂。为了应对这一挑战，研究人员致力于提高通过该过程产生的碳材料的价值，从而增强整个过程的可行性。
