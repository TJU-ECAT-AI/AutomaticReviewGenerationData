[1] "Undoubtedly, hydrogen (H2) is a clean feedstock and energy carrier whose sustainable production should be anticipated."
[2] "The pyrolysis of biomass or waste plastics and the subsequent reforming over base (transition) or noble metals supported catalysts allows reaching elevated H2 yields."
[3] "However, the catalyst used in the reforming step undergoes a rapid and severe deactivation by means of a series of physicochemical phenomena, including metal sintering, metallic phase oxidation, thermal degradation of the support and, more notoriously, coke deposition."
[4] "An emphasis is placed on coke deposition and its influence on deactivation, which depends on its location, chemical nature, morphology, precursors or formation mechanism, among others."
[5] "We also discuss the challenges for increasing the value of the carbon materials formed and therefore, enhance process viability."

Hydrogen production through the pyrolysis of biomass or waste plastics followed by reforming over supported catalysts can yield high amounts of hydrogen. However, this process faces challenges due to catalyst deactivation, particularly through coke deposition. Coke formation affects catalyst performance, and its impact varies based on factors such as location, chemical nature, morphology, precursors, and formation mechanism. The review discusses the difficulties in enhancing the value of carbon materials produced, aiming to improve the overall process viability.
