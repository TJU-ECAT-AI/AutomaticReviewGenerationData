[1] "However, the catalyst used in the reforming step undergoes a rapid and severe deactivation by means of a series of physicochemical phenomena, including metal sintering, metallic phase oxidation, thermal degradation of the support and, more notoriously, coke deposition."
[2] "An emphasis is placed on coke deposition and its influence on deactivation, which depends on its location, chemical nature, morphology, precursors or formation mechanism, among others."
[3] "We also discuss the challenges for increasing the value of the carbon materials formed and therefore, enhance process viability."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate around this mechanism centers on the rate-controlling step, with both dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction being considered as potential candidates. The uncertainty surrounding this mechanism impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and product selectivity. To address these challenges, researchers are focusing on enhancing the value of carbon materials produced as a byproduct, aiming to improve the overall process viability. This involves optimizing the catalyst design, reactor operation, and post-processing techniques to mitigate deactivation mechanisms and maximize the yield and quality of hydrogen and other valuable products.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not provide a definitive conclusion on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved and the need for further research to clarify these details. Increasing the value of the carbon materials formed through coke deposition is considered a challenge for enhancing the overall process viability.

Hydrogen production through the pyrolysis of biomass or waste plastics followed by reforming over supported catalysts can yield high amounts of hydrogen. However, this process faces challenges due to catalyst deactivation, particularly through coke deposition. Coke formation affects catalyst performance, and its impact varies based on factors such as location, chemical nature, morphology, precursors, and formation mechanism. The review discusses the difficulties in enhancing the value of carbon materials produced, aiming to improve the overall process viability.
