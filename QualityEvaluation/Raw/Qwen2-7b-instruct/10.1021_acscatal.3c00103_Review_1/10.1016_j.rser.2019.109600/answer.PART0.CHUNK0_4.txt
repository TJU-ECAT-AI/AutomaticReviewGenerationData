[1] "Undoubtedly, hydrogen (H2) is a clean feedstock and energy carrier whose sustainable production should be anticipated."
[2] "The pyrolysis of biomass or waste plastics and the subsequent reforming over base (transition) or noble metals supported catalysts allows reaching elevated H2 yields."
[3] "However, the catalyst used in the reforming step undergoes a rapid and severe deactivation by means of a series of physicochemical phenomena, including metal sintering, metallic phase oxidation, thermal degradation of the support and, more notoriously, coke deposition."
[4] "An emphasis is placed on coke deposition and its influence on deactivation, which depends on its location, chemical nature, morphology, precursors or formation mechanism, among others."
[5] "We also discuss the challenges for increasing the value of the carbon materials formed and therefore, enhance process viability."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism is critical for understanding the PDH process, but there is an ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the need for further research to elucidate the precise role of each step. Increasing the value of the carbon materials formed through the coke deposition process is one of the challenges discussed in enhancing the process viability.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。这个机制对于理解PDH过程至关重要，但关于解吸附吸附过程或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它强调了反应机制的复杂性，并强调了进一步研究以阐明每个步骤的确切作用的必要性。通过增加形成碳材料的价值来处理焦炭沉积过程，是提高过程可行性的挑战之一。
