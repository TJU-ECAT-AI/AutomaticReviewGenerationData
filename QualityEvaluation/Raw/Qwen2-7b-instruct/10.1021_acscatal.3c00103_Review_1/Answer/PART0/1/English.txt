The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH on Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption is often regarded as the rate-controlling step. However, there is ongoing debate over whether β-H extraction plays this crucial role instead. This disagreement has implications for our comprehension of the PDH process.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty influences the selection of catalysts and reaction conditions, as both steps affect the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process. Addressing the root cause of sintering requires a deeper understanding of the catalyst phase and morphology dynamics, beyond static characterization, and developing strategies that specifically target the underlying issues rather than merely remedying symptoms.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) includes three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption.

This ambiguity affects our understanding of the PDH process.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are broken down upon contact with a metallic catalyst, allowing individual hydrogen atoms to be extracted. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the propane molecule, while desorption is the release of the resulting products from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-limiting factor in the PDH process. This uncertainty significantly influences our understanding of how efficiently propane can be converted to other hydrocarbons through dehydrogenation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic conversion process.
