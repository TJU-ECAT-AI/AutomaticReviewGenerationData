          [1] "The positive role of hydrogen on the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt(111) has been extensively studied."
          [2] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
          [3] "Dissociative adsorption is considered the rate-controlling step in this reaction."
          [4] "However, there is ongoing debate regarding whether β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step."
          [5] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH on Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption is often regarded as the rate-controlling step. However, there is ongoing debate over whether β-H extraction plays this crucial role instead. This disagreement has implications for our comprehension of the PDH process.

          逆霍里图-波兰尼机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中涉及三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在Pt(111)上进行丙烷脱氢时，离解吸附通常被认为是控制步骤。然而，关于β-H提取是否扮演这一关键角色的争论仍然存在。这种分歧影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。
