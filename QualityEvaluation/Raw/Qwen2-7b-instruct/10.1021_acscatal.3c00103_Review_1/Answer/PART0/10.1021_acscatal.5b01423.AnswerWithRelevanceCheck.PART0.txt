          [1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
          [2] "The debate over which step is the rate-controlling one continues, with arguments supporting both the dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction processes."
          [3] "This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process and the factors influencing its efficiency."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling factor in this reaction. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process and the factors influencing its efficiency.
