          [1] "Revealing the Janus character of the coke precursor in the propane direct dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts from a kMC simulation"
          [2] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
          [3] "There is an ongoing debate as to which step—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process."
          [4] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences catalyst design and optimization strategies."

          Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three essential stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The process features an unresolved debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-determining step. This ambiguity affects our comprehension of the PDH process, influencing approaches to catalyst design and optimization.
