Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) includes three stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ambiguity concerning whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction controls the reaction rate affects our comprehension of the PDH process.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism's specifics are crucial for understanding the PDH process. However, there is an ongoing debate about which of these steps acts as the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions. The dissociative adsorption process and β-H extraction are both critical in determining the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction.
