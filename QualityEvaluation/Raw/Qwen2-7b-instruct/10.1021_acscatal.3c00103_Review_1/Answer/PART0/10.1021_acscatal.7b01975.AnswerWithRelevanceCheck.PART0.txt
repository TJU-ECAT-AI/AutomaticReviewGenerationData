          [1] "Reflecting morphological changes at the nanoscale, sintering will usually manifest itself in decreased catalytic activity or selectivity."
          [2] "Clearly, a singular antisintering strategy will not be satisfactory for all materials working under all conditions."
          [3] "Understanding the cause behind dynamic changes in catalyst phase and morphology is more complex than the static characterization of a material before or after catalysis."
          [4] "We believe that too often these cases remedy the problem, without specifically targeting the underlying cause."
          [5] "Clearly, a singular antisintering strategy will not be satisfactory for all materials working under all conditions."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty influences the selection of catalysts and reaction conditions, as both steps affect the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process. Addressing the root cause of sintering requires a deeper understanding of the catalyst phase and morphology dynamics, beyond static characterization, and developing strategies that specifically target the underlying issues rather than merely remedying symptoms.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反霍里图-波兰尼机制包含解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附三个步骤。关于哪个步骤，解离吸附还是β-H提取，是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性影响了催化剂的选择和反应条件的设定，因为这两个步骤都对PDH过程的整体效率和选择性有影响。解决烧结问题需要更深入地理解催化剂相态和形态动态，并开发能够直接针对根本原因的策略，而不仅仅是缓解症状。

          [1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
          [2] "The ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process."
          [3] "The uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step in the PDH process has significant implications for the development of more stable and efficient catalysts."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step in PDH affects our understanding of the process. This uncertainty is crucial for the advancement of more stable and efficient catalysts, as it guides the optimization of the PDH reaction through a clearer insight into the kinetics of each step.
