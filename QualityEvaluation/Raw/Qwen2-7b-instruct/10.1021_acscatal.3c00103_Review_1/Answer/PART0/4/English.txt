Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate continues over whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction acts as the rate-determining step in this reaction. This ambiguity influences our comprehension of the PDH process.
