          [1] "Beyond the Reverse HoriutiPolanyi Mechanism in Propane Dehydrogenation over Pt Catalysts"
          [2] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three main steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
          [3] "The rate-controlling step in this reaction is subject to ongoing debate among researchers."
          [4] "Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption process might be the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the β-H extraction is more critical."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts comprises three primary stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate among researchers revolves around which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-determining factor in this reaction.
