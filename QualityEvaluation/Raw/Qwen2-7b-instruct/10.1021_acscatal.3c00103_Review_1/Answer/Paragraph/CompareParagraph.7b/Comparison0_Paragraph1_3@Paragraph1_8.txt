    "Summary": "Both review articles effectively address the topic of the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism in propane dehydrogenation. They both offer insightful analysis, propose research directions, and highlight practical applications. However, neither review surpasses the other significantly in terms of content quality, innovation, contribution, methodology, or writing quality. Both could benefit from incorporating more interdisciplinary perspectives, a deeper analysis of existing research, and a more rigorous research design. The lack of differentiation in scores suggests that the two reviews are equally strong in most aspects."
