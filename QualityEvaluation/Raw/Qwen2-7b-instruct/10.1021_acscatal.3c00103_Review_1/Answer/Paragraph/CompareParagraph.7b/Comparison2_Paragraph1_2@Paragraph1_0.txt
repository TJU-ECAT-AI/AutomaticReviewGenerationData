They demonstrate high academic standards, including accurate citations, timely references, and clear organization. However, they lack innovation, proposing no new research directions or questions, and fail to make significant contributions to the field. Both articles exhibit reasonable writing quality and practical application potential, but their critical thinking does not surpass the standard expectations."
