        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.7b01584]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b01975], [10.1021/i200025a008], and [10.1039/tf9343001164]. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption, three sequential steps pivotal in the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons. This process is characterized by a significant uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, impacting our understanding of PDH efficiency and selectivity. The ongoing debate on this matter complicates catalyst design and optimization strategies, necessitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms to enhance PDH performance.
