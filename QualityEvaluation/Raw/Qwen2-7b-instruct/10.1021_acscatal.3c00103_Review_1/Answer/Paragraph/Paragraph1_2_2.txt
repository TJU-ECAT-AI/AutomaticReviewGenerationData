        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.7b01584], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b01975] and [10.1021/i200025a008]. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH on Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption is often regarded as the rate-controlling step. However, there is ongoing debate over whether β-H extraction plays this crucial role instead. This disagreement has implications for our comprehension of the PDH process.

        Reflecting morphological changes at the nanoscale, sintering will usually manifest itself in decreased catalytic activity or selectivity. Clearly, a singular antisintering strategy will not be satisfactory for all materials working under all conditions. Understanding the cause behind dynamic changes in catalyst phase and morphology is more complex than the static characterization of a material before or after catalysis. We believe that too often these cases remedy the problem, without specifically targeting the underlying cause.

        The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty influences the selection of catalysts and reaction conditions, as both steps affect the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process. Addressing the root cause of sintering requires a deeper understanding of the catalyst phase and morphology dynamics, beyond static characterization, and developing strategies that specifically target the underlying issues rather than merely remedying symptoms.

        Beyond the Reverse HoriutiPolanyi Mechanism in Propane Dehydrogenation over Pt Catalysts, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism comprises three primary stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate among researchers revolves around which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-determining factor in this reaction.
