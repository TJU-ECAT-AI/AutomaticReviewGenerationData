            The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH on Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption is often regarded as the rate-controlling step. However, there is ongoing debate over whether β-H extraction plays this crucial role instead. This disagreement has implications for our comprehension of the PDH process.

            Reflecting morphological changes at the nanoscale, sintering will usually manifest itself in decreased catalytic activity or selectivity. Clearly, a singular antisintering strategy will not be satisfactory for all materials working under all conditions. Understanding the cause behind dynamic changes in catalyst phase and morphology is more complex than the static characterization of a material before or after catalysis. We believe that too often these cases remedy the problem, without specifically targeting the underlying cause. A deeper understanding of the catalyst phase and morphology dynamics, beyond static characterization, and developing strategies that specifically target the underlying issues rather than merely remedying symptoms is necessary.

            The uncertainty about which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process significantly influences our understanding of how efficiently propane can be converted to other hydrocarbons through dehydrogenation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic conversion process. Addressing the root cause of sintering requires a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst phase and morphology dynamics and strategic approaches that specifically target the underlying mechanisms.

            Beyond the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, there is a persistent debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-limiting step in the PDH process. This ambiguity complicates our understanding of the PDH process and the factors influencing its efficiency. The ongoing discussion about the rate-controlling step impacts the selection of catalysts and reaction conditions, as both steps affect the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

            The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step in the PDH process complicates our understanding of the process and the factors influencing its efficiency.

Addressing this uncertainty requires a deeper understanding of the catalyst phase and morphology dynamics and strategic approaches that specifically target the underlying mechanisms.

            The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts comprises three primary stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption.

            The positive role of hydrogen on the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt(111) has been extensively studied. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are broken down upon contact with a metallic catalyst, allowing individual hydrogen atoms to be extracted. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the propane molecule, while desorption is the release of the resulting products from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-limiting factor in the PDH process. This uncertainty significantly influences our understanding of how efficiently propane can be converted to other hydrocarbons through dehydrogenation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic conversion process.

It influences the selection of catalysts and reaction conditions, as both steps affect the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

            The uncertainty about the rate-controlling step in the PDH process complicates our understanding of the process and the factors influencing its efficiency. It affects the design and optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions, as both steps play critical roles in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.
