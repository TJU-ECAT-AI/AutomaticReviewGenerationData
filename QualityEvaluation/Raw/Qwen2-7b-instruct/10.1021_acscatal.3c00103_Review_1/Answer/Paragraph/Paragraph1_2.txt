        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.7b01584]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b01975], [10.1021/i200025a008], and [10.1039/tf9343001164]. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH on Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption is often regarded as the rate-controlling step. However, there is ongoing debate over whether β-H extraction plays this crucial role instead. This disagreement has implications for our comprehension of the PDH process.

        Reflecting morphological changes at the nanoscale, sintering will usually manifest itself in decreased catalytic activity or selectivity. Clearly, a singular antisintering strategy will not be satisfactory for all materials working under all conditions. Understanding the cause behind dynamic changes in catalyst phase and morphology is more complex than the static characterization of a material before or after catalysis. We believe that too often these cases remedy the problem, without specifically targeting the underlying cause.

        The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts comprises three primary stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption.

This uncertainty significantly influences our understanding of how efficiently propane can be converted to other hydrocarbons through dehydrogenation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic conversion process.

        The positive role of hydrogen on the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt(111) has been extensively studied. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three essential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are broken down upon contact with a metallic catalyst, allowing individual hydrogen atoms to be extracted. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the propane molecule, while desorption is the release of the resulting products from the catalyst surface.
