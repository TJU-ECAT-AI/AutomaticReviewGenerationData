2.1. Introduction
"A longstanding problem affecting many applications that use highly dispersed metal nanoparticles is loss of active surface area in the metal components as a result of sintering. This is a particularly pernicious problem in applications in which catalysts have to experience high temperatures."
2.2. Ultra accelerated quantum chemical molecular dynamics (UA-QCMD) method
"We used our in-house code for ultra accelerated quantum chemical molecular dynamics (UA-QCMD) to investigate the adsorbed electronic, structural and diffusional characteristics of Pt on the surface of support metal oxides under high temperature conditions."
2.3. Sintering simulation by kinetic Monte Carlo simulation
"Diffusions of supported particles as well as support particles were simulated by kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method [11] ."
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Adsorption conditions of Pt on supports
"Binding energies of Pt37 and the oxygen of supports were estimated by tight-binding based quantum chemical calculation program, COLORS."
3.2. Diffusion characteristics of Pt
"UA-QCMD calculations were carried out for 1.0 × 108 steps with a 1.0 fs time increment under a realistic durability temperature condition, 1073 K."
3.3. Porous structure of catalyst model
"We built a three-dimensional irregular complex porous structure with an automatic porous structure model generator based on an original overlap-allowed particle packing method [13] ."
3.4. Sintering of Pt particles
"A series of sintering simulations were conducted by the 3-dimensional sintering simulator, SINTA at constant temperature, 1073 K for 5 h with integral time step Δt = 0.01 s."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is not discussed in the provided literature. Therefore, there are no relevant quotes to answer the question. The literature focuses on the multi-scale theoretical study of the sintering dynamics of Pt on various catalyst supports, specifically γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2. It discusses the development of a 3D sintering simulator, UA-QCMD method for investigating adsorption conditions, diffusion characteristics of Pt, and sintering of Pt particles. However, it does not cover the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH or the ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in the dissociative adsorption process or β-H extraction.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）没有在提供的文献中进行讨论。因此，没有相关的引用来回答这个问题。该文献专注于Pt在不同催化剂支持（γ-Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）上的多尺度烧结动力学的研究。它讨论了开发3D烧结模拟器、基于超加速量子化学分子动力学（UA-QCMD）方法来研究吸附条件、Pt扩散特性以及Pt颗粒的烧结。然而，它没有涵盖PDH的反霍里图-波兰尼机制或β-H提取过程的速率控制步骤的争论。
