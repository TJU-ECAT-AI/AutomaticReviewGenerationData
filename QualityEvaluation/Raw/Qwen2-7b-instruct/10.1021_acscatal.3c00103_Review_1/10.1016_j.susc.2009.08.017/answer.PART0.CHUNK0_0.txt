The study focuses on understanding the sintering dynamics of platinum (Pt) on different catalyst supports, including γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2. It employs a combination of ultra accelerated quantum chemical molecular dynamics (UA-QCMD) for micro-scale investigations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation for macro-scale sintering dynamics. The aim is to clarify the relationship between the supported precious metal and the support material and to predict the potential performance of catalysts, offering an efficient alternative methodology to experimental durability testing.
