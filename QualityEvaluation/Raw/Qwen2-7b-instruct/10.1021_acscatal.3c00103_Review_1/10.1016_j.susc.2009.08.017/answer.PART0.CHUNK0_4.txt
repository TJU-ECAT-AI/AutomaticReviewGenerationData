<p>While Pt on γ-Al2O3 sintered significantly, Pt on ZrO2 sintered slightly and Pt on CeO2 demonstrated the highest stability against sintering.</p>
<p>In the case of Pt/γ-Al2O3, as shown in Fig. 5, Pt particle size on γ-Al2O3 after aging was experimentally estimated about 23.6 nm by the CO pulse method and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) data.</p>

<p>In the case of Pt/ZrO2 as shown in Fig. 6, Pt particle size on ZrO2 after aging was estimated experimentally about 15 nm by the CO pulse method.</p>
<p>In sintering dynamics simulation, the Pt particles were found to be sintered, and the size increased over a range of 1118 nm. The mean particle size is 14.5 nm as shown in Fig. 9, which is close to experimental value.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 7, Pt particles remained highly dispersed on CeO2 support after aging 5 h and the Pt particle size was less than 2 nm as shown in Fig. 10. Simulation results agreed well with experimental result showing Pt in the CeO2 catalyst did not sinter at all.</p>

The multi-scale theoretical study highlighted significant differences in the sintering behavior of platinum (Pt) supported on different catalyst supports. Platinum supported on γ-Al2O3 experienced substantial sintering, resulting in Pt particles growing up to 23.6 nm, closely matching experimental findings. Conversely, Pt supported on ZrO2 showed slight sintering, leading to particle sizes around 15 nm, again in alignment with experimental data. Most notably, Pt on CeO2 demonstrated exceptional stability against sintering, with Pt particles remaining dispersed and below 2 nm after aging. These findings suggest that the support material significantly influences the sintering dynamics of Pt nanoparticles.

多尺度理论研究揭示了铂（Pt）在不同催化剂支撑上烧结行为的显著差异。在γ-Al2O3上的铂经历大量烧结，铂颗粒增长至约23.6 nm，与实验结果相匹配。相反，在ZrO2上的铂显示出轻微的烧结，导致颗粒大小约为15 nm，这也符合实验数据。最值得注意的是，在CeO2上的铂表现出对烧结的最高稳定性，铂颗粒保持分散状态，且在老化后小于2 nm。这些发现表明，支撑材料对铂纳米颗粒的烧结动力学有重大影响。
