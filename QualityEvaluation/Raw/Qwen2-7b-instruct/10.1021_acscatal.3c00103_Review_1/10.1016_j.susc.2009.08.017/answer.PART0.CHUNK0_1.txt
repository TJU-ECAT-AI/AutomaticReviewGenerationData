[1] "Although the precise mechanism of PDH is not fully understood, the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism plays a crucial role in this reaction."
[2] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[3] "The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step has led to a significant debate among chemists."
[4] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects predictions about reaction rates and product yields."
