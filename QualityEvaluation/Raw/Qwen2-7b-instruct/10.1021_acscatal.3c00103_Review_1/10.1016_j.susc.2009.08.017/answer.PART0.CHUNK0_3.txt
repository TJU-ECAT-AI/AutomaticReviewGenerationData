<p>Al2O3 has the advantages in its high hardness and wear resistance. Especially, γ-Al2O3 with large surface area and good thermal stability is widely used as a support material [1].</p>
<p>Ceria acts as an oxygen storage/release component by shifting the oxidation conditions between CeO2 and CeO2x under reaction conditions made possible by the high availability of surface oxygen, thus allowing oxygen storage and release to occur easily. However, the oxygen storage/release capacity (OSC) and durability of pure ceria are still inadequate for practical use in TWC.</p>
<p>ZrO2 additions increase the fracture toughness of ceramic materials although it has low surface area compared to other supports, especially, addition of ZrO2 into the CeO2 lattice, as a CeZr mixed oxides, have been found to be effective in strongly preventing the ceria from sintering and promoting the OSC [2], [3].</p>
<p>In the case of Pt/γ-Al2O3, as shown in Fig. 5, Pt particle size on γ-Al2O3 after aging was experimentally estimated about 23.6 nm by the CO pulse method and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) data [14]. In sintering dynamics simulation, the Pt particles, as shown in Fig. 8, were found to be sintered up to 23 nm, which is close to the experimental value.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some Pt particles remained small particle as 15 nm. These particles were hindered from agglomeration in fine pore structures of thermally stable γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>In the case of Pt/ZrO2 as shown in Fig. 6, Pt particle size on ZrO2 after aging was estimated experimentally about 15 nm by the CO pulse method [14]. In sintering dynamics simulation, the Pt particles were found to be sintered, and the size increased over a range of 1118 nm. The mean particle size is 14.5 nm as shown in Fig. 9, which is close to experimental value.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 7, Pt particles remained highly dispersed on CeO2 support after aging 5 h and the Pt particle size was less than 2 nm as shown in Fig. 10. Simulation results agreed well with experimental result [14] showing Pt in the CeO2 catalyst did not sinter at all.</p>

The literature discusses the differences in sintering behavior of Pt on various supports, including γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2. The γ-Al2O3 support leads to significant sintering of Pt, resulting in particle sizes up to 23.6 nm, which is close to the experimental estimate. ZrO2, when added to the CeO2 lattice, increases the fracture toughness of ceramic materials and effectively prevents the ceria from sintering. However, Pt on CeO2 support demonstrates the highest stability against sintering, with particle sizes remaining below 2 nm after aging. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between Pt nanoparticles and different support materials, influencing their stability and catalytic performance.

文献讨论了铂在不同支持材料上的烧结行为差异，包括γ-Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2。γ-Al2O3支持导致铂显著烧结，颗粒大小可达23.6 nm，接近实验估计值。当ZrO2添加到CeO2晶格中时，提高了陶瓷材料的断裂韧性和有效防止了铈的烧结。然而，CeO2基催化剂上的铂表现出最高的稳定性，颗粒尺寸在老化5小时后仍低于2 nm。这些发现有助于更好地理解铂纳米颗粒与不同支持材料之间的相互作用，影响其稳定性和催化性能。
