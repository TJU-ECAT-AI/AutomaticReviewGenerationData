The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact details of these steps are outlined in the referenced article. The ongoing debate centers around which of these two processes, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. This uncertainty has significant implications for understanding the kinetics and efficiency of the PDH process.
