The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are broken down upon contact with a metallic catalyst, allowing individual hydrogen atoms to be extracted. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the propane molecule, while desorption is the release of the resulting products from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-limiting factor in the PDH process. This uncertainty significantly influences our understanding of how efficiently propane can be converted to other hydrocarbons through dehydrogenation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic conversion process.

逆霍里图蒂-波拉尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在与金属催化剂接触时被分解，允许单个氢原子被提取的过程。β-H提取步骤涉及从丙烷分子中移除氢原子，而脱附是产物从催化剂表面释放的过程。持续的争议集中在这些步骤中的哪一步，解离吸附或β-H提取，作为反应速率限制因素。这种不确定性显著影响我们对如何高效地将丙烷转化为其他烃类的理解，从而影响催化转化过程的效率和选择性。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism is debated whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, leading to uncertainty in understanding the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by causing confusion about the kinetic pathway and potential optimization strategies.
