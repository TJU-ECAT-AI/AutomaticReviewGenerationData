<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding which step is rate-controlling remains uncertain. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, necessitating further research to clarify the mechanism and identify the rate-limiting step.
