<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism is debated whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, leading to uncertainty in understanding the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by causing confusion about the kinetic pathway and potential optimization strategies.

反霍里乌蒂-波拉尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制争论是解离吸附还是β-H提取是控制速率的步骤，导致对PDH过程的理解存在不确定性。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它导致了关于动力学途径和潜在优化策略的混淆。
