The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface, β-H extraction resulting in the formation of propene, and desorption of the newly formed propene molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate among researchers revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction step controls the reaction rate, significantly impacting the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波拉尼机制的丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个步骤：丙烷分子在催化剂表面的离解吸附，导致β-H提取并形成丙烯，以及新形成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面的脱附。研究人员之间的争论集中在离解吸附过程或β-H提取过程是否控制反应速率，这对PDH过程的效率和选择性有着重大影响。
