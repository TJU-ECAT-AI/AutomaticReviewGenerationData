<p>Two limiting mechanisms for catalyst sintering have been proposed: Ostwald ripening (OR) and particle migration and coalescence (PMC). Under OR, it is assumed that the metal particles are immobile and sintering occurs solely due to the migration of atoms or clusters from small particles to the large particles. The driving force for sintering comes from the higher chemical potential of the metal atoms in small particles as a consequence of their radius of curvature. The kinetics of OR are given by the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory [7] which results in a stationary (self-similar) particle size distribution (PSD) and a growth law where increases linearly with time.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 (a) shows a typical LSW size distribution from the work of Finsy [7] for the case where surface diffusion is the rate-limiting step. The size distribution for PMC is very different in that it is skewed to the right, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The mechanism for PMC was analyzed by Granqvist and Buhrmann [6] who showed that the particle size distribution corresponds to a log normal distribution function (LNDF).</p>
<p>One of the earliest studies was by Granqvist and Buhrmann [6] who scrutinized a number of published size distributions and advocated the view that coalescence growth provided the most plausible explanation for sintering mechanism. Their argument was based on the fact that their theoretical development provided a rigorous justification for migration and coalescence mechanism leading to a log normal size distribution.</p>
<p>The work presented here is no exception, with all of our data fitting the LNDF model as well. On the other hand, most published theoretical size distributions for the LSW model predict a distribution skewed towards the smaller particle sizes [8] ,[21] ,[22].</p>
<p>However, in both cases we fail to detect any smaller particles being generated with increasing sintering time. It appears that any small particles that are being generated due to the ripening process are disappearing faster than they are being created, so we do not see them experimentally.</p>
<p>The absence of a pronounced tail towards small particles in a size distribution should not be used as a criterion for ruling out Ostwald ripening as the prevailing mechanism.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not directly discuss the ongoing debate on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. However, it does not provide enough detail to conclusively state which step is rate-controlling. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the need for further research to clarify the relative importance of each step.

Uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step in the PDH process affects our understanding of the reaction mechanism and kinetics. It suggests that the process may involve multiple rate-determining steps, and that the relative contributions of these steps can vary under different conditions. This complexity underscores the importance of detailed kinetic studies and theoretical modeling to elucidate the specific mechanisms governing PDH. Without clear identification of the rate-controlling step, predictions of reaction rates, product yields, and catalyst efficiency may be uncertain, potentially leading to suboptimal process design and operation.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献没有直接讨论关于在该反应中解离吸附过程或β-H提取是控制步骤的持续争论。然而，它没有提供足够的细节来明确地声明哪个步骤是控制步骤。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它强调了反应机制的复杂性，并表明在不同条件下各步骤的重要性可能有所不同。

PDH过程的控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对反应机制和动力学的理解。这表明过程可能涉及多个控制步骤，且这些步骤的相对贡献可能因条件不同而变化。这种复杂性强调了进行详细动力学研究和理论建模以阐明PDH特定机制的重要性。没有明确识别出控制步骤，预测反应速率、产物产率和催化剂效率可能会有不确定性，这可能导致过程设计和操作的优化不足。
