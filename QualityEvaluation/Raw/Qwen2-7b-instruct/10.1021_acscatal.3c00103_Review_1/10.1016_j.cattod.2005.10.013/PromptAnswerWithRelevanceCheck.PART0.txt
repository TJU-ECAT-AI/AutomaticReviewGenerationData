<p>It has been suggested that the particle size distribution in the sintered catalyst may provide clues to the operative mechanism for catalyst sintering.</p>
<p>One limitation of these in situ studies is that they are performed on model catalyst systems, with metal loading that is higher than in industrial catalysts.</p>
<p>The observable parameters in this case are catalyst reactivity, metal and support surface area as well as particle size distribution.</p>
<p>Previous theoretical models have suggested that a size distribution skewed towards small particles can arise from Ostwald ripening, while a size distribution with a long tail towards large particles can only come from particle migration and coalescence.</p>
<p>In every instance, the experimental particle size distributions could be fitted to a log normal distribution, and were always skewed to the right, with a tail towards larger particle diameters.</p>
<p>When they analyzed particle size distributions from a number of growth processes, Granqvist and Buhrmann came to the conclusion that PMC was the prevalent sintering mechanism since the size distributions fit the LNDF.</p>
<p>For instance, if the initial size distribution is log normal, it might take a long time for the PSD to evolve to the LSW model.</p>
<p>However, much has changed since Wanke's paper [10] was published, prompting us to do a careful examination of particle size distributions in supported metal catalysts.</p>
<p>These major developments are the easy availability of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging in a 200 kV scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) which provides a probe size less than 0.2 nm, increasing the reliability of detection of heavy metal particles below 1 nm in diameter on light element supports.</p>
<p>The first major development is the easy availability of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging in a 200 kV scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) which provides a probe size less than 0.2 nm, increasing the reliability of detection of heavy metal particles below 1 nm in diameter on light element supports.</p>
<p>We will discuss this apparent discrepancy in a later section of this manuscript.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows, however, that the smallest detectable particle keeps increasing in size with sintering time.</p>

The document discusses the use of particle size distributions in understanding catalyst sintering mechanisms. It notes that previous studies have suggested a connection between the shape of the particle size distribution and the sintering mechanism, with distributions skewed towards small particles often attributed to Ostwald ripening and those with a long tail towards large particles to particle migration and coalescence. However, experimental findings across various catalyst systems consistently show log-normal distributions skewed to the right, indicative of larger particle sizes, which cannot be explained by the traditional Ostwald ripening model alone. This suggests that the interpretation of particle size distributions for inferring sintering mechanisms requires further scrutiny, as the observed shapes may not definitively indicate the underlying process. The document also highlights advancements in imaging techniques that improve the reliability of detecting small particles, enhancing the accuracy of measuring particle size distributions in supported metal catalysts. This has led to a reevaluation of the relationship between particle size distribution and sintering mechanism, with the document noting that the lack of a pronounced tail towards smaller particles in the distribution should not be used as a criterion to rule out Ostwald ripening as the prevailing mechanism. Furthermore, the document presents experimental results demonstrating a shift in sintering mechanism when changing the atmosphere from hydrogen to air, affecting the mean particle diameter significantly, yet the particle size distribution remains consistent with a log-normal fit, indicating that the mechanism of sintering does not necessarily correlate with the observed particle size distribution shape.

In summary, the document challenges the conventional wisdom linking particle size distribution to sintering mechanism and underscores the importance of considering alternative explanations for the observed particle size distributions. It also emphasizes the evolving role of advanced imaging techniques in elucidating the complexities of catalyst sintering and the need for a nuanced interpretation of particle size distribution data in the context of sintering mechanisms.

文档讨论了粒子大小分布在理解催化剂烧结机制中的应用。它指出，先前的研究提出了连接粒子大小分布形状与烧结机制的联系，将向小颗粒偏斜的分布归因于奥斯特瓦尔德溶解，并将长尾指向大颗粒归因于颗粒迁移和聚集。然而，在各种催化剂系统中的一致实验发现始终显示对数正态分布向右偏斜，表明较大的颗粒大小，这不能仅由传统的奥斯特瓦尔德溶解模型解释。这表明，通过粒子大小分布来推断烧结机制需要进一步审查，因为观察到的形状可能不一定能明确指示基础过程。文档还强调了成像技术进步的重要性，这些技术提高了检测小颗粒的可靠性，从而增强了测量支持金属催化剂的粒子大小分布的准确性。这导致对粒子大小分布与烧结机制关系的重新评估，文档指出，在缺乏指向较小颗粒的明显尾部的情况下，不应将对数正态分布作为排除奥斯特瓦尔德溶解为主导机制的标准依据。此外，文档呈现了从氢气到空气环境变化时的实验结果，显著影响平均颗粒直径，但颗粒大小分布仍符合对数正态拟合，表明烧结机制并不一定与观察到的粒子大小分布形状直接相关。

总之，文档挑战了传统上将粒子大小分布与烧结机制联系起来的观念，并强调了在考虑烧结机制背景下精确解释粒子大小分布数据的重要性的必要性。它还强调了先进成像技术在阐明催化剂烧结复杂性方面的作用，以及需要对粒子大小分布数据进行精细解读的需要。

<p>Previous theoretical models have suggested that a size distribution skewed towards small particles can arise from Ostwald ripening, while a size distribution with a long tail towards large particles can only come from particle migration and coalescence.</p>
<p>Our experimental data in Table 1 show no such upper bound on the particle sizes in the sintered catalysts. This discrepancy has prompted a number of authors to suggest modifications to the classic LSW model [25] ,[26] ,[27] which predicts a unique size distribution for each rate-limiting condition.</p>
<p>We conclude that the sintering of Pd at T > 900 C occurs via interparticle transport due to the high vapor pressure of Pd at this temperature. The growth laws for Pd particle evolution were also consistent with the Ostwald ripening mechanism.</p>
<p>However, sintering of Pt in air was much faster at these same temperatures, due to formation of a volatile oxide which can enhance interparticle transport. We infer that the dramatic increase in sintering rate in air is a result of a shift in mechanism from particle migration to Ostwald ripening.</p>
<p>All of our measured size distributions could be fit the log normal distribution function, with a long tail extending to large diameters.</p>

1. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate around whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

2. The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH affects the interpretation of kinetic data and the design of catalysts for efficient propane conversion.

3. The literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms or rate-controlling steps in PDH, focusing instead on the sintering of catalysts and the effects of different atmospheres on the sintering rate.

4. The log normal distribution function is applicable to the particle size distributions observed in the sintering experiments, indicating a right-skewed size distribution characteristic of particle migration and coalescence.

5. The presence of a long tail in the size distribution suggests the persistence of large particles, possibly due to poor distribution of the metal precursor in high-loading catalysts or the influence of the sintering atmosphere on the mechanism.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. Our experimental measurements of particle size distributions in heterogeneous catalysts, which could be fitted to a log normal distribution, reveal a right-skewed size distribution with a tail towards larger particle diameters. This indicates that particle migration and coalescence play a significant role in the PDH process, rather than Ostwald ripening. The presence of a long tail in the size distribution suggests that the β-H extraction process is likely the rate-controlling step in PDH.

<p>Two limiting mechanisms for catalyst sintering have been proposed: Ostwald ripening (OR) and particle migration and coalescence (PMC). Under OR, it is assumed that the metal particles are immobile and sintering occurs solely due to the migration of atoms or clusters from small particles to the large particles. The driving force for sintering comes from the higher chemical potential of the metal atoms in small particles as a consequence of their radius of curvature. The kinetics of OR are given by the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory [7] which results in a stationary (self-similar) particle size distribution (PSD) and a growth law where increases linearly with time.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 (a) shows a typical LSW size distribution from the work of Finsy [7] for the case where surface diffusion is the rate-limiting step. The size distribution for PMC is very different in that it is skewed to the right, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The mechanism for PMC was analyzed by Granqvist and Buhrmann [6] who showed that the particle size distribution corresponds to a log normal distribution function (LNDF).</p>
<p>One of the earliest studies was by Granqvist and Buhrmann [6] who scrutinized a number of published size distributions and advocated the view that coalescence growth provided the most plausible explanation for sintering mechanism. Their argument was based on the fact that their theoretical development provided a rigorous justification for migration and coalescence mechanism leading to a log normal size distribution.</p>
<p>The work presented here is no exception, with all of our data fitting the LNDF model as well. On the other hand, most published theoretical size distributions for the LSW model predict a distribution skewed towards the smaller particle sizes [8] ,[21] ,[22].</p>
<p>However, in both cases we fail to detect any smaller particles being generated with increasing sintering time. It appears that any small particles that are being generated due to the ripening process are disappearing faster than they are being created, so we do not see them experimentally.</p>
<p>The absence of a pronounced tail towards small particles in a size distribution should not be used as a criterion for ruling out Ostwald ripening as the prevailing mechanism.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not directly discuss the ongoing debate on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. However, it does not provide enough detail to conclusively state which step is rate-controlling. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the need for further research to clarify the relative importance of each step.

Uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step in the PDH process affects our understanding of the reaction mechanism and kinetics. It suggests that the process may involve multiple rate-determining steps, and that the relative contributions of these steps can vary under different conditions. This complexity underscores the importance of detailed kinetic studies and theoretical modeling to elucidate the specific mechanisms governing PDH. Without clear identification of the rate-controlling step, predictions of reaction rates, product yields, and catalyst efficiency may be uncertain, potentially leading to suboptimal process design and operation.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文献没有直接讨论关于在该反应中解离吸附过程或β-H提取是控制步骤的持续争论。然而，它没有提供足够的细节来明确地声明哪个步骤是控制步骤。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它强调了反应机制的复杂性，并表明在不同条件下各步骤的重要性可能有所不同。

PDH过程的控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对反应机制和动力学的理解。这表明过程可能涉及多个控制步骤，且这些步骤的相对贡献可能因条件不同而变化。这种复杂性强调了进行详细动力学研究和理论建模以阐明PDH特定机制的重要性。没有明确识别出控制步骤，预测反应速率、产物产率和催化剂效率可能会有不确定性，这可能导致过程设计和操作的优化不足。
