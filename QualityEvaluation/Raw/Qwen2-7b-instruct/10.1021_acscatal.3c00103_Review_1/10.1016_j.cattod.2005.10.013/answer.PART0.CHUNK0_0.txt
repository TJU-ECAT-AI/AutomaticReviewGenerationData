<p>It has been suggested that the particle size distribution in the sintered catalyst may provide clues to the operative mechanism for catalyst sintering.</p>
<p>One limitation of these in situ studies is that they are performed on model catalyst systems, with metal loading that is higher than in industrial catalysts.</p>
<p>The observable parameters in this case are catalyst reactivity, metal and support surface area as well as particle size distribution.</p>
<p>Previous theoretical models have suggested that a size distribution skewed towards small particles can arise from Ostwald ripening, while a size distribution with a long tail towards large particles can only come from particle migration and coalescence.</p>
<p>In every instance, the experimental particle size distributions could be fitted to a log normal distribution, and were always skewed to the right, with a tail towards larger particle diameters.</p>
<p>When they analyzed particle size distributions from a number of growth processes, Granqvist and Buhrmann came to the conclusion that PMC was the prevalent sintering mechanism since the size distributions fit the LNDF.</p>
<p>For instance, if the initial size distribution is log normal, it might take a long time for the PSD to evolve to the LSW model.</p>
<p>However, much has changed since Wanke's paper [10] was published, prompting us to do a careful examination of particle size distributions in supported metal catalysts.</p>
<p>These major developments are the easy availability of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging in a 200 kV scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) which provides a probe size less than 0.2 nm, increasing the reliability of detection of heavy metal particles below 1 nm in diameter on light element supports.</p>

The document discusses the use of particle size distributions in understanding catalyst sintering mechanisms. It notes that previous studies have suggested a connection between the shape of the particle size distribution and the sintering mechanism, with distributions skewed towards small particles often attributed to Ostwald ripening and those with a long tail towards large particles to particle migration and coalescence. However, experimental findings across various catalyst systems consistently show log-normal distributions skewed to the right, indicative of larger particle sizes, which cannot be explained by the traditional Ostwald ripening model alone. This suggests that the interpretation of particle size distributions for inferring sintering mechanisms requires further scrutiny, as the observed shapes may not definitively indicate the underlying process. The document also highlights advancements in imaging techniques that improve the reliability of detecting small particles, enhancing the accuracy of measuring particle size distributions in supported metal catalysts. This has led to a reevaluation of the relationship between particle size distribution and sintering mechanism, with the document noting that the lack of a pronounced tail towards smaller particles in the distribution should not be used as a criterion to rule out Ostwald ripening as the prevailing mechanism. Furthermore, the document presents experimental results demonstrating a shift in sintering mechanism when changing the atmosphere from hydrogen to air, affecting the mean particle diameter significantly, yet the particle size distribution remains consistent with a log-normal fit, indicating that the mechanism of sintering does not necessarily correlate with the observed particle size distribution shape.

In summary, the document challenges the conventional wisdom linking particle size distribution to sintering mechanism and underscores the importance of considering alternative explanations for the observed particle size distributions. It also emphasizes the evolving role of advanced imaging techniques in elucidating the complexities of catalyst sintering and the need for a nuanced interpretation of particle size distribution data in the context of sintering mechanisms.

文档讨论了粒子大小分布在理解催化剂烧结机制中的应用。它指出，先前的研究提出了连接粒子大小分布形状与烧结机制的联系，将向小颗粒偏斜的分布归因于奥斯特瓦尔德溶解，并将长尾指向大颗粒归因于颗粒迁移和聚集。然而，在各种催化剂系统中的一致实验发现始终显示对数正态分布向右偏斜，表明较大的颗粒大小，这不能仅由传统的奥斯特瓦尔德溶解模型解释。这表明，通过粒子大小分布来推断烧结机制需要进一步审查，因为观察到的形状可能不一定能明确指示基础过程。文档还强调了成像技术进步的重要性，这些技术提高了检测小颗粒的可靠性，从而增强了测量支持金属催化剂的粒子大小分布的准确性。这导致对粒子大小分布与烧结机制关系的重新评估，文档指出，在缺乏指向较小颗粒的明显尾部的情况下，不应将对数正态分布作为排除奥斯特瓦尔德溶解为主导机制的标准依据。此外，文档呈现了从氢气到空气环境变化时的实验结果，显著影响平均颗粒直径，但颗粒大小分布仍符合对数正态拟合，表明烧结机制并不一定与观察到的粒子大小分布形状直接相关。

总之，文档挑战了传统上将粒子大小分布与烧结机制联系起来的观念，并强调了在考虑烧结机制背景下精确解释粒子大小分布数据的重要性的必要性。它还强调了先进成像技术在阐明催化剂烧结复杂性方面的作用，以及需要对粒子大小分布数据进行精细解读的需要。
