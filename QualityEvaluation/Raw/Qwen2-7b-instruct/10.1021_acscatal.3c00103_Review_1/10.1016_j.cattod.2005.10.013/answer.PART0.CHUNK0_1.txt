<p>Previous theoretical models have suggested that a size distribution skewed towards small particles can arise from Ostwald ripening, while a size distribution with a long tail towards large particles can only come from particle migration and coalescence.</p>
<p>Our experimental data in Table 1 show no such upper bound on the particle sizes in the sintered catalysts. This discrepancy has prompted a number of authors to suggest modifications to the classic LSW model [25] ,[26] ,[27] which predicts a unique size distribution for each rate-limiting condition.</p>
<p>We conclude that the sintering of Pd at T > 900 C occurs via interparticle transport due to the high vapor pressure of Pd at this temperature. The growth laws for Pd particle evolution were also consistent with the Ostwald ripening mechanism.</p>
<p>However, sintering of Pt in air was much faster at these same temperatures, due to formation of a volatile oxide which can enhance interparticle transport. We infer that the dramatic increase in sintering rate in air is a result of a shift in mechanism from particle migration to Ostwald ripening.</p>
<p>All of our measured size distributions could be fit the log normal distribution function, with a long tail extending to large diameters.</p>

1. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate around whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

2. The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH affects the interpretation of kinetic data and the design of catalysts for efficient propane conversion.

3. The literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms or rate-controlling steps in PDH, focusing instead on the sintering of catalysts and the effects of different atmospheres on the sintering rate.

4. The log normal distribution function is applicable to the particle size distributions observed in the sintering experiments, indicating a right-skewed size distribution characteristic of particle migration and coalescence.

5. The presence of a long tail in the size distribution suggests the persistence of large particles, possibly due to poor distribution of the metal precursor in high-loading catalysts or the influence of the sintering atmosphere on the mechanism.

1. 逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含三个步骤：解吸附吸附，β-H提取和脱附。关于解吸附吸附或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。

2. PDH中速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了动力学数据的解释以及高效丙烷转化催化剂的设计。

3. 文献没有直接涉及PDH的具体机制或速率控制步骤，而是关注催化剂的烧结和不同气氛下烧结速率的影响。

4. 观察到的颗粒尺寸分布符合对数正态分布函数，表明了颗粒迁移和聚集导致的右偏分布。

5. 长尾的存在可能是因为高负载催化剂中金属前体分布不佳，或者由于烧结气氛对机制的影响而导致大颗粒的持续存在。
