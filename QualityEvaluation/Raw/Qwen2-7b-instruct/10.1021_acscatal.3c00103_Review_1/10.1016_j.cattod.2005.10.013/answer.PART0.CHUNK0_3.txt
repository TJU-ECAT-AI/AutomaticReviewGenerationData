<p>The classical development of the LSW model for Ostwald ripening leads to a size distribution skewed towards smaller particles.</p>
<p>Our experimental measurements also show a long tail in the size distribution, extending to extremely large particles.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. Our experimental measurements of particle size distributions in heterogeneous catalysts, which could be fitted to a log normal distribution, reveal a right-skewed size distribution with a tail towards larger particle diameters. This indicates that particle migration and coalescence play a significant role in the PDH process, rather than Ostwald ripening. The presence of a long tail in the size distribution suggests that the β-H extraction process is likely the rate-controlling step in PDH.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。争论的焦点在于解离吸附过程或β-H提取过程是否是控制速率的关键步骤。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。我们在异质催化剂中进行的颗粒大小分布测量可以拟合到对数正态分布，显示了一个向较大颗粒直径尾部延伸的右偏分布。这表明在PDH过程中，颗粒迁移和凝聚起着重要作用，而不是奥斯特瓦尔德成核。分布中出现的长尾表明β-H提取过程可能是PDH的关键控制步骤。
