The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism suggests that propane molecules adsorb onto the surface of the catalyst, followed by the removal of a hydrogen atom (β-H extraction) from the propane molecule to form propylene. The product propylene then desorbs from the surface. 

The ongoing debate in the field revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction step is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences how we design catalysts and optimize reaction conditions. The document discusses the effect of shaping Pt nanoparticles on the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in PDH. It highlights that octahedral particles, dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface, exhibit higher selectivity towards propylene production and better stability compared to cubic particles, which are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface.

The document explains that the higher selectivity of octahedral particles towards propylene production is due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. This results in a lower formation possibility of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates. Additionally, when coke is formed on the Pt surface, it leads to the deactivation of the catalyst, as the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms shifts farther below the Fermi level. The document concludes with the statement that its DFT calculations provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observations regarding the shape effects on PDH.

The shape of the metal particles, specifically the presence of different facets like Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 0 0), and Pt(2 1 1), significantly influences the catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH. By optimizing the particle shape, researchers can enhance the efficiency of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个连续步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制表明，丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附，随后从丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子（β-H提取）形成丙烯。产物丙烯然后从表面脱附。

关于PDH过程中哪一步是控制速率的步骤，即解离吸附或β-H提取步骤，存在持续的争论。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了我们设计催化剂和优化反应条件的方式。

文献讨论了不同形状的铂纳米粒子对PDH选择性和稳定性的影响。它指出，以Pt(1 1 1)表面为主的八面体颗粒比以Pt(1 0 0)表面为主的立方体颗粒具有更高的丙烯生产选择性和更好的稳定性。

文献解释了八面体颗粒中丙烯更高选择性产生是由于丙烯与Pt(1 1 1)表面之间的较弱结合强度和丙烯脱氢化过程中CH键断裂的能量壁垒增加。这导致深层脱氢中间体形成的可能性降低。此外，当焦炭在铂表面形成时，会导致催化剂失活，因为周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下移动更远。文献结论表示，其第一性原理计算为实验观察到的形状效应在PDH过程中的合理解释提供了依据。

金属颗粒的形状，特别是存在不同晶面如Pt(1 1 1)、Pt(1 0 0)和Pt(2 1 1)，显著影响PDH的催化活性和选择性。通过优化颗粒形状，研究人员可以提高PDH过程的效率。
