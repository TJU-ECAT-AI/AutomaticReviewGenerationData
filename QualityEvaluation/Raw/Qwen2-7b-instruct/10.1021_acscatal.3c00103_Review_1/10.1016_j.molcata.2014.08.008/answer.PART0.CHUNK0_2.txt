[1] "In this contribution, propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles of different shapes is investigated by a combination of experiments and DFT calculations."
[2] "Octahedral particles (12.0 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface have higher selectivity toward propylene production and better stability than cubic particles (11.5 nm) that are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface."
[3] "Combined experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(2 1 1) contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene by lowering the formation possibility of the deeply dehydrogenated intermediates."
[4] "When coke is formed on the Pt surface, the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms is shifted farther below the Fermi level, leading to the deactivation of Pt catalyst."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact sequence of these steps and their relative rates are subjects of ongoing debate in the scientific community. The dissociative adsorption step, where propane molecules are split into fragments on the catalyst surface, is considered by some to be the rate-limiting step due to its ability to create reactive species that can undergo further reactions. However, others argue that the β-H extraction, where hydrogen is removed from one of the resulting fragments, might be the rate-determining step as it can lead to the formation of propylene or other products. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects how we optimize catalysts for maximum efficiency and selectivity. The role of surface facets in shaping the reaction pathway and product distribution, as seen in the study of Pt particles of different shapes, provides insights into how to tailor catalysts for better performance. The study also suggests that the stability of the catalyst is influenced by the formation of coke on the surface, which can alter the electronic structure of the Pt atoms, leading to deactivation.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷裂解（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：脱吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱吸附。这些步骤的顺序及其相对速率是科学界持续辩论的主题。有人认为，脱吸附吸附步骤可能是决定性步骤，因为它能够产生反应活性物种，进而引发进一步反应。然而，另一些人则认为，β-H提取步骤可能更为关键，因为它可以导致丙烯或其他产物的形成。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它关系到如何优化催化剂以实现更高的效率和选择性。研究中关于不同形状铂颗粒的表面效应提供了调整催化剂性能以提高性能的见解。研究还表明，催化剂的稳定性受到表面焦炭形成的影晌，这可以改变铂原子的电子结构，导致催化剂失效。
