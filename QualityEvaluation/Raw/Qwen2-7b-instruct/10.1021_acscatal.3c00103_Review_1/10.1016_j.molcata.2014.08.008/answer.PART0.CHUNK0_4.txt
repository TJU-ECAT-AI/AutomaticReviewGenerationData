The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The controversy lies in identifying which step is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface is the rate-controlling step, while others propose that the β-H extraction step is more critical. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process because it affects how we predict and optimize the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The document does not directly address the ongoing debate or the impact of this uncertainty on PDH understanding.

In the context of the Pt-catalyzed PDH, the document highlights that the shape of the Pt particles significantly influences the catalytic performance. Cubic particles, which are predominantly covered by the Pt(1 0 0) surface, exhibit lower selectivity towards propylene production compared to octahedral particles. These octahedral particles, with a dominant Pt(1 1 1) surface, show both higher selectivity and better stability in PDH. The DFT calculations suggest that the weaker binding strength of propylene on the Pt(1 1 1) surface and the increased energy barrier for CH bond cleavage during the propylene dehydrogenation process contribute to the enhanced selectivity towards propylene. Moreover, the formation of coke on the Pt surface leads to the deactivation of the catalyst due to the shift of the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms below the Fermi level, further impacting the catalytic activity.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关键过程，包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。争议在于确定哪个步骤是速率控制步骤。一些研究人员认为，丙烷分子在催化剂表面的解离吸附是控制速率的步骤，而另一些人则认为β-H提取步骤更为关键。这种不确定性使我们对PDH过程的理解复杂化，因为它影响我们预测和优化反应动力学和产物选择性的能力。

在铂催化PDH的背景下，文档强调了铂粒子形状对催化性能的影响。立方形颗粒，主要覆盖有Pt(1 0 0)表面，表现出较低的丙烯生成选择性，与之相比，八面体颗粒具有较高的选择性和更好的稳定性。这些八面体颗粒，以主导Pt(1 1 1)表面为主，通过减弱丙烯在Pt(1 1 1)表面的结合强度和提高丙烯脱氢过程中CH键断裂的能量壁垒，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。此外，铂表面的焦炭形成导致催化剂活性下降，由于周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下移动，进一步影响催化活性。

文档没有直接讨论持续的争论或这一不确定性对PDH理解的影响。
