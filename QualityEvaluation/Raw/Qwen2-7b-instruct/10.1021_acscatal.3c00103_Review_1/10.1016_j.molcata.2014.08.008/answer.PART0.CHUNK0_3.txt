[1] "Shaped metal particles are known to possess distinct catalytic properties, which is often attributed to the catalytic activities of different particle facets."
[2] "The selectivity toward propylene and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation can be enhanced by shaping Pt nanoparticles under industrially relevant conditions."
[3] "Octahedral particles (12.0 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface have higher selectivity toward propylene production and better stability than cubic particles (11.5 nm) that are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface."
[4] "Combined experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(2 1 1) contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene by lowering the formation possibility of the deeply dehydrogenated intermediates."
[5] "When coke is formed on the Pt surface, the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms is shifted farther below the Fermi level, leading to the deactivation of Pt catalyst."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where a molecule is split upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed species. Desorption is the release of the product from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is more crucial. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The literature suggests that the shape of the metal particles, specifically octahedral particles dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface, enhance the selectivity towards propylene production due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage, which reduces the formation of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates. Furthermore, when coke forms on the Pt surface, it leads to the deactivation of the catalyst by shifting the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms farther below the Fermi level.

逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：吸附离化、β-H提取和脱附。吸附离化指的是分子在催化剂表面吸附时被分裂的过程。β-H提取是指从吸附物种中移除氢原子的过程。脱附是从表面释放产物的过程。关于速率控制步骤的争论集中在是吸附离化还是β-H提取更为关键。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和选择性。文献表明，金属颗粒的形状，特别是以Pt(1 1 1)表面为主的八面体颗粒，通过减弱丙烯的结合强度和提高丙烯脱氢时CH键断裂的能量壁垒，增强了丙烯生成的选择性，从而减少了深度脱氢中间体的形成。此外，当焦炭在Pt表面形成时，它通过使周围Pt原子的d带向费米能级以下移动更远，导致催化剂失效。
