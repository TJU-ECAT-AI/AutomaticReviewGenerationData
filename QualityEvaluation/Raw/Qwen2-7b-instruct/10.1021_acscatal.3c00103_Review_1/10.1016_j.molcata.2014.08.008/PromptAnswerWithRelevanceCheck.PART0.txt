The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism suggests that propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface, followed by the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H) from the adsorbed propane molecule, resulting in the formation of propylene. The ongoing debate in the field centers around whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the conversion from propane to propylene.

The document investigates the effect of particle shape on the catalytic activity of Pt particles in propane dehydrogenation. It was found that octahedral particles, which predominantly have the Pt(1 1 1) surface, exhibit higher selectivity towards propylene production and better stability compared to cubic particles, which are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface. The enhanced selectivity towards propylene is attributed to the weakened binding strength of propylene and the increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, which lowers the formation possibility of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates.

When coke forms on the Pt surface, the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms shifts farther below the Fermi level, leading to the deactivation of the Pt catalyst. This provides a rational interpretation of the experimental observations regarding the shape effects on propane dehydrogenation, as the particle shape influences the surface chemistry and, consequently, the catalytic activity and stability of the Pt catalyst.

该论文研究了不同形状的铂粒子在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的催化性能，结合实验和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。发现八面体颗粒，其表面主要为Pt(1 1 1)，在丙烯生产选择性和稳定性方面优于立方颗粒，立方颗粒表面主要为Pt(1 0 0)。增强的选择性向丙烯生产是由减弱的丙烯结合强度和丙烯脱氢化过程中Pt(1 1 1)相对于Pt(1 0 0)和Pt(2 1 1)表面的CH键断裂能垒增加所导致的，这降低了深度脱氢中间体形成的可能性。

当焦炭形成在铂表面时，周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下移动，导致铂催化剂失活。这为实验观察到的形状对丙烷脱氢作用提供了合理的解释，因为颗粒形状影响表面化学性质，并进而影响铂催化剂的活性和稳定性。

关于PDH过程的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及三个关键步骤：吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在这一反应中，关于吸附过程或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了从丙烷到丙烯的转化效率和选择性。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism suggests that propane molecules adsorb onto the surface of the catalyst, followed by the removal of a hydrogen atom (β-H extraction) from the propane molecule to form propylene. The product propylene then desorbs from the surface. 

The ongoing debate in the field revolves around whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction step is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences how we design catalysts and optimize reaction conditions. The document discusses the effect of shaping Pt nanoparticles on the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in PDH. It highlights that octahedral particles, dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface, exhibit higher selectivity towards propylene production and better stability compared to cubic particles, which are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface.

The document explains that the higher selectivity of octahedral particles towards propylene production is due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. This results in a lower formation possibility of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates. Additionally, when coke is formed on the Pt surface, it leads to the deactivation of the catalyst, as the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms shifts farther below the Fermi level. The document concludes with the statement that its DFT calculations provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observations regarding the shape effects on PDH.

The shape of the metal particles, specifically the presence of different facets like Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 0 0), and Pt(2 1 1), significantly influences the catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH. By optimizing the particle shape, researchers can enhance the efficiency of the PDH process.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个连续步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制表明，丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附，随后从丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子（β-H提取）形成丙烯。产物丙烯然后从表面脱附。

关于PDH过程中哪一步是控制速率的步骤，即解离吸附或β-H提取步骤，存在持续的争论。这一不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了我们设计催化剂和优化反应条件的方式。

文献讨论了不同形状的铂纳米粒子对PDH选择性和稳定性的影响。它指出，以Pt(1 1 1)表面为主的八面体颗粒比以Pt(1 0 0)表面为主的立方体颗粒具有更高的丙烯生产选择性和更好的稳定性。

文献解释了八面体颗粒中丙烯更高选择性产生是由于丙烯与Pt(1 1 1)表面之间的较弱结合强度和丙烯脱氢化过程中CH键断裂的能量壁垒增加。这导致深层脱氢中间体形成的可能性降低。此外，当焦炭在铂表面形成时，会导致催化剂失活，因为周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下移动更远。文献结论表示，其第一性原理计算为实验观察到的形状效应在PDH过程中的合理解释提供了依据。

金属颗粒的形状，特别是存在不同晶面如Pt(1 1 1)、Pt(1 0 0)和Pt(2 1 1)，显著影响PDH的催化活性和选择性。通过优化颗粒形状，研究人员可以提高PDH过程的效率。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact sequence of these steps and their relative rates are subjects of ongoing debate in the scientific community. The dissociative adsorption step, where propane molecules are split into fragments on the catalyst surface, is considered by some to be the rate-limiting step due to its ability to create reactive species that can undergo further reactions. However, others argue that the β-H extraction, where hydrogen is removed from one of the resulting fragments, might be the rate-determining step as it can lead to the formation of propylene or other products. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects how we optimize catalysts for maximum efficiency and selectivity. The role of surface facets in shaping the reaction pathway and product distribution, as seen in the study of Pt particles of different shapes, provides insights into how to tailor catalysts for better performance. The study also suggests that the stability of the catalyst is influenced by the formation of coke on the surface, which can alter the electronic structure of the Pt atoms, leading to deactivation.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where a molecule is split upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed species. Desorption is the release of the product from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is more crucial. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The literature suggests that the shape of the metal particles, specifically octahedral particles dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface, enhance the selectivity towards propylene production due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage, which reduces the formation of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates. Furthermore, when coke forms on the Pt surface, it leads to the deactivation of the catalyst by shifting the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms farther below the Fermi level.

逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：吸附离化、β-H提取和脱附。吸附离化指的是分子在催化剂表面吸附时被分裂的过程。β-H提取是指从吸附物种中移除氢原子的过程。脱附是从表面释放产物的过程。关于速率控制步骤的争论集中在是吸附离化还是β-H提取更为关键。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和选择性。文献表明，金属颗粒的形状，特别是以Pt(1 1 1)表面为主的八面体颗粒，通过减弱丙烯的结合强度和提高丙烯脱氢时CH键断裂的能量壁垒，增强了丙烯生成的选择性，从而减少了深度脱氢中间体的形成。此外，当焦炭在Pt表面形成时，它通过使周围Pt原子的d带向费米能级以下移动更远，导致催化剂失效。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The controversy lies in identifying which step is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface is the rate-controlling step, while others propose that the β-H extraction step is more critical. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process because it affects how we predict and optimize the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The document does not directly address the ongoing debate or the impact of this uncertainty on PDH understanding.

In the context of the Pt-catalyzed PDH, the document highlights that the shape of the Pt particles significantly influences the catalytic performance. Cubic particles, which are predominantly covered by the Pt(1 0 0) surface, exhibit lower selectivity towards propylene production compared to octahedral particles. These octahedral particles, with a dominant Pt(1 1 1) surface, show both higher selectivity and better stability in PDH. The DFT calculations suggest that the weaker binding strength of propylene on the Pt(1 1 1) surface and the increased energy barrier for CH bond cleavage during the propylene dehydrogenation process contribute to the enhanced selectivity towards propylene. Moreover, the formation of coke on the Pt surface leads to the deactivation of the catalyst due to the shift of the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms below the Fermi level, further impacting the catalytic activity.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关键过程，包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。争议在于确定哪个步骤是速率控制步骤。一些研究人员认为，丙烷分子在催化剂表面的解离吸附是控制速率的步骤，而另一些人则认为β-H提取步骤更为关键。这种不确定性使我们对PDH过程的理解复杂化，因为它影响我们预测和优化反应动力学和产物选择性的能力。

在铂催化PDH的背景下，文档强调了铂粒子形状对催化性能的影响。立方形颗粒，主要覆盖有Pt(1 0 0)表面，表现出较低的丙烯生成选择性，与之相比，八面体颗粒具有较高的选择性和更好的稳定性。这些八面体颗粒，以主导Pt(1 1 1)表面为主，通过减弱丙烯在Pt(1 1 1)表面的结合强度和提高丙烯脱氢过程中CH键断裂的能量壁垒，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。此外，铂表面的焦炭形成导致催化剂活性下降，由于周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下移动，进一步影响催化活性。

文档没有直接讨论持续的争论或这一不确定性对PDH理解的影响。
