The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The mechanism suggests that propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface, followed by the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H) from the adsorbed propane molecule, resulting in the formation of propylene. The ongoing debate in the field centers around whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the conversion from propane to propylene.

The document investigates the effect of particle shape on the catalytic activity of Pt particles in propane dehydrogenation. It was found that octahedral particles, which predominantly have the Pt(1 1 1) surface, exhibit higher selectivity towards propylene production and better stability compared to cubic particles, which are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface. The enhanced selectivity towards propylene is attributed to the weakened binding strength of propylene and the increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, which lowers the formation possibility of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates.

When coke forms on the Pt surface, the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms shifts farther below the Fermi level, leading to the deactivation of the Pt catalyst. This provides a rational interpretation of the experimental observations regarding the shape effects on propane dehydrogenation, as the particle shape influences the surface chemistry and, consequently, the catalytic activity and stability of the Pt catalyst.

该论文研究了不同形状的铂粒子在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的催化性能，结合实验和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。发现八面体颗粒，其表面主要为Pt(1 1 1)，在丙烯生产选择性和稳定性方面优于立方颗粒，立方颗粒表面主要为Pt(1 0 0)。增强的选择性向丙烯生产是由减弱的丙烯结合强度和丙烯脱氢化过程中Pt(1 1 1)相对于Pt(1 0 0)和Pt(2 1 1)表面的CH键断裂能垒增加所导致的，这降低了深度脱氢中间体形成的可能性。

当焦炭形成在铂表面时，周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下移动，导致铂催化剂失活。这为实验观察到的形状对丙烷脱氢作用提供了合理的解释，因为颗粒形状影响表面化学性质，并进而影响铂催化剂的活性和稳定性。

关于PDH过程的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及三个关键步骤：吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在这一反应中，关于吸附过程或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了从丙烷到丙烯的转化效率和选择性。
