The structure-performance relationship is a critical fundamental issue in heterogeneous catalysis, and the size-dependent structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions has long been researched in catalysis.
Yet it remains elusive for most of the reactions in a full-size range, from a single atom and subnanometer clusters to nanoparticles.
Herein, we report complete size dependence of Pt catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability due to coke formation.
The turnover frequency (TOF) of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the subnanometer-sized clusters and the nanoparticles, respectively.
A canyon- shaped size dependence of the propene selectivity was observed with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size.
The subnanometer-sized clusters have opposite size dependence of the propene selectivity compared to nanoparticles.
Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles possess high propene selectivity.
The atomically dispersed platinum centers with a positive charge dramatically enhanced the activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented its deep dehydrogenation.
Besides, the absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions (e.g., CC cracking), thus improved propylene selectivity and stability.
This work demonstrates the promising application of a supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst for highly selective dehydrogenation of propane.

Answer: The size dependence of Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was thoroughly investigated. The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated the highest activity, selectivity, and stability. The turnover frequency (TOF) was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than subnanometer-sized clusters and nanoparticles, respectively. The propene selectivity exhibited a canyon-shaped size dependence with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size. Atomically dispersed Pt centers with a positive charge significantly enhanced activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented deep dehydrogenation. The absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions, thereby improving propylene selectivity and stability. This research highlights the potential of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts for highly selective propane dehydrogenation.

对于丙烷脱氢反应中铂催化剂的尺寸依赖性进行了全面研究。原子分散的铂/氧化铝催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出最高性能。其转速频率（TOF）分别是纳米级簇和纳米粒子的约3倍和7倍。丙烯选择性的尺寸依赖性呈现出峡谷形状，底部位于大约2nm的铂颗粒大小。小于1nm的纳米级簇与较大的纳米颗粒相比，在丙烯选择性上表现出相反的趋势。原子分散的铂中心带有正电荷，显著提高了活性，减弱了丙烯的吸附，并阻止了其深度脱氢。此外，缺乏多个PtPt位点有效地抑制了不必要的副反应（如碳碳裂解），从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。这项研究强调了原子分散铂催化剂在高度选择性丙烷脱氢中的潜在应用。
