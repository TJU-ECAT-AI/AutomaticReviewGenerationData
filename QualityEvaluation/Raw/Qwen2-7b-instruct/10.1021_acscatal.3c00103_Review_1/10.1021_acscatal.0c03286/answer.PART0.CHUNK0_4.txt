[1] "The structure-performance relationship is a critical fundamental issue in heterogeneous catalysis, and the size-dependent structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions has long been researched in catalysis."
[2] "The size dependence of the propene selectivity was observed with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size."
[3] "Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles possess high propene selectivity."
[4] "The atomically dispersed platinum centers with a positive charge dramatically enhanced the activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented its deep dehydrogenation."
[5] "Besides, the absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions (e.g., CC cracking), thus improved propylene selectivity and stability."
[6] "This work demonstrates the promising application of a supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst for highly selective dehydrogenation of propane."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate about which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of PDH because it influences how we design catalysts. The literature suggests that the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst offers superior performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The atomically dispersed Pt centers with a positive charge enhance activity by weakening propylene adsorption and preventing deep dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibits undesired side reactions like CC cracking, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪个步骤是控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH的理解，因为它影响了我们如何设计催化剂。文献表明，原子分散的Pt/Al2O3催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出优异性能。原子分散的Pt中心带有正电荷，通过减弱丙烯的吸附并防止深度脱氢来增强活性。此外，缺乏多个PtPt位点有效地抑制了如CC裂解等不希望的副反应，从而提高了丙烯的选择性和稳定性。
