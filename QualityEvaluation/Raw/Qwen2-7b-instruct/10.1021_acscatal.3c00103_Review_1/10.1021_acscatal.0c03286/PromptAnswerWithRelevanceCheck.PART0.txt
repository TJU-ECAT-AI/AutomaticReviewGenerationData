The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The exact order of these steps and which one acts as the rate-controlling step is a subject of debate in the field. The uncertainty surrounding this debate impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects how the reaction dynamics are modeled and optimized for industrial applications. Specifically, if dissociative adsorption is the rate-controlling step, then enhancing the adsorption efficiency could lead to increased catalytic activity. Conversely, if β-H extraction is the rate-limiting step, improving the catalyst's ability to extract hydrogen from the adsorbed propane molecules would be crucial for achieving higher selectivity towards propylene. The precise mechanism would influence the design of catalysts and the operational conditions to maximize the yield of propylene and minimize the formation of unwanted byproducts.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate over whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step influences our understanding of the PDH process. Uncertainty in this area impacts the optimization of catalytic activity and selectivity. Depending on the rate-controlling step, enhancing adsorption efficiency or improving β-H extraction capabilities could be key strategies for increasing propylene yield and minimizing byproduct formation. The exact mechanism determines the focus of catalyst design and operational parameters for achieving optimal PDH performance.

The structure-performance relationship is a critical fundamental issue in heterogeneous catalysis, and the size-dependent structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions has long been researched in catalysis.
Yet it remains elusive for most of the reactions in a full-size range, from a single atom and subnanometer clusters to nanoparticles.
Herein, we report complete size dependence of Pt catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability due to coke formation.
The turnover frequency (TOF) of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the subnanometer-sized clusters and the nanoparticles, respectively.
A canyon- shaped size dependence of the propene selectivity was observed with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size.
The subnanometer-sized clusters have opposite size dependence of the propene selectivity compared to nanoparticles.
Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles possess high propene selectivity.
The atomically dispersed platinum centers with a positive charge dramatically enhanced the activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented its deep dehydrogenation.
Besides, the absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions (e.g., CC cracking), thus improved propylene selectivity and stability.

The atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated the highest activity, selectivity, and stability. The turnover frequency (TOF) was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than subnanometer-sized clusters and nanoparticles, respectively. The propene selectivity exhibited a canyon-shaped size dependence with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size. Atomically dispersed Pt centers with a positive charge significantly enhanced activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented deep dehydrogenation. The absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions, thereby improving propylene selectivity and stability.

对于丙烷脱氢反应中铂催化剂的尺寸依赖性进行了全面研究。原子分散的铂/氧化铝催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出最高性能。其转速频率（TOF）分别是纳米级簇和纳米粒子的约3倍和7倍。丙烯选择性的尺寸依赖性呈现出峡谷形状，底部位于大约2nm的铂颗粒大小。小于1nm的纳米级簇与较大的纳米颗粒相比，在丙烯选择性上表现出相反的趋势。原子分散的铂中心带有正电荷，显著提高了活性，减弱了丙烯的吸附，并阻止了其深度脱氢。此外，缺乏多个PtPt位点有效地抑制了不必要的副反应（如碳碳裂解），从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。这项研究强调了原子分散铂催化剂在高度选择性丙烷脱氢中的潜在应用。

The structure-performance relationship is a critical fundamental issue in heterogeneous catalysis, and the size-dependent structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions has long been researched in catalysis. Yet it remains elusive for most of the reactions in a full-size range, from a single atom and subnanometer clusters to nanoparticles.
The size dependence of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be categorized into three regions. In the first region, the atomically dispersed 0.05% Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts have the highest activity, propene selectivity, and stability for propane conversion, where TOF reaches 4.65 and 4.25 s−1, respectively.
Clearly, as the Pt loading decreases, a shift of the Pt 4d5/2 B.E. toward higher values occurred and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species gradually increased. The results demonstrate a stronger interaction, which gradually grows with decreasing the Pt loading between Pt and supports. The Pt particles in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 can transfer an additional charge to the support compared to 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3; this implies that the atomically dispersed Pt atoms contain more positive charges than small clusters and nanoparticles.
Furthermore, a kinetic study was performed to elucidate the size dependence of the kinetic behaviors and the Arrhenius plots for PDH on the atomically dispersed Pt (0.1% Pt/Al2O3), small clusters (0.3% Pt/Al2O3), and nanoparticles (3% Pt/Al2O3), and the results are shown in Figure 5.
The weight loss of the spent 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is the lowest (ca. 1.5 wt %) in the O2 atmosphere, and the difference of weight loss between O2 and N2 is negligible.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism suggests that propane molecules first dissociate upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface, followed by the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H) from the resulting alkyl radical. Finally, the alkyl radical is removed from the surface as propylene. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH has persisted because both processes are energetically favorable and could potentially limit the reaction rate. The uncertainty about which step is rate-limiting influences our understanding of the PDH process, particularly in terms of how the catalyst surface chemistry affects the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The study demonstrates that atomically dispersed platinum catalysts exhibit the best catalytic performance for PDH, with high activity and selectivity, and they are capable of efficiently enhancing propane adsorption and facilitating CH bond activation compared to smaller clusters and nanoparticles. This is attributed to the positive charges on the Ptδ+ centers, which favor the preferential adsorption of propane and prevent its over-dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites on the atomically dispersed Pt catalyst effectively inhibits undesirable side reactions, such as cracking, thereby improving propylene selectivity and stability. The systematic exploration of the size dependence of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH provides insights into optimizing catalyst design for industrial applications with minimal use of noble metals.

反霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关键步骤，涉及三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制认为，丙烷分子首先在催化剂表面解离，随后从形成的烷基自由基中提取一个氢原子（β-H）。最后，从表面去除烷基自由基生成丙烯。关于PDH中是否是解离吸附还是β-H提取为速率控制步骤的争论持续存在，因为这两个过程都是能量有利的，并且都可能限制反应速率。关于哪个步骤是速率限制因素的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，特别是在催化剂表面化学如何影响反应动力学和产物选择性方面。研究表明，原子分散的铂催化剂在PDH过程中表现出最佳的催化性能，具有高活性和选择性，并且能够高效地增强丙烷吸附和促进CH键活化，与较小的簇和纳米粒子相比。这归因于Ptδ+中心上的正电荷，这些电荷有利于丙烷的优先吸附并防止其过度脱氢。此外，原子分散的铂催化剂上不存在多个Pt-Pt位点，有效地抑制了裂解等不希望的副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。对Pt/Al2O3催化剂尺寸依赖性的系统探索为优化工业应用中的催化剂设计提供了洞察力，同时最小化了贵金属的使用。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the separation of propane molecules into their constituent parts, β-H extraction entails the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, and desorption is the release of the resulting propylene molecule back into the gas phase. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because the rate-controlling step determines the overall speed of the reaction. If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, it suggests that the process of breaking the propane molecule into individual parts is the most time-consuming aspect of the reaction. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, it implies that extracting a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule is the most time-consuming step. This uncertainty complicates the optimization of PDH processes, as understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts used in these reactions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及将丙烷分子分解成其组成部分，β-H提取指的是从吸附的丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子，脱附是将生成的丙烯分子释放回气相的过程。关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的持续争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为控制步骤决定了反应的整体速度。如果解离吸附是控制步骤，这意味着分解丙烷分子的过程是最耗时的部分。相反，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，则意味着从吸附的丙烷分子中提取氢原子是最耗时的步骤。这种不确定性使优化PDH过程变得复杂，理解控制步骤对于提高催化剂在这些反应中的效率和选择性至关重要。
