[1] "The catalytic performance of a catalyst generally depends on the geometric and electronic structures of active sites."
[2] "The superior catalytic activity of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 is attributable to the exposure of increased effective active sites, positively charged Ptδ+ centers."
[3] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the separation of propane molecules into their constituent parts, β-H extraction entails the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, and desorption is the release of the resulting propylene molecule back into the gas phase. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because the rate-controlling step determines the overall speed of the reaction. If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, it suggests that the process of breaking the propane molecule into individual parts is the most time-consuming aspect of the reaction. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, it implies that extracting a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule is the most time-consuming step. This uncertainty complicates the optimization of PDH processes, as understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts used in these reactions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及将丙烷分子分解成其组成部分，β-H提取指的是从吸附的丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子，脱附是将生成的丙烯分子释放回气相的过程。关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的持续争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为控制步骤决定了反应的整体速度。如果解离吸附是控制步骤，这意味着分解丙烷分子的过程是最耗时的部分。相反，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，则意味着从吸附的丙烷分子中提取氢原子是最耗时的步骤。这种不确定性使优化PDH过程变得复杂，理解控制步骤对于提高催化剂在这些反应中的效率和选择性至关重要。
