The structure-performance relationship is a critical fundamental issue in heterogeneous catalysis, and the size-dependent structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions has long been researched in catalysis. Yet it remains elusive for most of the reactions in a full-size range, from a single atom and subnanometer clusters to nanoparticles.
The size dependence of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be categorized into three regions. In the first region, the atomically dispersed 0.05% Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts have the highest activity, propene selectivity, and stability for propane conversion, where TOF reaches 4.65 and 4.25 s−1, respectively.
Clearly, as the Pt loading decreases, a shift of the Pt 4d5/2 B.E. toward higher values occurred and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species gradually increased. The results demonstrate a stronger interaction, which gradually grows with decreasing the Pt loading between Pt and supports. The Pt particles in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 can transfer an additional charge to the support compared to 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3; this implies that the atomically dispersed Pt atoms contain more positive charges than small clusters and nanoparticles.
Furthermore, a kinetic study was performed to elucidate the size dependence of the kinetic behaviors and the Arrhenius plots for PDH on the atomically dispersed Pt (0.1% Pt/Al2O3), small clusters (0.3% Pt/Al2O3), and nanoparticles (3% Pt/Al2O3), and the results are shown in Figure 5.
The weight loss of the spent 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is the lowest (ca. 1.5 wt %) in the O2 atmosphere, and the difference of weight loss between O2 and N2 is negligible.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism suggests that propane molecules first dissociate upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface, followed by the extraction of a hydrogen atom (β-H) from the resulting alkyl radical. Finally, the alkyl radical is removed from the surface as propylene. The debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH has persisted because both processes are energetically favorable and could potentially limit the reaction rate. The uncertainty about which step is rate-limiting influences our understanding of the PDH process, particularly in terms of how the catalyst surface chemistry affects the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The study demonstrates that atomically dispersed platinum catalysts exhibit the best catalytic performance for PDH, with high activity and selectivity, and they are capable of efficiently enhancing propane adsorption and facilitating CH bond activation compared to smaller clusters and nanoparticles. This is attributed to the positive charges on the Ptδ+ centers, which favor the preferential adsorption of propane and prevent its over-dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites on the atomically dispersed Pt catalyst effectively inhibits undesirable side reactions, such as cracking, thereby improving propylene selectivity and stability. The systematic exploration of the size dependence of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH provides insights into optimizing catalyst design for industrial applications with minimal use of noble metals.

反霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关键步骤，涉及三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。该机制认为，丙烷分子首先在催化剂表面解离，随后从形成的烷基自由基中提取一个氢原子（β-H）。最后，从表面去除烷基自由基生成丙烯。关于PDH中是否是解离吸附还是β-H提取为速率控制步骤的争论持续存在，因为这两个过程都是能量有利的，并且都可能限制反应速率。关于哪个步骤是速率限制因素的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，特别是在催化剂表面化学如何影响反应动力学和产物选择性方面。研究表明，原子分散的铂催化剂在PDH过程中表现出最佳的催化性能，具有高活性和选择性，并且能够高效地增强丙烷吸附和促进CH键活化，与较小的簇和纳米粒子相比。这归因于Ptδ+中心上的正电荷，这些电荷有利于丙烷的优先吸附并防止其过度脱氢。此外，原子分散的铂催化剂上不存在多个Pt-Pt位点，有效地抑制了裂解等不希望的副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性。对Pt/Al2O3催化剂尺寸依赖性的系统探索为优化工业应用中的催化剂设计提供了洞察力，同时最小化了贵金属的使用。
