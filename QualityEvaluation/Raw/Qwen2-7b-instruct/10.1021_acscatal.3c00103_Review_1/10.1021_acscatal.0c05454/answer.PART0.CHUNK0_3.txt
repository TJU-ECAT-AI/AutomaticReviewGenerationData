[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "The ongoing debate centers on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH."
[3] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of catalysts used in this reaction."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate about which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty affects our comprehension of the PDH process, particularly concerning the efficiency and selectivity of catalysts employed in this reaction.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于这些步骤中哪一个——离解吸附或β-H提取——是控制速率的步骤，存在持续的争论。这一不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，特别是对于在该反应中使用的催化剂的效率和选择性的理解。
