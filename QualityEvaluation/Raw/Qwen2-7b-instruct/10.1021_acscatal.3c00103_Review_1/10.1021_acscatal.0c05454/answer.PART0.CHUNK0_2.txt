</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document focuses on the rational design of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It discusses the volcano plot, which is a graphical representation of the relationship between activity and selectivity in catalytic processes. This study aims to enhance the understanding and efficiency of PDH reactions through the strategic doping of single atoms into Ga2O3.

[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three stages: dissociative adsorption, where propane molecules detach from the catalyst surface; β-H extraction, involving the removal of hydrogen from the adsorbed propane molecules; and desorption, the release of the resulting products from the catalyst.
