The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Initially, propane molecules undergo dissociative adsorption, splitting into fragments upon interaction with a catalyst surface. This process is often viewed as the rate-controlling step. However, there is ongoing debate about whether the β-H extraction, which entails the removal of a hydrogen atom from the product molecule, truly acts as the rate-limiting step. This ambiguity complicates our understanding of the PDH process, particularly when it comes to optimizing catalyst design and enhancing reaction efficiency.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。首先，丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附并分裂成碎片。这一过程通常被认为是PDH的速率控制步骤。然而，关于是否β-H提取，即从产物分子中去除一个氢原子，实际上是决定速率的关键步骤，仍存在争议。这种不确定性使我们对PDH过程的理解复杂化，特别是在优化催化剂设计和提高反应效率方面。
