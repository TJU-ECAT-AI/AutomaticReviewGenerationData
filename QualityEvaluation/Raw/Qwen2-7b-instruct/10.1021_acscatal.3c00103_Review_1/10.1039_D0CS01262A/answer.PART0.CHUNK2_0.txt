[1] "It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism."
[2] "The dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene is shown in Fig. 28(a) (steps 14), and the energy barriers for these four steps can describe the catalytic activity of metal surfaces for propylene production."
[3] "Xiao et al.365 suggested that although PDH over Pt(111) follows the generally accepted reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, as shown in Fig. 29, an unexpected non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism over Pt(211) is proposed to dominate the kinetics."
[4] "The experimental354 and theoretical analyses of Gibbs energy profiles of the PDH reaction340,353 suggest that the first CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(211) and Pt(100) for smaller Pt cluster sizes, while the second CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(111)."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism is widely accepted for the dehydrogenation of propane over platinum catalysts. However, Xiao et al. proposed an unexpected non-reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH over Pt(211). This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process, particularly regarding which step is the rate-controlling step. The ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step affects the optimization of catalysts for PDH, as it guides the search for materials with the desired catalytic properties.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH），通常接受的反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。这种机制被广泛应用于铂催化剂上的丙烷脱氢。然而，Xiao等人提出了PDH在Pt(211)上的一个意外的非反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制。这一争议影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，特别是关于哪个步骤是控制步骤的问题。关于控制步骤的争议影响了PDH催化剂的优化，因为它指导着寻找具有所需催化性质材料的搜索。
