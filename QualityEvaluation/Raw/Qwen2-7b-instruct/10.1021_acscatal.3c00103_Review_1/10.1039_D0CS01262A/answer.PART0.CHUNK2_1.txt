[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a two-step process. It includes dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "Lowering the desorption energy and increasing the CH bond activation barrier of propylene are crucial for increasing the propylene selectivity."
[3] "The first CH bond activation is the RDS on the Pt(111) by a microkinetic analysis."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate regarding which step is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction controls the reaction rate affects the optimization of catalysts and the prediction of reaction kinetics. This ambiguity highlights the complexity of the PDH mechanism and the need for further research to clarify the rate-controlling step.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的两个步骤。它包括解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否控制反应速率的不确定性影响了催化剂的优化和反应动力学的预测。这种模糊性凸显了PDH机制的复杂性和进一步研究澄清速率控制步骤的必要性。
