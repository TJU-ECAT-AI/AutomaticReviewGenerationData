The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule is split into fragments upon contact with the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from one of these fragments, typically from a methyl or methylene group. Desorption then allows the resulting products, usually propylene, to leave the surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, the uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction rates and product yields. Different catalysts or reaction conditions might favor one step over the other, influencing the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction. This uncertainty necessitates further research to clarify the relative importance of these steps and optimize the PDH process accordingly.

The oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface modifies the electronic structure of active species and potentially alters the reaction mechanism. This effect is crucial for understanding how oxygen vacancies influence the PDH process. The presence of oxygen vacancies can enhance or inhibit certain reaction pathways, depending on their local structure and coordination.

The kinetic model for propane conversion includes multiple pathways, such as propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion. This model helps explain the complex interplay between different reaction mechanisms and their contributions to the overall yield of propylene. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for optimizing the PDH process and improving propylene production.

The activation energies for the formation of CO and CO2 from secondary propylene combustion are lower than those for propylene formation on TiO2/SiO2-supported VOx catalysts. This inverse relationship indicates that secondary reactions might dominate under certain conditions, affecting the conversion versus selectivity trade-off. This insight is critical for designing catalysts that balance efficiency and selectivity effectively.

The reaction rates on V2O5 powders and supported VOx are independent of the concentrations of propane, oxygen, and water, suggesting that both surfaces have similar active centers. This finding implies that the catalyst's activity is consistent across different conditions, facilitating the optimization of the PDH process.

The valence state of the catalyst plays a role in determining the PDH ability. The oxygen vacancy affects the electronic structure of active species, potentially altering the reaction mechanism and influencing the PDH process. Understanding the specific roles of oxygen vacancies in the PDH process is essential for improving catalyst design and performance.

The lattice oxygen facilitates propylene formation, providing pathways for desired product formation. Meanwhile, surface oxygen primarily leads to the formation of undesired COx species. Balancing these factors is crucial for achieving high propylene yields and selectivity in the PDH process.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时被分裂成片段的过程。β-H提取随后是从这些片段中抽取一个氢原子，通常是从甲基或亚甲基组中抽取。脱附允许产物，通常是丙烯，离开表面。

关于解离吸附或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论，这种不确定性影响了对PDH过程的理解，因为它使预测反应速率和产物产率变得更加复杂。在不同的催化剂或反应条件下，这些步骤可能受到不同的重视，这会影响PDH反应的整体效率和选择性。

氧空位在催化剂表面的出现修改了活性物种的电子结构，并有可能改变反应机制。这种效应对于理解氧空位如何影响PDH过程至关重要。氧空位的存在可以增强或抑制某些反应途径，具体取决于它们的局部结构和配位。

包含多个路径的亲核动力学模型，如丙烷ODH、并行丙烷燃烧和顺序丙烯燃烧，有助于解释不同反应机制之间的复杂相互作用及其对丙烯总产量的贡献。理解这些机制对于优化PDH过程和提高丙烯生产至关重要。

从二次丙烯燃烧形成的CO和CO2的活化能低于TiO2/SiO2支持的VOx催化剂上丙烯形成时的活化能。这种相反的关系表明，在某些条件下，次级反应可能会占主导地位，影响转化与选择性的权衡关系。这一见解对于设计平衡效率和选择性的催化剂非常重要。

V2O5粉末和支持的VOx的反应速率不受丙烷、氧气和水浓度的影响，这表明两者具有相似的活性中心。这一发现意味着催化剂的活性在不同条件下保持一致，有利于优化PDH过程。

催化剂的价态决定了PDH能力。氧空位影响了活性物种的电子结构，可能改变了反应机制，并影响了PDH过程。深入了解氧空位在PDH过程中的特定作用对于改进催化剂设计和性能至关重要。

在催化剂表面上的晶格氧促进了丙烯生成，提供了形成所需产品的途径。同时，表面氧主要导致形成不希望的COx物种。平衡这些因素对于实现高丙烯产率和选择性至关重要。
