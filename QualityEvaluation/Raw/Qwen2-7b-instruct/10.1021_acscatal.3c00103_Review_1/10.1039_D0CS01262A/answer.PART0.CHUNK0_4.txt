[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction."
[3] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation comprises three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-limiting step in this process. This ambiguity complicates our comprehension of the PDH mechanism.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于该反应中是离解吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论持续存在，这使我们对PDH过程的理解复杂化。
