[1] "The first CH bond activation might take place via three pathways, namely direct CH4 dissociation, O*-assisted CH4 dissociation, and OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation."
[2] "The activation barriers of O*-assisted CH4 dissociation were much higher than those of OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation, both higher than those of direct CH4 dissociation."
[3] "The direct CH4 dissociation was the energetically most favorable pathway on group 810 metals."
[4] "The preferred reaction pathways need to be determined based on the whole catalytic cycle."
[5] "The presence of O* or OH* will reduce the overall reaction rate since they will block active surface sites."
[6] "The Pt(111) surface is an exception, where the activation barrier for OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation was lower than those for the direct dissociation and the O*-assisted route."

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption is the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface by breaking one or more hydrogen bonds. β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, leading to the formation of propylene and hydrogen. Desorption is the final step where the propylene product is released from the surface. The ongoing debate revolves around whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. If dissociative adsorption is the rate-controlling step, the focus should be on optimizing the adsorption process. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, efforts should be directed towards enhancing the extraction mechanism. The correct identification of the rate-controlling step is crucial for the development of more efficient PDH catalysts.

该逆向Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是通过破坏一个或多个氢键将丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面的过程。β-H提取随后发生，从吸附的丙烷分子中抽取一个氢原子，形成丙烯和氢气。脱附是最后一步，从表面上释放出丙烯产物。关于是否解离吸附或β-H提取是PDH反应速率控制步骤的争论持续存在。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和选择性。如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，则应重点优化吸附过程。相反，如果β-H提取是速率控制步骤，则应致力于增强提取机制。正确识别速率控制步骤对于开发更高效的PDH催化剂至关重要。
