[1] "In addition to these studies, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst."
[2] "Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts; the effect is explained by a modification of the acidbase properties of the catalysts."
[3] "The initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides follows the same ODH mechanism as V-based catalysts in that lattice oxygens participate the CH activation."
[4] "However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations."
[5] "It has been illustrated that the oxygen vacancy modified the electronic structure of active species and even change the reaction mechanism."
[6] "Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion."
[7] "For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond between propane molecules, allowing them to attach to the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule adsorbed on the surface. Desorption refers to the release of the resulting propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate around which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step is ongoing. The uncertainty in this matter impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The presence of water at higher concentrations introduces a more complex dependence on propane and oxygen pressures, influencing the rates of the reaction. Oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface modify the electronic structure of active species and potentially alter the reaction mechanism. The propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion processes can collectively describe propane conversion and propylene yield. The energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced when the O2 molecule participates in the propane ODH reaction.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附涉及在催化剂表面吸附丙烷分子时，氢键的断裂。β-H提取步骤涉及从吸附在表面上的丙烷分子中去除一个氢原子。脱附指的是释放产物丙烯分子从催化剂表面。关于是解离吸附步骤还是β-H提取步骤是速率控制步骤的辩论正在进行中。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。水的存在在较高浓度下引入了对丙烷和氧气压力更复杂的依赖关系，影响了反应速率。催化剂表面的氧空位修改了活性物种的电子结构，甚至可能改变反应机制。丙烷脱氢、平行丙烷燃烧和顺序丙烯燃烧过程可以共同描述丙烷转化和丙烯产率。当O2分子参与丙烷脱氢反应时，表面水的消除能量壁垒可以降低。
