[1] "The advantage of this approach is that overoxidation of the reactants and products can be reduced and therefore the olefin selectivity can be enhanced."
[2] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species."
[3] "The most likely active sites over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts were further elucidated by the same group by combining in situ characterization with DFT calculations."
[4] "The first CH bond cleavage in ethane and ethylene was an irreversible and kinetically relevant step in ODH and combustion reactions."
[5] "The terminal O site exhibited a more favorable side reaction leading to acetaldehyde than to ethylene."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are split upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the resulting adsorbed intermediate. Desorption is the final step where the dehydrogenated product is released from the surface. The ongoing debate in the scientific community is whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH mechanism and the factors influencing its efficiency. The resolution of this debate could potentially lead to the development of more effective catalysts for PDH and improved selectivity towards the desired product, ethylene.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：离解吸附，β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附是指丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附并分裂的过程。β-H提取涉及从形成的吸附中间体中移除一个氢原子。脱附是最终步骤，在此步骤中，脱氢产物从表面释放。科学界对PDH过程中的控制步骤是在离解吸附或β-H提取之间存在争议。这种不确定性使我们对PDH机制的理解变得复杂，并影响其效率。解决这一争议可能有助于开发更有效的PDH催化剂和提高目标产品的选择性。
