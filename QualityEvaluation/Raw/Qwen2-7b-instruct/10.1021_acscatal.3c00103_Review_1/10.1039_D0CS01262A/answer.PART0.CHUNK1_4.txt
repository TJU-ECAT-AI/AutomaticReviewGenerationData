[1] "The exact reaction mechanism of dehydrogenation of ethane is still under debate, due to the fact that a large variety of materials can catalyze this reaction."
[2] "Both the dissociative adsorption of ethane and CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom275277 have been suggested as the RDSs."
[3] "The 4 step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is commonly used to describe the dehydrogenation mechanism on metal surfaces."
[4] "On the Pt surface, it is generally accepted that the reaction goes through ethane dehydrogenation to ethyl, CH3CH2*, then to ethylene, while the non-selective pathway to methane and deeply dehydrogenated species is predicted to go through dehydrogenation via CH3CH*."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step, where propane molecules are broken down into propane ions, is considered by some to be the rate-controlling step. Others argue that the β-H extraction step, where a hydrogen atom is removed from the β-position of a carbon-carbon bond, is the rate-limiting step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences the choice of catalyst and operating conditions for achieving optimal efficiency and selectivity. Different catalysts and conditions may favor one step over the other, affecting the overall yield of ethylene and minimizing unwanted byproducts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反霍里图-波兰尼机制包括三个步骤：解吸附吸附，β-H提取和脱附。有人认为解吸附吸附步骤是控制速率的关键步骤。其他人则认为β-H提取步骤，即从碳-碳键的β位置移除一个氢原子，是关键步骤。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响选择催化剂和操作条件以实现最佳效率和选择性。不同的催化剂和条件可能会偏向于一步而不是另一步，这会影响总的乙烯产率并最小化副产物。
