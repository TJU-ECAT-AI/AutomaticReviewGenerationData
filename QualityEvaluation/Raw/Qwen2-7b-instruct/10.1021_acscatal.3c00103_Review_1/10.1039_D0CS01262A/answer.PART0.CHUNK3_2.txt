In the initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, the most feasible reaction pathway is H abstraction by the terminal MoO site. The CH activation for methylene is 0.20 eV more favorable than that for the methyl CH bond.
On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O. Since it is also possible to generate gaseous H2O at high temperatures, the reaction would follow an ODH mechanism comprising H2O at the initial stage and follow a PDH mechanism forming H2 at the steady stage.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced. The rate of propane ODH reaction is proportional to C3H8 partial pressure and independent of O2 partial pressure in the limit of very low H2O concentrations.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are split upon contact with the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon compound. The debate surrounds whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. The uncertainty about this impacts our understanding of how propane efficiently converts to propylene on the catalyst surface. High temperatures enable the formation of H2O from OH groups, leading to an ODH mechanism initially. As the reaction progresses, a PDH mechanism takes over, facilitating the formation of H2.

逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附是指丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时被分裂的过程。β-H提取是从烃化合物中移除一个氢原子。争议围绕着离解吸附或β-H提取是否是PDH过程中的控制步骤。对这一点的不确定性影响了我们对如何在催化剂表面上高效将丙烷转化为丙烯的理解。高温使OH基团形成H2O，导致初始阶段采用氧化脱氢机制。随着反应的进行，逐步转换为脱氢化机制，促进H2的形成。
