[1] "The only feedstock that can achieve high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane."
[2] "To achieve high selectivity, the weakest CH or CC bond in the olefin has to be less than 0.31 eV weaker than the weakest CH bond in the reacting paraffin."
[3] "For propane and propylene, the weakest CH bond has a bond energy of 4.16 and 3.74 eV respectively."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This ambiguity arises due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and the competing mechanisms involved. The exact nature of the rate-controlling step influences the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process, which is crucial for optimizing the catalytic system. The debate over the rate-controlling step continues as researchers seek to unravel the intricate details of the PDH mechanism.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制包含三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性源于反应途径的复杂性和参与机制的竞争性。确定速率控制步骤的确切性质对于优化催化系统至关重要，因为它影响着脱氢过程的效率和选择性。PDH机制中的速率控制步骤的争论仍在继续，因为研究人员正在努力揭示这一过程的细节。
