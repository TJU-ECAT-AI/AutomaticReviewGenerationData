The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption process involves the propane molecule breaking apart upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. Subsequently, the β-H extraction step entails the removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed propane molecule, resulting in the formation of propene. The final desorption step sees the release of the propene molecule from the catalyst surface. There is a persisting debate in the scientific community regarding which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty significantly influences our comprehension of the PDH process, affecting the selection of catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions. Clarifying the rate-controlling step is paramount for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的三个连续步骤：离解吸附，β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附过程涉及丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附时分解。随后，β-H提取步骤涉及从吸附的丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子，形成丙烯。最后的脱附步骤看到丙烯分子从催化剂表面释放。关于这些步骤中的哪一个，离解吸附或β-H提取，作为PDH过程的速率控制步骤，在科学界存在持续的争议。这种不确定性显著影响我们对PDH过程的理解，影响催化剂的选择和反应条件的优化。澄清速率控制步骤对于提高PDH过程的效率和选择性至关重要。
