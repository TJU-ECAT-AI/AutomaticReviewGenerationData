[1] "The only feedstock that can achieve high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane."
[2] "To achieve high selectivity, the weakest CH or CC bond in the olefin has to be less than 0.31 eV weaker than the weakest CH bond in the reacting paraffin."
[3] "That is, the lattice oxygen of metal oxides interacts with hydrocarbons to form oxygen vacancies (eqn (9)), followed by the regeneration process (eqn (10))."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This debate arises because both steps contribute significantly to the overall reaction rate, making it challenging to determine which step is truly rate-limiting. This uncertainty influences the design of catalysts and reaction conditions for PDH, as optimizing either step can lead to improvements in the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反霍里图-波拉尼机制包括三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否为控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种争议源于这两个步骤都对总反应速率有重大贡献，使得确定哪个步骤真正为控制步骤变得困难。这种不确定性影响了PDH过程的催化剂设计和条件优化，因为优化这两个步骤中的任何一个都可以提高过程的效率和选择性。
