[1] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period."
[2] "The initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides follows the same ODH mechanism as V-based catalysts in that lattice oxygens participate the CH activation."
[3] "For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced."
[4] "Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion."
[5] "The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules break apart upon contacting the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane fragment, leading to the formation of propylene. Desorption is the final step, where the propylene molecule is released from the surface.

Regarding the debate on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, the literature does not definitively resolve this issue. However, it is noted that the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced during the propane ODH reaction, suggesting that the involvement of water might influence the reaction kinetics. The dependency of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations being identical across different surfaces indicates that both surfaces have similar active centers, which might influence the overall reaction rates. 

The uncertainty around which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the most influential factors that determine the efficiency of the reaction. This ambiguity requires further investigation to clarify the relative contributions of each step and to optimize the catalyst design for enhanced propylene production.

The ongoing debate on the rate-controlling step in the PDH process highlights the importance of understanding the detailed mechanisms of the reaction. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient catalysts with improved selectivity and activity, ultimately leading to better processes for converting propane to propylene.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指丙烷分子在接触催化剂表面时分解的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从吸附的丙烷片段中抽象出一个氢原子，形成丙烯。脱附是最后一步，丙烯分子从表面释放。

关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是决定性步骤的争论，文献没有明确解决这一问题。然而，指出在丙烷ODH反应过程中水的消除能量壁垒可以降低，表明水的参与可能会影响反应动力学。不同表面上反应速率对C3H8、O2和H2O浓度的依赖性相同，表明两个表面具有相似的活性中心，这可能影响整体反应速率。

解离吸附过程或β-H提取是决定性步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定反应效率的关键因素变得更加复杂。这种模糊性需要进一步研究来澄清每个步骤的相对贡献，并指导催化剂设计以提高丙烯产量。

PDH过程的持续争论突出了理解反应详细机制的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，具有改进的选择性和活性，最终导致更好的丙烷转化为丙烯过程。
