The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step involves the separation of propane molecules into smaller fragments upon contact with the catalyst surface. Following this, the β-H extraction step occurs, where a hydrogen atom is removed from one of the resulting fragments, typically from a methyl or methylene group. The final step, desorption, entails the release of the resulting product, usually propylene, from the catalyst surface. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction has significant implications for our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty surrounding this issue impacts the optimization of catalytic conditions, the prediction of product yields, and the development of more efficient catalysts. The choice between these two steps being rate-limiting can guide the design of catalysts and the selection of operating parameters to maximize propylene production while minimizing unwanted side reactions and byproducts.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个连续步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解吸附吸附步骤涉及在催化剂表面与丙烷分子接触后，将丙烷分子分解成更小的片段。随后发生β-H提取步骤，从一个生成的片段中去除一个氢原子，通常是从甲基或亚甲基基团。最后一步，脱附，是指从催化剂表面释放产物，通常是丙烯。关于解吸附吸附过程或β-H提取是否是速率控制步骤的持续争论对理解PDH过程具有重大影响。这个不确定性影响了催化条件的优化、产品产率的预测以及高效催化剂的发展。选择这两个步骤中哪一个是限速步骤可以指导催化剂的设计并选择操作参数以最大化丙烯生产同时减少不需要的副反应和副产品。
