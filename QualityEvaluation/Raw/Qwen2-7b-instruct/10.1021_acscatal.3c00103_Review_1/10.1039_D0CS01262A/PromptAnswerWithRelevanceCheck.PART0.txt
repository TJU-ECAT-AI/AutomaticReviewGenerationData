The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the breaking of a hydrogen bond between propane molecules, allowing them to attach to the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule adsorbed on the surface. Desorption refers to the release of the resulting propylene molecule from the catalyst surface. The debate around which step, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step is ongoing. The uncertainty in this matter impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The presence of water at higher concentrations introduces a more complex dependence on propane and oxygen pressures, influencing the rates of the reaction. Oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface modify the electronic structure of active species and potentially alter the reaction mechanism. The propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion processes can collectively describe propane conversion and propylene yield. The energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced when the O2 molecule participates in the propane ODH reaction.

</ChineseVersionAnswer>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the separation of propane molecules from the surface of a catalyst, exposing the carbon-carbon (C-C) bond for reaction. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the exposed C-C bond, leading to the formation of an alkene. Finally, desorption is the release of the product alkene from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate around whether the dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH hinges on the specific catalyst used and the reaction conditions. Catalysts with strong surface binding energies tend to favor the dissociative adsorption step, while catalysts with weaker binding energies allow for faster β-H extraction. The choice of catalyst and operating conditions can significantly influence the rate-controlling step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complex interplay between the catalytic surface, the reactants, and the products. It underscores the importance of carefully selecting catalysts and optimizing operating conditions to maximize the efficiency and selectivity of PDH reactions. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and identify the most effective catalysts for PDH under various conditions.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules break apart upon contacting the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane fragment, leading to the formation of propylene. Desorption is the final step, where the propylene molecule is released from the surface.

Regarding the debate on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, the literature does not definitively resolve this issue. However, it is noted that the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced during the propane ODH reaction, suggesting that the involvement of water might influence the reaction kinetics. The dependency of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations being identical across different surfaces indicates that both surfaces have similar active centers, which might influence the overall reaction rates. 

The uncertainty around which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the most influential factors that determine the efficiency of the reaction. This ambiguity requires further investigation to clarify the relative contributions of each step and to optimize the catalyst design for enhanced propylene production.

The ongoing debate on the rate-controlling step in the PDH process highlights the importance of understanding the detailed mechanisms of the reaction. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient catalysts with improved selectivity and activity, ultimately leading to better processes for converting propane to propylene.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制中的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指丙烷分子在接触催化剂表面时分解的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从吸附的丙烷片段中抽象出一个氢原子，形成丙烯。脱附是最后一步，丙烯分子从表面释放。

关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是决定性步骤的争论，文献没有明确解决这一问题。然而，指出在丙烷ODH反应过程中水的消除能量壁垒可以降低，表明水的参与可能会影响反应动力学。不同表面上反应速率对C3H8、O2和H2O浓度的依赖性相同，表明两个表面具有相似的活性中心，这可能影响整体反应速率。

解离吸附过程或β-H提取是决定性步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定反应效率的关键因素变得更加复杂。这种模糊性需要进一步研究来澄清每个步骤的相对贡献，并指导催化剂设计以提高丙烯产量。

PDH过程的持续争论突出了理解反应详细机制的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，具有改进的选择性和活性，最终导致更好的丙烷转化为丙烯过程。

In the initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides, the most feasible reaction pathway is H abstraction by the terminal MoO site. The CH activation for methylene is 0.20 eV more favorable than that for the methyl CH bond.
On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O. Since it is also possible to generate gaseous H2O at high temperatures, the reaction would follow an ODH mechanism comprising H2O at the initial stage and follow a PDH mechanism forming H2 at the steady stage.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced. The rate of propane ODH reaction is proportional to C3H8 partial pressure and independent of O2 partial pressure in the limit of very low H2O concentrations.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty in this debate is crucial because it affects the identification of the most efficient catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism over Pt(111) is generally accepted, but recent studies propose a non-reverse mechanism over Pt(211). This discrepancy highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to clarify the rate-determining step. The use of dopants and supports can improve selectivity and stability, but the precise role of each factor in the overall catalytic activity remains an area of ongoing investigation.

The most likely active sites over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts were determined through a combination of in situ characterization and DFT calculations. This method provides insights into the specific sites responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane and helps guide the development of more efficient catalysts.

The first step of the propane dehydrogenation process, the activation of the first CH bond, is often identified as the rate-determining step. This conclusion is supported by experimental observations and theoretical calculations.

Modifying Pt-based catalysts with one or more main-group metals or transition metals can enhance their activity. These modifications broaden the d-band of Pt, shifting the d-band center down, which leads to an increase in dehydrogenation activity.

The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger surface area of these clusters. Faster coke formation leads to quicker deactivation, necessitating strategies to control catalyst size and optimize the balance between activity and stability.

The d-band center of Pt(111) is at 1.97 eV relative to the Fermi level, while that of Pt3Ti(111) is downshifted to 2.37 eV due to the strong PtTi dd orbital coupling. This difference affects the adsorption properties of the catalyst surfaces, leading to variations in the relative free energy and barriers of the reaction steps during dehydrogenation and side reactions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这一争议的不确定性对于识别最有效的催化剂和优化反应条件至关重要。在Pt(111)上，通常接受逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制，但最近的研究提出了一种非逆机制在Pt(211)上的主导性。这种差异突出了PDH过程的复杂性和进一步研究澄清速率决定步骤的必要性。使用掺杂剂和支持物可以提高选择性和稳定性，但每种因素在整体催化活性中的精确作用仍然是一个持续研究的领域。

在CeO2支持的NiFe催化剂上确定最有可能的活性位点需要结合原位表征和DFT计算。这种方法提供了有关特定位点负责丙烷脱氢的见解，并有助于指导更高效催化剂的发展。

丙烷脱氢过程的第一步，即第一个CH键的激活，往往被识别为速率决定步骤。这一结论得到了实验观察和理论计算的支持。

通过将一种或多种主族金属或过渡金属添加到Pt基催化剂中，可以增强其活性。这些修改扩展了Pt的d带，降低了d带中心，导致增加脱氢活性。

小Pt簇较高的结焦率是由于这些簇较大的表面积。更快的焦炭形成导致更快的失活，需要策略来控制催化剂尺寸并优化活性与稳定性的平衡。

Pt(111)的d带中心位于费米能级的1.97 eV处，而Pt3Ti(111)的d带中心下移至2.37 eV，这是由于强PtTi dd轨道耦合的结果。这种差异影响了催化剂表面的吸附性质，导致反应步骤期间自由能和壁垒的差异。

The uncertainty about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This debate arises because both steps contribute significantly to the overall reaction rate, making it challenging to determine which step is truly rate-limiting. This uncertainty influences the design of catalysts and reaction conditions for PDH, as optimizing either step can lead to improvements in the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule is split into fragments upon contact with the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from one of these fragments, typically from a methyl or methylene group. Desorption then allows the resulting products, usually propylene, to leave the surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step, the uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction rates and product yields. Different catalysts or reaction conditions might favor one step over the other, influencing the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction. This uncertainty necessitates further research to clarify the relative importance of these steps and optimize the PDH process accordingly.

The oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface modifies the electronic structure of active species and potentially alters the reaction mechanism. This effect is crucial for understanding how oxygen vacancies influence the PDH process. The presence of oxygen vacancies can enhance or inhibit certain reaction pathways, depending on their local structure and coordination.

The kinetic model for propane conversion includes multiple pathways, such as propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion. This model helps explain the complex interplay between different reaction mechanisms and their contributions to the overall yield of propylene. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for optimizing the PDH process and improving propylene production.

The activation energies for the formation of CO and CO2 from secondary propylene combustion are lower than those for propylene formation on TiO2/SiO2-supported VOx catalysts. This inverse relationship indicates that secondary reactions might dominate under certain conditions, affecting the conversion versus selectivity trade-off. This insight is critical for designing catalysts that balance efficiency and selectivity effectively.

The reaction rates on V2O5 powders and supported VOx are independent of the concentrations of propane, oxygen, and water, suggesting that both surfaces have similar active centers. This finding implies that the catalyst's activity is consistent across different conditions, facilitating the optimization of the PDH process.

The valence state of the catalyst plays a role in determining the PDH ability. The oxygen vacancy affects the electronic structure of active species, potentially altering the reaction mechanism and influencing the PDH process. Understanding the specific roles of oxygen vacancies in the PDH process is essential for improving catalyst design and performance.

The lattice oxygen facilitates propylene formation, providing pathways for desired product formation. Meanwhile, surface oxygen primarily leads to the formation of undesired COx species. Balancing these factors is crucial for achieving high propylene yields and selectivity in the PDH process.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时被分裂成片段的过程。β-H提取随后是从这些片段中抽取一个氢原子，通常是从甲基或亚甲基组中抽取。脱附允许产物，通常是丙烯，离开表面。

关于解离吸附或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论，这种不确定性影响了对PDH过程的理解，因为它使预测反应速率和产物产率变得更加复杂。在不同的催化剂或反应条件下，这些步骤可能受到不同的重视，这会影响PDH反应的整体效率和选择性。

氧空位在催化剂表面的出现修改了活性物种的电子结构，并有可能改变反应机制。这种效应对于理解氧空位如何影响PDH过程至关重要。氧空位的存在可以增强或抑制某些反应途径，具体取决于它们的局部结构和配位。

包含多个路径的亲核动力学模型，如丙烷ODH、并行丙烷燃烧和顺序丙烯燃烧，有助于解释不同反应机制之间的复杂相互作用及其对丙烯总产量的贡献。理解这些机制对于优化PDH过程和提高丙烯生产至关重要。

从二次丙烯燃烧形成的CO和CO2的活化能低于TiO2/SiO2支持的VOx催化剂上丙烯形成时的活化能。这种相反的关系表明，在某些条件下，次级反应可能会占主导地位，影响转化与选择性的权衡关系。这一见解对于设计平衡效率和选择性的催化剂非常重要。

V2O5粉末和支持的VOx的反应速率不受丙烷、氧气和水浓度的影响，这表明两者具有相似的活性中心。这一发现意味着催化剂的活性在不同条件下保持一致，有利于优化PDH过程。

催化剂的价态决定了PDH能力。氧空位影响了活性物种的电子结构，可能改变了反应机制，并影响了PDH过程。深入了解氧空位在PDH过程中的特定作用对于改进催化剂设计和性能至关重要。

在催化剂表面上的晶格氧促进了丙烯生成，提供了形成所需产品的途径。同时，表面氧主要导致形成不希望的COx物种。平衡这些因素对于实现高丙烯产率和选择性至关重要。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule is broken into its constituent parts upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the β-position of the propane molecule. Desorption is the final step where the resulting propene molecule is released from the surface. The ongoing debate in the literature focuses on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction step is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of catalysts. The choice of catalyst and operating conditions can influence which step is rate-determining, thereby affecting the overall efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.

The energy required for the first CH bond activation in propane is lower compared to ethane and methane, due to the lower energy of the CH bonds in propane. The energy barriers for the first and second CH bond activations on Pt(111) surfaces are similar, suggesting that the reaction conditions can influence which activation step is rate-limiting. The addition of main-group metals or transition metals can modify the catalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts, potentially shifting the energy barriers for different steps in the reaction pathway. This modification can help in tailoring the catalyst to optimize the selectivity and activity for PDH, addressing the critical challenges of maintaining stability and minimizing byproduct formation.

PDH遵循逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制，包含三个步骤：脱吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。脱吸附吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附时断裂成其组成部分的过程。β-H提取是从丙烷分子的β位移除一个氢原子。最后一步是释放从表面产生的丙烯分子。对于PDH中的控制步骤争论集中在脱吸附吸附过程或β-H提取步骤上。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使预测反应动力学和优化催化剂变得更加复杂。催化剂和操作条件的选择可以影响哪一步成为决定性步骤，从而影响反应的整体效率和选择性。

在111 Pt表面上，第一个CH键活化所需的能量低于乙烷和甲烷，这是由于丙烷中CH键的能量较低。111 Pt表面上的第一和第二CH键活化能相似，表明反应条件可以影响哪一步是决定性的。添加主族金属或过渡金属可以修改基于铂的催化剂的活性，可能改变反应途径中不同步骤的能量壁垒。这可以帮助调整催化剂以优化PDH的活性和选择性，同时解决保持稳定性和减少副产品形成的关键挑战。

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption is the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface by breaking one or more hydrogen bonds. β-H extraction follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane molecule, leading to the formation of propylene and hydrogen. Desorption is the final step where the propylene product is released from the surface. The ongoing debate revolves around whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. If dissociative adsorption is the rate-controlling step, the focus should be on optimizing the adsorption process. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, efforts should be directed towards enhancing the extraction mechanism. The correct identification of the rate-controlling step is crucial for the development of more efficient PDH catalysts.
