[1] "The advantage of this approach is that overoxidation of the reactants and products can be reduced and therefore the olefin selectivity can be enhanced."
[2] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."
[3] "The strongly endothermic nature of PDH (ΔrH = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800-980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."
[4] "The energy barriers for the first and second CH bond activations are quite close on Pt(111). The RDS could change with the reaction conditions."
[5] "The lower CH bond energy leads to a lower activation energy of propane activation than ethane and methane activation."
[6] "The addition of one or more main-group metals or TMs is an effective way to modify Pt-based catalysts."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule is broken into its constituent parts upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the β-position of the propane molecule. Desorption is the final step where the resulting propene molecule is released from the surface. The ongoing debate in the literature focuses on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction step is the rate-controlling step in PDH. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of catalysts. The choice of catalyst and operating conditions can influence which step is rate-determining, thereby affecting the overall efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.

The energy required for the first CH bond activation in propane is lower compared to ethane and methane, due to the lower energy of the CH bonds in propane. The energy barriers for the first and second CH bond activations on Pt(111) surfaces are similar, suggesting that the reaction conditions can influence which activation step is rate-limiting. The addition of main-group metals or transition metals can modify the catalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts, potentially shifting the energy barriers for different steps in the reaction pathway. This modification can help in tailoring the catalyst to optimize the selectivity and activity for PDH, addressing the critical challenges of maintaining stability and minimizing byproduct formation.

PDH遵循逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制，包含三个步骤：脱吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。脱吸附吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附时断裂成其组成部分的过程。β-H提取是从丙烷分子的β位移除一个氢原子。最后一步是释放从表面产生的丙烯分子。对于PDH中的控制步骤争论集中在脱吸附吸附过程或β-H提取步骤上。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使预测反应动力学和优化催化剂变得更加复杂。催化剂和操作条件的选择可以影响哪一步成为决定性步骤，从而影响反应的整体效率和选择性。

在111 Pt表面上，第一个CH键活化所需的能量低于乙烷和甲烷，这是由于丙烷中CH键的能量较低。111 Pt表面上的第一和第二CH键活化能相似，表明反应条件可以影响哪一步是决定性的。添加主族金属或过渡金属可以修改基于铂的催化剂的活性，可能改变反应途径中不同步骤的能量壁垒。这可以帮助调整催化剂以优化PDH的活性和选择性，同时解决保持稳定性和减少副产品形成的关键挑战。
