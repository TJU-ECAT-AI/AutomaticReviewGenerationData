The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption involves the separation of propane molecules from the surface of a catalyst, exposing the carbon-carbon (C-C) bond for reaction. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the exposed C-C bond, leading to the formation of an alkene. Finally, desorption is the release of the product alkene from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate around whether the dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH hinges on the specific catalyst used and the reaction conditions. Catalysts with strong surface binding energies tend to favor the dissociative adsorption step, while catalysts with weaker binding energies allow for faster β-H extraction. The choice of catalyst and operating conditions can significantly influence the rate-controlling step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complex interplay between the catalytic surface, the reactants, and the products. It underscores the importance of carefully selecting catalysts and optimizing operating conditions to maximize the efficiency and selectivity of PDH reactions. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and identify the most effective catalysts for PDH under various conditions.
