The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The literature does not directly address this debate, but it does emphasize the importance of elucidating active sites, mechanisms, microkinetic modeling, and electronic features to optimize the PDH process. This includes strategies to suppress side reactions and coke formation. The lack of clear consensus on the rate-controlling step in PDH suggests that further research is needed to fully understand and optimize this process.
