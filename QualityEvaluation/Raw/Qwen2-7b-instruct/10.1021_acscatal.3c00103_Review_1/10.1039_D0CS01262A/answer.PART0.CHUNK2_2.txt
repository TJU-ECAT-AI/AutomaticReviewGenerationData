The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate regarding which step is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The uncertainty in this debate is crucial because it affects the identification of the most efficient catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism over Pt(111) is generally accepted, but recent studies propose a non-reverse mechanism over Pt(211). This discrepancy highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to clarify the rate-determining step. The use of dopants and supports can improve selectivity and stability, but the precise role of each factor in the overall catalytic activity remains an area of ongoing investigation.

The most likely active sites over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts were determined through a combination of in situ characterization and DFT calculations. This method provides insights into the specific sites responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane and helps guide the development of more efficient catalysts.

The first step of the propane dehydrogenation process, the activation of the first CH bond, is often identified as the rate-determining step. This conclusion is supported by experimental observations and theoretical calculations.

Modifying Pt-based catalysts with one or more main-group metals or transition metals can enhance their activity. These modifications broaden the d-band of Pt, shifting the d-band center down, which leads to an increase in dehydrogenation activity.

The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger surface area of these clusters. Faster coke formation leads to quicker deactivation, necessitating strategies to control catalyst size and optimize the balance between activity and stability.

The d-band center of Pt(111) is at 1.97 eV relative to the Fermi level, while that of Pt3Ti(111) is downshifted to 2.37 eV due to the strong PtTi dd orbital coupling. This difference affects the adsorption properties of the catalyst surfaces, leading to variations in the relative free energy and barriers of the reaction steps during dehydrogenation and side reactions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于哪一步是速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这一争议的不确定性对于识别最有效的催化剂和优化反应条件至关重要。在Pt(111)上，通常接受逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制，但最近的研究提出了一种非逆机制在Pt(211)上的主导性。这种差异突出了PDH过程的复杂性和进一步研究澄清速率决定步骤的必要性。使用掺杂剂和支持物可以提高选择性和稳定性，但每种因素在整体催化活性中的精确作用仍然是一个持续研究的领域。

在CeO2支持的NiFe催化剂上确定最有可能的活性位点需要结合原位表征和DFT计算。这种方法提供了有关特定位点负责丙烷脱氢的见解，并有助于指导更高效催化剂的发展。

丙烷脱氢过程的第一步，即第一个CH键的激活，往往被识别为速率决定步骤。这一结论得到了实验观察和理论计算的支持。

通过将一种或多种主族金属或过渡金属添加到Pt基催化剂中，可以增强其活性。这些修改扩展了Pt的d带，降低了d带中心，导致增加脱氢活性。

小Pt簇较高的结焦率是由于这些簇较大的表面积。更快的焦炭形成导致更快的失活，需要策略来控制催化剂尺寸并优化活性与稳定性的平衡。

Pt(111)的d带中心位于费米能级的1.97 eV处，而Pt3Ti(111)的d带中心下移至2.37 eV，这是由于强PtTi dd轨道耦合的结果。这种差异影响了催化剂表面的吸附性质，导致反应步骤期间自由能和壁垒的差异。
