The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts consists of three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty affects our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the optimization of catalyst efficiency.
