The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation consists of three main stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is a significant debate within the scientific community about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This uncertainty affects our comprehension of the PDH process, particularly concerning the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic reactions involved.
