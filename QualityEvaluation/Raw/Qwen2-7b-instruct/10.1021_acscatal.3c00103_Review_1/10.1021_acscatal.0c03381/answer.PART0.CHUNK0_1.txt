[1] "Beyond the Reverse HoriutiPolanyi Mechanism in Propane Dehydrogenation over Pt Catalysts"
[2] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three main steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[3] "The rate-controlling step in this reaction is subject to ongoing debate among researchers."
[4] "Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption process might be the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the β-H extraction is more critical."
[5] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process and hinders the development of efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts comprises three primary stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate among researchers revolves around which of these steps—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. This ambiguity complicates our understanding of the propane dehydrogenation process and poses challenges in optimizing catalysts for this reaction.
