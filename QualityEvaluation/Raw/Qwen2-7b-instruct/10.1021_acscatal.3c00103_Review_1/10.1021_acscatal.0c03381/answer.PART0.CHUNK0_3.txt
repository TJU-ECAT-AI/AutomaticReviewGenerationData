[1] "Beyond the Reverse HoriutiPolanyi Mechanism in Propane Dehydrogenation over Pt Catalysts"
[2] "The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism plays a significant role in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process."
[3] "This mechanism consists of three main steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[4] "The dissociative adsorption step involves the breaking of the propane molecule into two fragments on the catalyst surface."
[5] "The β-H extraction step follows, where a hydrogen atom is removed from one of the fragments."
[6] "Finally, the desorption step releases the resulting olefin from the catalyst surface."
[7] "There is an ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in the PDH process."
[8] "Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption step is the rate-determining step."
[9] "Others propose that the β-H extraction process controls the reaction rate."
[10] "This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process."

The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption involves the splitting of propane molecules into fragments on the catalyst surface. Following this, a hydrogen atom is extracted during the β-H extraction step. Lastly, the desorption step releases the resulting olefin from the catalyst surface. There is a debate about which step is the rate-controlling factor in the PDH process, with some suggesting the dissociative adsorption and others proposing the β-H extraction. This uncertainty affects our understanding of the PDH process.

逆霍尔维茨-波兰尼机制在丙烷裂解（PDH）过程中包含三个步骤：离散吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离散吸附涉及在催化剂表面将丙烷分子分解成碎片。接下来，在β-H提取步骤中，从一个碎片中提取一个氢原子。最后，脱附步骤释放出催化剂表面上的结果烯烃。关于PDH过程中的速率控制步骤存在争议，一些人认为是离散吸附步骤，而另一些人则认为是β-H提取。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。
