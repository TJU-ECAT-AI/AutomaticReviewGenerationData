The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption involves the splitting of propane molecules into fragments on the catalyst surface. Following this, a hydrogen atom is extracted during the β-H extraction step. Lastly, the desorption step releases the resulting olefin from the catalyst surface. There is a debate about which step is the rate-controlling factor in the PDH process, with some suggesting the dissociative adsorption and others proposing the β-H extraction. This uncertainty affects our understanding of the PDH process.
