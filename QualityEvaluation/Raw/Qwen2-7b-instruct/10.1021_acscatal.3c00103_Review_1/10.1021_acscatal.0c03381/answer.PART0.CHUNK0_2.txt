[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption step, where propane molecules are broken down into hydrogen and carbon species, has been debated as potentially being the rate-controlling step."
[3] "Some researchers argue that the β-H extraction process, which involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from the catalyst surface, might actually be the rate-limiting step."
[4] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences how we optimize catalysts and control reaction rates."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is a debate over whether the dissociative adsorption step or the β-H extraction process is the rate-determining factor. This ambiguity affects our comprehension of the PDH process, influencing catalyst optimization and reaction rate control.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的三个阶段：解离吸附，β-H提取和脱附。争论在于解离吸附步骤还是β-H提取过程是决定性步骤。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，影响催化剂优化和反应速率控制。
