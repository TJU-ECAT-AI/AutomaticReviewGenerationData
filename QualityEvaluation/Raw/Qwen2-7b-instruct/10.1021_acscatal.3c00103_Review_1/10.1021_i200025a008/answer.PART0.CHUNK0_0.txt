[1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
[2] "The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction has persisted."
[3] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation consists of three stages: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing discussion about which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-determining step in the reaction. This ambiguity affects our comprehension of the propane dehydrogenation process.
