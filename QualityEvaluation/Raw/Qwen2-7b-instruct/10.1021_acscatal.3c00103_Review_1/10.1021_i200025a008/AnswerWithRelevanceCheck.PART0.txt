          [1] "The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption."
          [2] "The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction has persisted."
          [3] "This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) includes three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing discussion about which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-determining step in the reaction. This ambiguity affects our understanding of the PDH process.
