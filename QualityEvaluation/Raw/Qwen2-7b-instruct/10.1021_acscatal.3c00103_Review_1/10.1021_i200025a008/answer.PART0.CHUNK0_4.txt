The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) comprises three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There remains an ongoing debate within the scientific community about which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-determining step in the PDH process. This uncertainty has significant implications for our comprehension and management of the PDH mechanism.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。科学界对于这三种步骤中，哪一步（离解吸附或β-H提取）作为PDH过程的速率决定步骤存在持续的争议。这种不确定性对理解PDH机制及其管理具有重要意义。
