The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. There is an ongoing discussion about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-limiting step in this reaction. This ambiguity affects our comprehension of the PDH process.
