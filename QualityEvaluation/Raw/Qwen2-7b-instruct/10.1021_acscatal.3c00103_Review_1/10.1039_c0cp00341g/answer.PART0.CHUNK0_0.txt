[1] "The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on the flat and stepped surfaces, respectively."
[2] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[3] "As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleaving of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of methane, ethane and coke."

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH, the dissociative adsorption process involves the separation of propane molecules into fragments upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane fragment, typically from the CH or CC bond. The final step is the desorption of the resulting product from the surface. The debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction kinetics and mechanism. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step can lead to discrepancies in predicting the efficiency of the reaction and optimizing the conditions for maximum yield of propylene. This uncertainty is critical for developing more effective catalysts and improving the selectivity and activity of PDH processes.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制，涉及三个连续步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在PDH的背景下，解吸附吸附过程涉及将丙烷分子分解成片段并吸附到催化剂表面。随后的β-H提取步骤涉及从吸附的丙烷片段中提取一个氢原子，通常是从CH或CC键。最后一步是将产物从表面脱附。关于PDH中解吸附吸附步骤与β-H提取步骤哪个是决定速率的关键步骤的争论，影响着我们对反应动力学和机制的理解。这种不确定性可能导致预测反应效率和优化条件以实现丙烯最大产率时出现分歧。这种不确定性对于开发更有效的催化剂和提高PDH过程的选择性和活性至关重要。
