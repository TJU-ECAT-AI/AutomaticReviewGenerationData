[1] "The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on the flat and stepped surfaces, respectively."
[2] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[3] "As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleaving of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of methane, ethane and coke."
[4] "According to previous experimental work and our DFT calculations, the propane dehydrogenation process can be divided into two stages, namely the quick deactivation stage and steady state. At the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface is suggested to be the active center for all the reactions including the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives."
[5] "At the steady state, while the catalytic activity towards propylene dehydrogenation is lowered, high selectivity towards propylene is attained because propylene desorption is promoted and simultaneously the deep dehydrogenation of propylene is suppressed on the flat surface."

1. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are higher on the flat surface compared to the stepped surface. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate is about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.

2. The selectivity towards propylene is lowered on the stepped surface due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms. This means that the stepped surface is more active in dehydrogenation but less selective for propylene production.

3. Propyne is identified as the starting point for the cleavage of the CC bond during the deep dehydrogenation process, leading to the formation of methane, ethane, and coke.

4. The propane dehydrogenation process is divided into two stages: quick deactivation and steady state. During the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface is the active center for all reactions, including dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.

5. At the steady state, the catalytic activity for propylene dehydrogenation decreases, but the selectivity towards propylene increases. This happens because propylene desorption is promoted, and the deep dehydrogenation of propylene is suppressed on the flat surface.

1. 烷基化反应中，丙烷转化为丙烯的能量壁垒在平坦表面上比在阶梯表面上高。逆霍里图-波兰尼机制包括三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于是离解吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论，影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。

2. 在阶梯表面上，由于存在配位不饱和表面Pt原子，丙烯的选择性降低。这意味着阶梯表面在脱氢化过程中更为活跃，但丙烯的生产选择性较低。

3. 丙炔被识别为在深度脱氢过程中CC键断裂的起始点，导致甲烷、乙烷和焦炭的形成。

4. 烷基化过程分为两个阶段：快速失活和稳态。在快速失活阶段，阶梯表面是所有反应（包括C3衍生物的脱氢和裂解）的活性中心。

5. 在稳态时，丙烯脱氢的催化活性下降，但丙烯的选择性增加。这是因为丙烯脱附得到促进，同时在平坦表面上丙烯的深度脱氢受到抑制。
