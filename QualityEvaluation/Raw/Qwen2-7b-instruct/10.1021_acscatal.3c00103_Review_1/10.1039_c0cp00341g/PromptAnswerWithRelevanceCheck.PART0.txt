[1] "The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on the flat and stepped surfaces, respectively."
[2] "Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms."
[3] "As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleaving of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of methane, ethane and coke."

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of PDH, the dissociative adsorption process involves the separation of propane molecules into fragments upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. The β-H extraction step follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed propane fragment, typically from the CH or CC bond. The final step is the desorption of the resulting product from the surface. The debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction kinetics and mechanism. The uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step can lead to discrepancies in predicting the efficiency of the reaction and optimizing the conditions for maximum yield of propylene. This uncertainty is critical for developing more effective catalysts and improving the selectivity and activity of PDH processes.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制，涉及三个连续步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在PDH的背景下，解吸附吸附过程涉及将丙烷分子分解成片段并吸附到催化剂表面。随后的β-H提取步骤涉及从吸附的丙烷片段中提取一个氢原子，通常是从CH或CC键。最后一步是将产物从表面脱附。关于PDH中解吸附吸附步骤与β-H提取步骤哪个是决定速率的关键步骤的争论，影响着我们对反应动力学和机制的理解。这种不确定性可能导致预测反应效率和优化条件以实现丙烯最大产率时出现分歧。这种不确定性对于开发更有效的催化剂和提高PDH过程的选择性和活性至关重要。

1. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are higher on the flat surface compared to the stepped surface. The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate is about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.

2. The selectivity towards propylene is lowered on the stepped surface due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms. This means that the stepped surface is more active in dehydrogenation but less selective for propylene production.

3. Propyne is identified as the starting point for the cleavage of the CC bond during the deep dehydrogenation process, leading to the formation of methane, ethane, and coke.

4. The propane dehydrogenation process is divided into two stages: quick deactivation and steady state. During the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface is the active center for all reactions, including dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.

5. At the steady state, the catalytic activity for propylene dehydrogenation decreases, but the selectivity towards propylene increases. This happens because propylene desorption is promoted, and the deep dehydrogenation of propylene is suppressed on the flat surface.

1. 烷基化反应中，丙烷转化为丙烯的能量壁垒在平坦表面上比在阶梯表面上高。逆霍里图-波兰尼机制包括三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于是离解吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论，影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响反应的效率和选择性。

2. 在阶梯表面上，由于存在配位不饱和表面Pt原子，丙烯的选择性降低。这意味着阶梯表面在脱氢化过程中更为活跃，但丙烯的生产选择性较低。

3. 丙炔被识别为在深度脱氢过程中CC键断裂的起始点，导致甲烷、乙烷和焦炭的形成。

4. 烷基化过程分为两个阶段：快速失活和稳态。在快速失活阶段，阶梯表面是所有反应（包括C3衍生物的脱氢和裂解）的活性中心。

5. 在稳态时，丙烯脱氢的催化活性下降，但丙烯的选择性增加。这是因为丙烯脱附得到促进，同时在平坦表面上丙烯的深度脱氢受到抑制。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule splits into its constituent atoms or radicals upon contacting the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is removed from one of the resulting fragments. Finally, desorption is the release of the product from the surface back into the gas phase. The ongoing debate in the scientific community centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of catalyst design for more efficient propane dehydrogenation.

Critically discussing the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH, the literature does not explicitly resolve this debate. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation steps on the flat surface and stepped surface indicate that the stepped surface offers a more favorable pathway for propane dehydrogenation. However, this does not directly address which step is rate-limiting.

Answer: The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a proposed pathway that involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step involves the separation of propane molecules into individual atoms or radicals upon contact with the catalyst surface. This is followed by the β-H extraction step, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed species, typically forming an alkyl radical. Finally, the desorption step occurs, where the resulting product is released from the surface.

Regarding the ongoing debate on which step is the rate-controlling step, the literature suggests that the choice between dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction as the rate-controlling step depends on various factors, including the nature of the catalyst, the specific conditions of the reaction, and the relative energy barriers associated with each step. The energy barriers calculated in the document indicate that the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene is more favorable on stepped surfaces, suggesting that the stepped sites might facilitate these processes more efficiently.

The uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of catalytic conditions. It highlights the importance of considering multiple factors, such as surface structure, hydrogen availability, and reaction intermediates, when designing and evaluating catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）的一个提议途径，包括三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H抽取和脱附。解吸附吸附步骤涉及在催化剂表面接触时，丙烷分子分解成单个原子或自由基。随后是β-H抽取步骤，在此步骤中，从吸附物种中抽象出一个氢原子，通常形成烷基自由基。最后是脱附步骤，此时产物从表面释放。

关于解吸附吸附或β-H抽取作为控制步骤的争论，文献表明，选择哪个步骤取决于多种因素，包括催化剂的性质、反应的具体条件以及与每个步骤相关的能量壁垒。计算的能量壁垒表明，丙烷脱氢生成丙烯在步面表面上更为有利，这暗示步面点可能更有效地促进这些过程。

对于PDH过程的理解受到不确定性的影响，因为它复杂了反应动力学的预测和催化剂条件的优化。它强调了在设计和评估丙烷脱氢催化剂时考虑多个因素的重要性，如表面结构、氢的可用性和反应中间体。
