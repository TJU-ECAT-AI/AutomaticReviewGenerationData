DFT study of propane dehydrogenation on Pt catalyst: effects of step sites Self-consistent periodic slab calculations based on gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT-GGA) have been conducted to examine the reaction network of propane dehydrogenation over close-packed Pt(111) and stepped Pt(211) surfaces.
The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on flat and stepped surfaces, respectively.
Taking the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms.
Propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives rise to the formation of ethane, methane and coke.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule splits into its constituent atoms or radicals upon contacting the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is removed from one of the resulting fragments. Finally, desorption is the release of the product from the surface back into the gas phase. The ongoing debate in the scientific community centers around which of these steps, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, acts as the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the prediction of reaction kinetics and the optimization of catalyst design for more efficient propane dehydrogenation.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里图-波兰尼机制涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附是指在催化剂表面接触时，丙烷分子分裂成其组成部分原子或自由基的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从形成的结果片段之一去除一个氢原子。最后，脱附是从表面释放产物回到气相的过程。科学界围绕这些步骤中的哪一个，即离解吸附或β-H提取，作为PDH过程的速率控制步骤，存在持续的争论。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使预测反应动力学和优化催化剂设计以实现更高效的丙烷脱氢变得复杂。
