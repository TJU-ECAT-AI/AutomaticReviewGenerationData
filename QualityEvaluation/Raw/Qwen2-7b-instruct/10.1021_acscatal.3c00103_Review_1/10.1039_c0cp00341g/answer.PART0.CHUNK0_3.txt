"DFT study of propane dehydrogenation on Pt catalyst: effects of step sites Self-consistent periodic slab calculations based on gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT-GGA) have been conducted to examine the reaction network of propane dehydrogenation over close-packed Pt(111) and stepped Pt(211) surfaces. Selective CH or CC bond cleaving is investigated to gain a better understanding of the catalyst site requirements for propane dehydrogenation. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on flat and stepped surfaces, respectively."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV on the flat surface and 0.250.35 eV on the stepped surface, indicating the stepped surface is more favorable for this reaction.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在平面上，丙烷脱氢形成丙烯的能量壁垒范围为0.650.75 eV，在斜面上为0.250.35 eV，这表明斜面对于此反应更为有利。

Critically discussing the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH, the literature does not explicitly resolve this debate. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation steps on the flat surface and stepped surface indicate that the stepped surface offers a more favorable pathway for propane dehydrogenation. However, this does not directly address which step is rate-limiting.

对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中是解吸附吸附过程还是β-H提取是决定性步骤的争论，文献没有明确解决这一争议。平面上和斜面上脱氢步骤的能量壁垒表明斜面提供了更有利于丙烷脱氢的途径。然而，这并未直接说明哪个步骤是决定性的。
