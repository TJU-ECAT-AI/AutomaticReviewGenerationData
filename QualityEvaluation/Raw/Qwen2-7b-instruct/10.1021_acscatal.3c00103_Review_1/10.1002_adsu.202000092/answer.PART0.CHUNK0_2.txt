The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules break down upon contact with the catalyst surface, forming smaller, more reactive intermediates. The β-H extraction step involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from these intermediates, leading to the formation of propylene. Desorption is the final step, where the newly formed propylene molecules are released from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH primarily hinges on the kinetics and energetics of these processes. If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, it suggests that the efficiency of the process depends on how quickly propane molecules can be broken down into reactive intermediates. Conversely, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, it implies that the speed of hydrogen atom removal significantly influences the overall PDH rate.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it affects the optimization of industrial conditions. For instance, if dissociative adsorption is found to be the rate-limiting step, efforts might focus on enhancing the surface area or reactivity of the catalyst to improve the adsorption rate. On the other hand, if β-H extraction is rate-controlling, strategies might concentrate on increasing the rate of hydrogen atom removal to maximize propylene production.

The finding that the coke formed during PDH can be hydrogenated to propylene provides theoretical guidance for optimizing process parameters in industry. This insight suggests that managing the coke formation process could potentially enhance propylene yield and reduce the need for energy-intensive regeneration procedures, thereby decreasing CO2 emissions.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解吸附吸附是指丙烷分子在催化剂表面接触时分解，形成更易反应的中间体的过程。β-H提取步骤涉及从这些中间体中移除一个氢原子，导致丙烯的形成。脱附是最后一步，在此步骤中，新形成的丙烯分子从催化剂表面上释放出来。

关于在PDH过程中是解吸附吸附还是β-H提取是控制速率步骤的持续争议主要依赖于这些过程的动力学和能量。如果解吸附吸附是控制步骤，它表明过程的效率取决于丙烷分子如何快速分解成活性中间体。相反，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，这表明氢原子去除的速度显著影响总体PDH速率。

这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响工业条件的优化。例如，如果发现解吸附吸附是控制步骤，努力可能集中在增加催化剂的表面积或活性以提高吸附速率。另一方面，如果β-H提取是控制步骤，策略可能集中在加快氢原子去除速率以最大化丙烯产量。

发现PDH过程中形成的焦炭可以氢化为丙烯提供了工业参数优化的理论指导。这一见解表明，管理焦炭形成过程可能有助于提高丙烯产量并减少需要进行耗能严重的再生程序，从而降低二氧化碳排放量。
