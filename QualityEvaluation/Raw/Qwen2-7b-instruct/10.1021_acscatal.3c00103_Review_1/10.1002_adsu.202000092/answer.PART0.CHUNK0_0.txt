[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyzed by PtSn/Al2O3 is a vital industrial process for producing propylene."
[2] "However, coke produced in the process deactivates the catalyst and the energy-intensive regeneration procedures can produce considerable CO2 emission."
[3] "In this work, coke on the spent catalysts is analyzed by thermogravimetric-mass spectra, Raman spectra, 1H solid NMR spectra, and infrared spectra."
[4] "Several C3 species, including propyl, propylidene and propylidyne are found on the surface of the PtSn alloy."
[5] "It is also found that this coke can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process."
[6] "These results could provide theoretical guidance for optimizing process parameters in industry."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism is central to understanding the PDH process, particularly as it pertains to the formation of coke and its potential conversion back to propylene. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty suggests that the specific conditions under which these reactions occur might significantly influence the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process. Therefore, understanding the precise mechanisms involved could provide insights into optimizing the process parameters to enhance yield and reduce environmental impact, such as minimizing CO2 emissions during the regeneration of catalysts.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。这一机制对于理解PDH过程，特别是焦炭形成及其潜在的回转为丙烯，至关重要。关于该反应中是否是离解吸附过程还是β-H提取成为速率控制步骤的持续辩论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性表明，在这些反应发生的特定条件下，PDH过程的效率和选择性可能受到显著影响。因此，理解这些具体机制可以提供优化过程参数的见解，以提高产率并减少环境影响，例如在催化剂再生过程中减少二氧化碳排放。
