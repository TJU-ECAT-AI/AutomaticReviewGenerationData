[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyzed by PtSn/Al2O3 is a vital industrial process for producing propylene."
[2] "Coke produced in the process deactivates the catalyst and the energy-intensive regeneration procedures can produce considerable CO2 emission."
[3] "Several C3 species, including propyl, propylidene and propylidyne are found on the surface of the PtSn alloy."
[4] "Several reaction pathways are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[5] "It is also found that this coke can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. This mechanism has been debated in the scientific community as to whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty surrounding this debate impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it influences how we optimize process parameters in industry. According to recent studies, coke formed during the PDH process can be hydrogenated back to propylene, providing insights for process optimization.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解吸附吸附，β-H提取和脱附。这种机制在科学界一直存在争议，争议焦点在于解吸附吸附过程还是β-H提取是控制反应速率的关键步骤。这一争议的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了我们在工业中优化工艺参数的方式。根据最近的研究，PDH过程中形成的焦炭可以被氢化回丙烯，为过程优化提供了见解。
