The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. This uncertainty is crucial because it affects the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The coke formed during the PDH process, which can be hydrogenated to propylene, suggests that the reaction pathways are complex and involve multiple steps. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to investigate these pathways, providing insights into the structure and formation of coke on the PtSn alloy.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制涉及丙烷脱氢化（PDH）的三个步骤：解吸附吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于解吸附吸附过程或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了PDH过程的理解。这种不确定性至关重要，因为它影响了过程的效率和选择性。在PDH过程中形成的焦炭可以被氢化为丙烯，这表明反应途径复杂且涉及多个步骤。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算已被用来研究这些路径，提供了关于PtSn合金表面焦炭结构和形成的信息。
