The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, there is ongoing debate regarding which of these steps is the rate-controlling one. The uncertainty surrounding this issue impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the key factors controlling the reaction rate. The presence of several C3 species on the surface of the PtSn alloy suggests that these species play a crucial role in the reaction dynamics. Moreover, the fact that the coke can be hydrogenated to propylene indicates that the mechanism might involve complex interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products.

反霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：吸附解离、β-H提取和脱附。然而，关于这一步骤中哪一步是控制速率的关键存在争议。这种不确定性影响了对PDH过程的理解，因为它使确定反应速率关键因素变得复杂。表面PtSn合金上发现的几种C3物种表明，这些物种在反应动力学中起着关键作用。此外，焦炭可以被氢化为丙烯的事实表明，机制可能涉及催化剂、反应物和产物之间的复杂相互作用。
