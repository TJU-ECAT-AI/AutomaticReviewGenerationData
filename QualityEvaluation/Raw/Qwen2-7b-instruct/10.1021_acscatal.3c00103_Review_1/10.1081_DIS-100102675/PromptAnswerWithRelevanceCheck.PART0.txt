Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

Answer: The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty around this point impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the primary mechanism driving the reaction rate.

答案：丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍尔维茨-波兰尼机制包括三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于是离解吸附还是β-H提取作为反应速率控制步骤的持续争论，影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为这使得确定驱动反应速率的主要机制变得更加复杂。
