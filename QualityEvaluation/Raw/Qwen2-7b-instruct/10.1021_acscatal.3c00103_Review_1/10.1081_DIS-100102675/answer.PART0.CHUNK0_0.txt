Answer: The reverse Horwitz-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The ongoing debate focuses on whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction acts as the rate-controlling step in this reaction. The uncertainty around this point impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the primary mechanism driving the reaction rate.
