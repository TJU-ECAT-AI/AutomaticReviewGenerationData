[1] "The introduction of metal species into zeolites is a promising and efficient approach to construct solid catalysts."
[2] "During the catalytic reaction, the valence states of metal species can be transformed from one to another, showing reversible and/or irreversible features."
[3] "In recent years, the dynamic evolution of metal active sites in zeolites have been found in several catalytic reactions (e.g., methane dehydroaromatization (MDA), (85) selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NOx), (86,87) and methane oxidation to methanol). (83,8891)"

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is the rate-controlling step in this reaction, as it determines the rate at which propane molecules are converted to propylene. The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the overall reaction kinetics and the selectivity towards propylene production. This debate influences the development of catalysts and reaction conditions for PDH, aiming to optimize propylene yield and purity.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个步骤：离解吸附，β-H提取和脱附。离解吸附步骤是该反应的速率控制步骤，因为它决定了丙烷分子转化为丙烯的速率。关于离解吸附过程是否是速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了整个反应动力学以及丙烯产量的选择性。这一辩论影响了PDH催化剂和反应条件的发展，旨在优化丙烯的产率和纯度。
