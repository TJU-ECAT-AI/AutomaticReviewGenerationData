The question regarding the reverse Horiti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and the ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step is not addressed in the provided literature. The literature focuses on the dynamic evolution of zeolite frameworks and metal-zeolite interfaces, rather than on the specific PDH reaction mechanism. Therefore, there is no quote or information from the document that directly addresses this question.
