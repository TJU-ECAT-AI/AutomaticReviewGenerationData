<quotes>
[1] "The interactions between the host zeolites/metal-zeolites and guest molecules will be globally and dynamically illustrated at the atomic level."
[2] "The interactions between H2O and zeolite framework are complex because the H2O inside zeolites possesses distinct structures as compared with those in an environment without confinement."
[3] "The reversible breaking and formation of TOT bonds in SAPO-34 helped to realize the introduction of TMP and pyridine into the cavities of SAPO-34, which can be used to characterize the acidity of zeolites with smaller pore windows than probe molecules."
[4] "The type, composition, and topological structure of zeolites can affect the interactions between H2O and zeolites and thereby affect the properties of zeolites."

The reverse Horita-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The controversy lies in identifying which step is the rate-controlling factor. This uncertainty complicates our understanding of the PDH process, particularly in optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions.

The dissociative adsorption step involves the separation of propane molecules into individual atoms or radicals, which is thought to be rate-limiting. The β-H extraction step follows, where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the propane molecule. Finally, the desorption step releases the resulting products from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting impacts the design and performance of PDH catalysts. Understanding the precise sequence and kinetics of these steps is essential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts. The uncertainty in the mechanism suggests that further research is needed to clarify the role of each step and to optimize the PDH process accordingly.

逆Horita-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。争议在于确定哪个步骤是决定性的。这使得我们理解PDH过程变得复杂，特别是在优化催化剂和反应条件时。

解离吸附步骤包括将丙烷分子分离成单个原子或自由基，这被认为可能是速率限制因素。随后是β-H提取步骤，其中从丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子。最后是脱附步骤，将产物从催化剂表面释放出来。

关于哪个步骤是决定性的持续争议影响了PDH催化剂的设计和性能。了解这些步骤的确切顺序和动力学对于开发更高效和选择性更强的催化剂至关重要。不确定性表明需要进一步研究来澄清每个步骤的作用，并相应地优化PDH过程。

[1] "In the past, zeolites and metal-zeolites are usually characterized in static conditions. However, fast bond breaking and formation, evolution of metal valence states, phase transformation, and migration would occur over the zeolites and metal-zeolites during the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the identification of active sites and catalytic mechanisms should globally consider the evolution of zeolites and metal species under reaction conditions."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction's kinetics and mechanism. This uncertainty suggests that either step could significantly influence the reaction rate, necessitating a detailed examination of both processes to accurately describe the mechanism. The choice of the rate-controlling step affects how the reaction is modeled and potentially optimized for industrial applications.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The dissociative adsorption step is the rate-controlling step in this reaction, as it determines the rate at which propane molecules are converted to propylene. The uncertainty regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the overall reaction kinetics and the selectivity towards propylene production. This debate influences the development of catalysts and reaction conditions for PDH, aiming to optimize propylene yield and purity.
