[1] "In the past, zeolites and metal-zeolites are usually characterized in static conditions. However, fast bond breaking and formation, evolution of metal valence states, phase transformation, and migration would occur over the zeolites and metal-zeolites during the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the identification of active sites and catalytic mechanisms should globally consider the evolution of zeolites and metal species under reaction conditions."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three sequential steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate about whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction's kinetics and mechanism. This uncertainty suggests that either step could significantly influence the reaction rate, necessitating a detailed examination of both processes to accurately describe the mechanism. The choice of the rate-controlling step affects how the reaction is modeled and potentially optimized for industrial applications.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及三个连续步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在PDH中，吸附过程或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对反应动力学和机制的理解。这种不确定性表明，这两个步骤中的任何一个都可能显著影响反应速率，需要对两个过程进行详细研究，以准确描述机制。选择速率控制步骤的选择影响了反应的建模方式及其在工业应用中的优化。
