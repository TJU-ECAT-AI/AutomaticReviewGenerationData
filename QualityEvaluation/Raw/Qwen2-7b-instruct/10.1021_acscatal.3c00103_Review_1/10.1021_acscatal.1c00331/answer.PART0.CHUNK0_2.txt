<p>Although the process has been commercialized with high selectivity for decades, the prevention of coke deposition is still a daunting challenge.</p>
<p>The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke.</p>
<p>The coke on metal is easier to remove by oxidization than the counterpart on the support.</p>
<p>However, the coke on the support does not have a noticeable influence on activity and stability.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop an effective strategy to inhibit coke formation, as discussed in section 3.</p>
<p>The coke is formed immediately when the catalyst is exposed to propane, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis of PDH on Pt/Al2O3 shows that the coke forms rapidly in the first few minutes, and then the intensity of the coke species slowly drops to a constant over an hour.</p>
<p>The initial coke formation quickly covers the active sites. Then, the occupation of available sites significantly reduced the rates of coke formation after initial stage.</p>
<p>A more thorough kinetic model was investigated by Li et al. (59) The deep dehydrogenation and crack from propane to the C atom and the polymerization of propylene are both considered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH.</p>
<p>The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>For example, the size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance.</p>
<p>Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH.</p>
<p>The size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance.</p>
<p>The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the phenomena is explained as the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule breaks apart upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed intermediate, typically leading to the formation of a double bond. Desorption then occurs as the resulting product is released from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction mechanism and the factors influencing its efficiency. The uncertainty around this mechanism highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to elucidate the precise roles of these steps. The identification of the rate-controlling step could guide the development of more efficient catalysts and process conditions for PDH.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附时断裂的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从吸附的中间体中提取一个氢原子，通常导致双键的形成。脱附则是产物从表面释放的过程。PDH过程中，解离吸附或β-H提取哪个是决定性步骤的争论影响了我们对反应机制的理解以及其效率的因素。这种机制的不确定性反映了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了进一步研究以阐明这些步骤的确切作用的重要性。确定决定性步骤可以帮助指导更高效的催化剂和过程条件的发展。
