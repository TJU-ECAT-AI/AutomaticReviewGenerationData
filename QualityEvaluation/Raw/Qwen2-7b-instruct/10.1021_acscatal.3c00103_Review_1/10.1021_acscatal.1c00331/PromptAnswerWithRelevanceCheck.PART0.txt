<p>The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation.</p>
<p>A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts.</p>
<p>Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition.</p>
<p>The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support.</p>
<p>Catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by coke on metal.</p>
<p>The coke on the support does not have a noticeable influence on activity and stability.</p>
<p>The origin of higher selectivity and lower coking rate in the steady state than in the quick deactivation state could be attributed to the electronic effect and geometric effect introduced by coke deposition itself.</p>
<p>However, little progress has been achieved with regard to understanding the coke formation in detail.</p>
<p>Models A and B only discussed the relationship between the coke concentration and time.</p>
<p>The MMCGM divides the coke into two types.</p>
<p>Model D includes the polymerization of propylene and C atom adsorption as the formation of coke.</p>
<p>The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support.</p>
<p>Moreover, a small amount of water in the feed was reported to decrease the coke formation and increase the activity.</p>
<p>The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>The size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance.</p>
<p>The larger surface area of the smaller Pt particles is responsible for the higher coking rate.</p>
<p>The energy barrier of CH bond breaking is lower than the energy barrier of propylene desorption at undercoordinated sites.</p>
<p>Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH.</p>
<p>As mentioned in section 2.1, adding promoter is one of the most effective methods to modify the nature of Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>The main effect of Sn is to improve the selectivity and stability as shown in entries 13 of Table 1.</p>
<p>The improvements induced by Sn promoter are usually attributed to geometry effects and electronic effects, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of Sn led to higher dispersion of Pt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the electronic effect is also revealed.</p>
<p>The Pt cluster which is bonded with inactive spices is helpful to increase stability.</p>
<p>The Pt ensembles with connected free sites lower than 3 are unfavorable for deep dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>In recent days, the new strategies of catalysts design in PDH are proposed and verified to effectively curb coke formation.</p>
<p>The success of the catalysts was concluded from the breaking of the scaling relation between the CH bond activation energy and propene adsorption.</p>
<p>It was indicated that [PtZn4] has no obvious deactivation during a 160 h test, and the conversion drop is only 0.04%.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of Sn was uncovered to have distinct features from previous reports.</p>
<p>It was suggested that the minimal interactions between Pt and Sn are sufficient to suppress coke formation.</p>
<p>The coke deposition is still unavoidable in PDH.</p>
<p>The main method to regenerate the coke-covered catalyst is to burn coke with oxidant.</p>
<p>The coke on the support is more difficult to remove than on metal.</p>
<p>The different supports have distinct performance in burning coke.</p>
<p>The coke migration from the active metal to the support is a feasible way to keep activity.</p>
<p>Therefore, to resolve the mechanism of coke migration will require both experimental characterization and DFT simulation.</p>
<p>Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity.</p>
<p>On the basis of the previous studies, three aspects are proposed to reduce the effect of coke further:</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate about which step is rate-controlling remains ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of key reaction mechanisms and potential optimizations. To resolve this, detailed kinetic studies, including operando techniques and computational modeling, are needed to accurately characterize the reaction pathways and determine the rate-limiting step. This will aid in the development of more efficient catalysts and processes for PDH.

<p>Although there are several models available, none of them could resolve the mechanism at the molecular level.</p>
<p>The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support.</p>
<p>Moreover, hydrogens also aggregate the degree of coke graphitization which requires a higher regeneration temperature.</p>
<p>The promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability.</p>
<p>However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search.</p>
<p>The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH.</p>
<p>The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step is ongoing. The uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the rate-limiting step and the efficiency of the reaction pathway. Different mechanisms and models have been proposed to explain the kinetics of PDH, but none of them provide a complete molecular-level description. The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support, leading to higher regeneration temperatures. Promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both geometric and electronic perspectives, enhancing activity and stability. However, determining the optimal type and loading of promoter remains challenging. Strategies like the use of single atom/sites and confined Pt clusters in zeolite have shown promise in reducing coke formation, although the regeneration process still requires careful consideration to lower costs and maintain activity. The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of PDH and the need for further research to clarify the underlying mechanisms and optimize catalyst design.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于吸附过程是否是控制速率步骤还是β-H提取是控制速率步骤的争论仍在继续。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使识别速率限制步骤和反应路径效率变得复杂。提出了不同的机制和模型来解释PDH的动力学，但没有一个提供完整的分子水平描述。氢的共喂养可以去除焦炭前体并减弱支持物的酸性，导致更高的再生温度。像锡这样的促进剂可以从几何和电子两个方面调节铂的催化性能，增强活性和稳定性。然而，确定最佳类型和负载的促进剂仍然是一个挑战。单原子/位点策略和在沸石中封闭的Pt簇的应用已经显示出减少焦炭形成的可能性，尽管再生过程仍然需要仔细考虑以降低成本并维持活性。持续的争论突出了PDH的复杂性，并强调了进一步研究以澄清基本机制和优化催化剂设计的必要性。

<p>Although the process has been commercialized with high selectivity for decades, the prevention of coke deposition is still a daunting challenge.</p>
<p>The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke.</p>
<p>The coke on metal is easier to remove by oxidization than the counterpart on the support.</p>
<p>However, the coke on the support does not have a noticeable influence on activity and stability.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop an effective strategy to inhibit coke formation, as discussed in section 3.</p>
<p>The coke is formed immediately when the catalyst is exposed to propane, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis of PDH on Pt/Al2O3 shows that the coke forms rapidly in the first few minutes, and then the intensity of the coke species slowly drops to a constant over an hour.</p>
<p>The initial coke formation quickly covers the active sites. Then, the occupation of available sites significantly reduced the rates of coke formation after initial stage.</p>
<p>A more thorough kinetic model was investigated by Li et al. (59) The deep dehydrogenation and crack from propane to the C atom and the polymerization of propylene are both considered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH.</p>
<p>The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst.</p>

<p>Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH.</p>
<p>The size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance.</p>
<p>The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the phenomena is explained as the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation.</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the process where the propane molecule breaks apart upon adsorption onto the catalyst surface. β-H extraction is the subsequent step where a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the adsorbed intermediate, typically leading to the formation of a double bond. Desorption then occurs as the resulting product is released from the surface. The ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH impacts our understanding of the reaction mechanism and the factors influencing its efficiency. The uncertainty around this mechanism highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to elucidate the precise roles of these steps. The identification of the rate-controlling step could guide the development of more efficient catalysts and process conditions for PDH.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的三个关键步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附指的是丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附时断裂的过程。β-H提取是随后的步骤，其中从吸附的中间体中提取一个氢原子，通常导致双键的形成。脱附则是产物从表面释放的过程。PDH过程中，解离吸附或β-H提取哪个是决定性步骤的争论影响了我们对反应机制的理解以及其效率的因素。这种机制的不确定性反映了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了进一步研究以阐明这些步骤的确切作用的重要性。确定决定性步骤可以帮助指导更高效的催化剂和过程条件的发展。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface, where they break apart into propane radicals. The β-H extraction step involves the extraction of a hydrogen atom from one of the propane radicals, leading to the formation of a propylene radical. Finally, the desorption step allows the propylene radical to leave the catalyst surface as propylene gas. The ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because the rate of these steps determines the overall efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. Uncertainty in this area hinders the development of more efficient catalysts and optimization of the PDH process. The resolution of this debate could lead to advancements in catalyst design and reaction conditions that enhance the yield of propylene while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.
