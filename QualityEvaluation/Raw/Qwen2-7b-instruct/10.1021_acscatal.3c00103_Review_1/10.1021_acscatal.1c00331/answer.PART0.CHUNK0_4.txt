[1] "The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation."
[2] "Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."
[3] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts."
[4] "It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
[5] "However, a coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts."
[6] "It is suggested that the species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."
[7] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."
[8] "The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support."
[9] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis revealed that there are two peaks when coke elimination happens."
[10] "One peak is around 325 C, which is related to the coke on metal, and contains more hydrogens."
[11] "The other one is at higher temperature around 425 C, which is ascribed to the coke on the support."
[12] "Moreover, the coke on the support can be further categorized into two types: one is easy to remove, and the other one, mainly graphitic coke, is more resistant."
[13] "Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that cokes on PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst were nearly 3 times the counterparts on Pt/SBA-15, however the former catalyst has better activity, selectivity and stability."
[14] "This phenomenon is partly explained by the fact that coke can be transferred from metal (type1) to support (type2) and keep active sites free from coking."
[15] "Although more coke is yielded, the activity is not affected because the support accommodates most cokes."
[16] "The coke effects on the activity and durability of the catalyst are devastating and inevitable."
[17] "In this section, the composition, distribution, and effect of coking are described in detail, as they are the prerequisite knowledge to effectively curb coke and extend durability of catalyst."
[18] "The composition and distribution are the intrinsic nature of coke."
[19] "There are also more uncertainties regarding these two aspects because of the dependence on reaction condition and catalyst."
[20] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
[21] "Unfortunately, this aspect has been seldom discussed or completely neglected in previous reviews."
[22] "First of all, the coke is formed immediately when the catalyst is exposed to propane."
[23] "Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis of PDH on Pt/Al2O3 shows that the coke forms rapidly in the first few minutes, and then the intensity of the coke species slowly drops to a constant over an hour."
[24] "The initial coke formation quickly covers the active sites."
[25] "Then, the occupation of available sites significantly reduced the rates of coke formation after initial stage."
[26] "Nevertheless, several kinetic models of coke formation have been proposed."
[27] "A simple relation between the concentration of coke with time,"
[28] "was given by Voorhies."
[29] "However, little progress has been achieved with regard to understanding the coke formation in detail."
[30] "Moreover, the physical meaning of the constants is absent, which hinders the rational restraint of cokes."
[31] "A more sophisticated model called monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) was raised by Nam et al., which delivers deeper insight in describing the process of coke formation."
[32] "The formation of coke deposits is an oligomerization process."
[33] "Although those models show certain success, all of these models are still insufficient to fully cover the process of coke formation because of the extreme complexity of cokes which can arise from reactants, products, intermediates, or combinations of them."
[34] "Therefore, it is envisioned that the effective cooperation between advanced experimental techniques and microkinetic/kMC simulation which included all relevant elementary steps could further push the boundary of coke kinetics."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. Dissociative adsorption refers to the adsorption of propane molecules onto the catalyst surface, where they break apart into propane radicals. The β-H extraction step involves the extraction of a hydrogen atom from one of the propane radicals, leading to the formation of a propylene radical. Finally, the desorption step allows the propylene radical to leave the catalyst surface as propylene gas. The ongoing debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process because the rate of these steps determines the overall efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. Uncertainty in this area hinders the development of more efficient catalysts and optimization of the PDH process. The resolution of this debate could lead to advancements in catalyst design and reaction conditions that enhance the yield of propylene while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的逆Horiiuti-Polanyi机制涉及三个步骤：解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附。解离吸附是指丙烷分子在催化剂表面的吸附，其中它们分裂成丙烷自由基。β-H提取步骤涉及从一个丙烷自由基中提取一个氢原子，从而形成一个丙烯自由基。最后，脱附步骤允许丙烯自由基离开催化剂表面作为丙烯气体。关于解离吸附或β-H提取是速率控制步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为这些步骤的速率决定了反应的整体效率和选择性。在这个领域的不确定性阻碍了更高效的催化剂的发展和PDH过程的优化。解决这一辩论可能引领催化剂设计和反应条件的改进，以提高丙烯的产率并减少副产品的形成。
