The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate on whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step is ongoing. The uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of the rate-limiting step and the efficiency of the reaction pathway. Different mechanisms and models have been proposed to explain the kinetics of PDH, but none of them provide a complete molecular-level description. The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support, leading to higher regeneration temperatures. Promoters like Sn can tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both geometric and electronic perspectives, enhancing activity and stability. However, determining the optimal type and loading of promoter remains challenging. Strategies like the use of single atom/sites and confined Pt clusters in zeolite have shown promise in reducing coke formation, although the regeneration process still requires careful consideration to lower costs and maintain activity. The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of PDH and the need for further research to clarify the underlying mechanisms and optimize catalyst design.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆霍里乌蒂-波兰尼机制涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于吸附过程是否是控制速率步骤还是β-H提取是控制速率步骤的争论仍在继续。这种不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它使识别速率限制步骤和反应路径效率变得复杂。提出了不同的机制和模型来解释PDH的动力学，但没有一个提供完整的分子水平描述。氢的共喂养可以去除焦炭前体并减弱支持物的酸性，导致更高的再生温度。像锡这样的促进剂可以从几何和电子两个方面调节铂的催化性能，增强活性和稳定性。然而，确定最佳类型和负载的促进剂仍然是一个挑战。单原子/位点策略和在沸石中封闭的Pt簇的应用已经显示出减少焦炭形成的可能性，尽管再生过程仍然需要仔细考虑以降低成本并维持活性。持续的争论突出了PDH的复杂性，并强调了进一步研究以澄清基本机制和优化催化剂设计的必要性。
