The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate around the rate-controlling step in PDH is ongoing. The literature does not provide a definitive answer on whether the dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction process is the rate-controlling step. The uncertainty about this point impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it affects the kinetic modeling and the prediction of catalyst performance. The literature focuses on coke deposition and its effects rather than the mechanism details of PDH.

逆霍里图蒂-波兰尼机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程涉及三个步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。关于PDH中速率控制步骤的争论仍在继续。提供的文献没有提供关于离解吸附或β-H提取过程是速率控制步骤的明确答案。关于这一点的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了动力学建模和催化剂性能预测。文献关注的是焦炭沉积及其对催化剂的影响，而不是PDH机制的细节。
