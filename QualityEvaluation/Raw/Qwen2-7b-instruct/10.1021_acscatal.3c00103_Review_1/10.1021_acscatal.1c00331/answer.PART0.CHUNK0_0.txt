<p>The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation.</p>
<p>A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts.</p>
<p>Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition.</p>
<p>The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support.</p>
<p>Catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by coke on metal.</p>
<p>The coke on the support does not have a noticeable influence on activity and stability.</p>
<p>The origin of higher selectivity and lower coking rate in the steady state than in the quick deactivation state could be attributed to the electronic effect and geometric effect introduced by coke deposition itself.</p>
<p>However, little progress has been achieved with regard to understanding the coke formation in detail.</p>
<p>Models A and B only discussed the relationship between the coke concentration and time.</p>
<p>The MMCGM divides the coke into two types.</p>
<p>Model D includes the polymerization of propylene and C atom adsorption as the formation of coke.</p>
<p>The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support.</p>
<p>Moreover, a small amount of water in the feed was reported to decrease the coke formation and increase the activity.</p>
<p>The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>The size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance.</p>
<p>The larger surface area of the smaller Pt particles is responsible for the higher coking rate.</p>
<p>The energy barrier of CH bond breaking is lower than the energy barrier of propylene desorption at undercoordinated sites.</p>
<p>Moreover, the size and exposed surfaces are also found to influence the reaction mechanism and kinetics of PDH.</p>
<p>As mentioned in section 2.1, adding promoter is one of the most effective methods to modify the nature of Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>The main effect of Sn is to improve the selectivity and stability as shown in entries 13 of Table 1.</p>
<p>The improvements induced by Sn promoter are usually attributed to geometry effects and electronic effects, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of Sn led to higher dispersion of Pt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the electronic effect is also revealed.</p>
<p>The Pt cluster which is bonded with inactive spices is helpful to increase stability.</p>
<p>The Pt ensembles with connected free sites lower than 3 are unfavorable for deep dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>In recent days, the new strategies of catalysts design in PDH are proposed and verified to effectively curb coke formation.</p>
<p>The success of the catalysts was concluded from the breaking of the scaling relation between the CH bond activation energy and propene adsorption.</p>
<p>It was indicated that [PtZn4] has no obvious deactivation during a 160 h test, and the conversion drop is only 0.04%.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of Sn was uncovered to have distinct features from previous reports.</p>
<p>It was suggested that the minimal interactions between Pt and Sn are sufficient to suppress coke formation.</p>
<p>The coke deposition is still unavoidable in PDH.</p>
<p>The main method to regenerate the coke-covered catalyst is to burn coke with oxidant.</p>
<p>The coke on the support is more difficult to remove than on metal.</p>
<p>The different supports have distinct performance in burning coke.</p>
<p>The coke migration from the active metal to the support is a feasible way to keep activity.</p>
<p>Therefore, to resolve the mechanism of coke migration will require both experimental characterization and DFT simulation.</p>
<p>Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity.</p>
<p>On the basis of the previous studies, three aspects are proposed to reduce the effect of coke further:</p>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The debate about which step is rate-controlling remains ongoing. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process by complicating the identification of key reaction mechanisms and potential optimizations. To resolve this, detailed kinetic studies, including operando techniques and computational modeling, are needed to accurately characterize the reaction pathways and determine the rate-limiting step. This will aid in the development of more efficient catalysts and processes for PDH.
