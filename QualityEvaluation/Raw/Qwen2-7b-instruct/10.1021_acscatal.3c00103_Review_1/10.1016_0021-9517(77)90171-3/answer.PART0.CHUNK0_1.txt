The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. However, the literature does not provide detailed information about these steps. It only mentions that the rate-determining step of the reaction is (C3H8)a → (C3H6)a + (H2)a. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process because it leaves open the question of which of the two processes—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step. The lack of clarity on this point hinders a complete mechanistic understanding of the PDH reaction.
