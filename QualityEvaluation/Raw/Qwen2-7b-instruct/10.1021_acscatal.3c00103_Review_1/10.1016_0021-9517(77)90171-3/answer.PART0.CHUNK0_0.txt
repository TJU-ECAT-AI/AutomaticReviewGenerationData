[1] "The reactions were carried out in conventional closed static reactor at temperatures ranging from 443 to 505 C."
[2] "The rates were obtained from the initial slope of the pressure-time curves."
[3] "It was concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. In the context of this study, the rate-determining step of the PDH reaction was identified as (C3H8)a → (C3H6)a + (H2)a. This finding contributes to the ongoing debate about which of these two processes, dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction, is the rate-controlling step in PDH. The uncertainty regarding this matter impacts our understanding of the PDH process, as it influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.

逆霍里图-波兰尼机制对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）包括三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。在本研究中，PDH反应的决定性步骤被确定为(C3H8)a → (C3H6)a + (H2)a。这一发现参与了关于这两个过程中的哪一个，离解吸附或β-H提取，在PDH中是控制速率步骤的持续辩论。这种不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响了反应的效率和选择性。
