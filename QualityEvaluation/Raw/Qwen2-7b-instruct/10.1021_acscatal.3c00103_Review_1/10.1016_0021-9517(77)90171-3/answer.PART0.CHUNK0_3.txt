The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three key steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The document does not explicitly describe these steps but provides information that can be used to infer their roles. In the context of PDH, dissociative adsorption refers to the process where propane molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface by breaking one or more hydrogen bonds. β-H extraction is the removal of a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule during the adsorption process. Desorption then occurs when the resulting products, propylene and hydrogen, are released from the surface. 

The ongoing debate regarding which step—dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction—is the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process. The document states that the rate-determining step of the reaction is represented by the equation (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a, indicating that the overall reaction rate is influenced by the conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen. This suggests that both dissociative adsorption and β-H extraction play crucial roles in the reaction mechanism, although the specific dynamics of each step might require further investigation to fully resolve the debate.

This uncertainty highlights the complexity of PDH and the importance of detailed kinetic studies to elucidate the precise sequence of events involved in the reaction mechanism.

反转Horiuti-Polanyi机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的三个关键步骤：离解吸附、β-H提取和脱附。文档没有明确描述这些步骤，但提供了可以用来推断它们作用的信息。在PDH的背景下，离解吸附指的是通过断裂一个或多个氢键将丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面的过程。β-H提取是在吸附过程中从丙烷分子中移除一个氢原子。脱附则发生在产物，即丙烯和氢气，从表面释放时。

关于哪一步——离解吸附还是β-H提取——是控制速率的步骤的争论影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。文档表明反应的决定性步骤由方程式（C3H8）a  （C3H6）a + （H2）a表示，这表明整个反应速率受丙烷转化为丙烯和氢的影响。这表明离解吸附和β-H提取在反应机制中都扮演着关键角色，尽管每一步的具体动态可能需要进一步的研究来完全解决这一辩论。

这种不确定性突显了PDH的复杂性以及详细动力学研究揭示反应机制精确事件序列的重要性。
