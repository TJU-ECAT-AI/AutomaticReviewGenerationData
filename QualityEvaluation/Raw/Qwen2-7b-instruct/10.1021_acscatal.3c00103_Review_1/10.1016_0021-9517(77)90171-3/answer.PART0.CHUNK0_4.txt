The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three steps: dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption. The literature does not explicitly state which step is the rate-controlling one, but it impacts our understanding of the PDH process by highlighting the complexity of the reaction mechanism.
